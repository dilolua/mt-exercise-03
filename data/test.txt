Now you know you are , ” he said .
“ Don ’ t you ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” I said .
“ And what are you crying for ? ” said the gentleman , “ Don ’ t you want to go there ? ” “ Where , sir ? ” “ Where ?
Why , wherever you are going , ” said the gentleman .
“ I am very glad to go there , sir , ” I answered .
“ Well , then !
Look glad ! ” said the gentleman .
I thought he was very strange , or at least that what I could see of him was very strange , for he was wrapped up to the chin , and his face was almost hidden in a fur cap with broad fur <unk> at the side of his head fastened under his chin ; but I was composed again , and not afraid of him .
So I told him that I thought I must have been crying because of my godmother ’ s death and because of Mrs. Rachael ’ s not being sorry to part with me .
“ <unk> Mrs. Rachael ! ” said the gentleman .
“ Let her fly away in a high wind on a <unk> ! ” I began to be really afraid of him now and looked at him with the greatest astonishment .
But I thought that he had pleasant eyes , although he kept on muttering to himself in an angry manner and calling Mrs. Rachael names .
After a little while he opened his outer <unk> , which appeared to me large enough to <unk> up the whole coach , and put his arm down into a deep pocket in the side .
“ Now , look here ! ” he said .
“ In this paper , ” which was <unk> folded , “ is a piece of the best <unk> that can be got for money — <unk> on the outside an <unk> thick , like fat on mutton chops .
Here ’ s a little <unk> ( a <unk> this is , both for size and quality ) , made in <unk> .
And what do you suppose it ’ s made of ?
<unk> of fat <unk> .
There ’ s a <unk> !
Now let ’ s see you eat ’ em . ” “ Thank you , sir , ” I replied ; “ thank you very much indeed , but I hope you won ’ t be offended — they are too rich for me . ” “ <unk> again ! ” said the gentleman , which I didn ’ t at all understand , and threw them both out of window .
He did not speak to me any more until he got out of the coach a little way short of Reading , when he advised me to be a good girl and to be <unk> , and shook hands with me .
I must say I was relieved by his departure .
We left him at a <unk> .
I often walked past it afterwards , and never for a long time without thinking of him and half expecting to meet him .
But I never did ; and so , as time went on , he passed out of my mind .
When the coach stopped , a very neat lady looked up at the window and said , “ Miss Donny . ” “ No , ma ’ am , Esther Summerson . ” “ That is quite right , ” said the lady , “ Miss Donny . ” I now understood that she <unk> herself by that name , and begged Miss Donny ’ s pardon for my mistake , and pointed out my boxes at her request .
Under the direction of a very neat maid , they were put outside a very small green carriage ; and then Miss Donny , the maid , and I got inside and were driven away .
“ Everything is ready for you , Esther , ” said Miss Donny , “ and the scheme of your pursuits has been arranged in exact <unk> with the wishes of your guardian , Mr. Jarndyce . ” “ Of — did you say , ma ’ am ? ” “ Of your guardian , Mr. Jarndyce , ” said Miss Donny .
I was so <unk> that Miss Donny thought the cold had been too severe for me and <unk> me her <unk> .
“ Do you know my — guardian , Mr. Jarndyce , ma ’ am ? ” I asked after a good deal of hesitation .
“ Not personally , Esther , ” said Miss Donny ; “ merely through his solicitors , Messrs. Kenge and Carboy , of London .
A very superior gentleman , Mr. Kenge .
Truly eloquent indeed .
Some of his periods quite majestic ! ” I felt this to be very true but was too confused to attend to it .
Our <unk> arrival at our destination , before I had time to recover myself , increased my confusion , and I never shall forget the uncertain and the <unk> air of everything at Greenleaf ( Miss Donny ’ s house ) that afternoon !
But I soon became used to it .
I was so adapted to the <unk> of Greenleaf before long that I seemed to have been there a great while and almost to have dreamed rather than really lived my old life at my godmother ’ s .
Nothing could be more <unk> , exact , and orderly than Greenleaf .
There was a time for everything all round the <unk> of the clock , and everything was done at its appointed moment .
We were twelve <unk> , and there were two Miss <unk> , <unk> .
It was understood that I would have to depend , by and by , on my <unk> as a <unk> , and I was not only <unk> in everything that was taught at Greenleaf , but was very soon engaged in helping to <unk> others .
Although I was treated in every other respect like the rest of the school , this single difference was made in my case from the first .
As I began to know more , I taught more , and so in course of time I had plenty to do , which I was very fond of doing because it made the dear girls fond of me .
At last , whenever a new pupil came who was a little <unk> and unhappy , she was so sure — indeed I don ’ t know why — to make a friend of me that all <unk> were confided to my care .
They said I was so gentle , but I am sure THEY were !
I often thought of the resolution I had made on my birthday to try to be industrious , contented , and <unk> and to do some good to some one and win some love if I could ; and indeed , indeed , I felt almost ashamed to have done so little and have won so much .
I passed at Greenleaf six happy , quiet years .
I never saw in any face there , thank heaven , on my birthday , that it would have been better if I had never been born .
When the day came round , it brought me so many tokens of affectionate remembrance that my room was beautiful with them from New <unk> ’ s Day to <unk> .
In those six years I had never been away except on visits at <unk> time in the neighbourhood .
After the first six months or so I had taken Miss Donny ’ s advice in reference to the <unk> of writing to Mr. Kenge to say that I was happy and grateful , and with her approval I had written such a letter .
I had received a formal answer <unk> its receipt and saying , “ We note the contents thereof , which shall be <unk> communicated to our client . ” After that I sometimes heard Miss Donny and her sister mention how regular my accounts were paid , and about twice a year I ventured to write a similar letter .
I always received by return of post exactly the same answer in the same round hand , with the <unk> of Kenge and Carboy in another writing , which I supposed to be Mr. Kenge ’ s .
It seems so curious to me to be obliged to write all this about myself !
As if this narrative were the narrative of MY life !
But my little body will soon fall into the <unk> now .
Six quiet years ( I find I am saying it for the second time ) I had passed at Greenleaf , seeing in those around me , as it might be in a <unk> , every stage of my own growth and change there , when , one November morning , I received this letter .
I <unk> the date .
Old Square , Lincoln ’ s Inn <unk> , Jarndyce and Jarndyce Our <unk> Mr. Jarndyce being <unk> to <unk> into his house , under an <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> in this cause , for whom he wishes to <unk> an <unk> <unk> , directs us to inform you that he will be glad of your <unk> in the <unk> capacity .
We have <unk> for your being <unk> , carriage free , <unk> eight o ’ clock coach from Reading , on <unk> morning next , to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , London , where one of our <unk> will be in waiting to <unk> you to our <unk> as above .
We are , <unk> , Your <unk> <unk> , Kenge and Carboy Miss Esther Summerson Oh , never , never , never shall I forget the emotion this letter caused in the house !
It was so tender in them to care so much for me , it was so gracious in that father who had not forgotten me to have made my orphan way so smooth and easy and to have inclined so many youthful <unk> towards me , that I could hardly bear it .
Not that I would have had them less sorry — I am afraid not ; but the pleasure of it , and the pain of it , and the pride and joy of it , and the humble regret of it were so <unk> that my heart seemed almost breaking while it was full of rapture .
The letter gave me only five days ’ notice of my removal .
When every minute added to the <unk> of love and kindness that were given me in those five days , and when at last the morning came and when they took me through all the rooms that I might see them for the last time , and when some cried , “ Esther , dear , say good-bye to me here at my bedside , where you first spoke so kindly to me ! ” and when others asked me only to write their names , “ With Esther ’ s love , ” and when they all surrounded me with their parting presents and clung to me weeping and cried , “ What shall we do when dear , dear Esther ’ s gone ! ” and when I tried to tell them how <unk> and how good they had all been to me and how I blessed and thanked them every one , what a heart I had !
And when the two Miss <unk> grieved as much to part with me as the least among them , and when the <unk> said , “ Bless you , miss , wherever you go ! ” and when the ugly lame old gardener , who I thought had hardly noticed me in all those years , came panting after the coach to give me a little nosegay of <unk> and told me I had been the light of his eyes — indeed the old man said so ! — what a heart I had then !
And could I help it if with all this , and the coming to the little school , and the unexpected sight of the poor children outside waving their <unk> and bonnets to me , and of a <unk> gentleman and lady whose daughter I had helped to teach and at whose house I had visited ( who were said to be the <unk> people in all that country ) , <unk> for nothing but calling out , “ Good-bye , Esther .
May you be very happy ! ” — could I help it if I was quite bowed down in the coach by myself and said “ Oh , I am so thankful , I am so thankful ! ” many times over !
But of course I soon considered that I must not take tears where I was going after all that had been done for me .
Therefore , of course , I made myself sob less and persuaded myself to be quiet by saying very often , “ Esther , now you really must !
This WILL NOT do ! ” I <unk> myself up pretty well at last , though I am afraid I was longer about it than I ought to have been ; and when I had <unk> my eyes with <unk> water , it was time to watch for London .
I was quite persuaded that we were there when we were ten miles off , and when we really were there , that we should never get there .
However , when we began to <unk> upon a stone pavement , and particularly when every other <unk> seemed to be running into us , and we seemed to be running into every other <unk> , I began to believe that we really were approaching the end of our journey .
Very soon afterwards we stopped .
A young gentleman who had <unk> himself by accident addressed me from the pavement and said , “ I am from Kenge and Carboy ’ s , miss , of Lincoln ’ s Inn . ” “ If you please , sir , ” said I.
He was very obliging , and as he handed me into a fly after <unk> the removal of my boxes , I asked him whether there was a great fire anywhere ?
For the streets were so full of dense brown smoke that scarcely anything was to be seen .
“ Oh , dear no , miss , ” he said .
“ This is a London particular . ” I had never heard of such a thing .
“ A fog , miss , ” said the young gentleman .
“ Oh , indeed ! ” said I.
We drove slowly through the <unk> and <unk> streets that ever were seen in the world ( I thought ) and in such a <unk> state of confusion that I wondered how the people kept their senses , until we passed into sudden <unk> under an old gateway and drove on through a silent square until we came to an odd <unk> in a corner , where there was an entrance up a <unk> , broad flight of stairs , like an entrance to a church .
And there really was a churchyard outside under some <unk> , for I saw the <unk> from the staircase window .
This was Kenge and Carboy ’ s .
The young gentleman showed me through an outer office into Mr. Kenge ’ s room — there was no one in it — and politely put an arm-chair for me by the fire .
He then called my attention to a little <unk> hanging from a <unk> on one side of the chimney-piece .
“ In case you should wish to look at yourself , miss , after the journey , as you ’ re going before the Chancellor .
Not that it ’ s <unk> , I am sure , ” said the young gentleman <unk> .
“ Going before the Chancellor ? ” I said , startled for a moment .
“ Only a matter of form , miss , ” returned the young gentleman .
“ Mr.
Kenge is in court now .
He left his compliments , and would you partake of some refreshment ” — there were <unk> and a <unk> of wine on a small table — “ and look over the paper , ” which the young gentleman gave me as he spoke .
He then stirred the fire and left me .
Everything was so strange — the stranger from its being night in the <unk> , the candles burning with a white <unk> , and looking raw and cold — that I read the words in the newspaper without knowing what they meant and found myself reading the same words repeatedly .
As it was of no use going on in that way , I put the paper down , took a peep at my bonnet in the glass to see if it was neat , and looked at the room , which was not half lighted , and at the shabby , dusty tables , and at the piles of <unk> , and at a <unk> full of the most <unk> books that ever had anything to say for themselves .
Then I went on , thinking , thinking , thinking ; and the fire went on , burning , burning , burning ; and the candles went on <unk> and <unk> , and there were no <unk> — until the young gentleman by and by brought a very dirty pair — for two hours .
At last Mr. Kenge came .
HE was not altered , but he was surprised to see how altered I was and appeared quite pleased .
“ As you are going to be the companion of the young lady who is now in the Chancellor ’ s private room , Miss Summerson , ” he said , “ we thought it well that you should be in attendance also .
You will not be <unk> by the Lord Chancellor , I dare say ? ” “ No , sir , ” I said , “ I don ’ t think I shall , ” really not seeing on consideration why I should be .
So Mr. Kenge gave me his arm and we went round the corner , under a <unk> , and in at a side door .
And so we came , along a passage , into a comfortable sort of room where a young lady and a young gentleman were standing near a great , <unk> fire .
A screen was interposed between them and it , and they were leaning on the screen , talking .
They both looked up when I came in , and I saw in the young lady , with the fire shining upon her , such a beautiful girl !
With such rich golden hair , such soft blue eyes , and such a bright , innocent , trusting face !
“ Miss Ada , ” said Mr. Kenge , “ this is Miss Summerson . ” She came to meet me with a smile of welcome and her hand extended , but seemed to change her mind in a moment and kissed me .
In short , she had such a natural , captivating , <unk> manner that in a few minutes we were sitting in the window-seat , with the light of the fire upon us , talking together as free and happy as could be .
What a load off my mind !
It was so delightful to know that she could confide in me and like me !
It was so good of her , and so encouraging to me !
The young gentleman was her distant cousin , she told me , and his name Richard Carstone .
He was a handsome youth with an ingenuous face and a most engaging laugh ; and after she had called him up to where we sat , he stood by us , in the light of the fire , talking gaily , like a light-hearted boy .
He was very young , not more than <unk> then , if quite so much , but nearly two years older than she was .
They were both <unk> and ( what was very unexpected and curious to me ) had never met before that day .
Our all three coming together for the first time in such an unusual place was a thing to talk about , and we talked about it ; and the fire , which had left off <unk> , <unk> its red eyes at us — as Richard said — like a drowsy old Chancery <unk> .
We <unk> in a low tone because a <unk> gentleman in a bag wig frequently came in and out , and when he did so , we could hear a <unk> sound in the distance , which he said was one of the counsel in our case addressing the Lord Chancellor .
He told Mr. Kenge that the Chancellor would be up in five minutes ; and presently we heard a bustle and a tread of feet , and Mr. Kenge said that the Court had risen and his lordship was in the next room .
The gentleman in the bag wig opened the door almost directly and requested Mr. Kenge to come in .
Upon that , we all went into the next room , Mr. Kenge first , with my darling — it is so natural to me now that I can ’ t help writing it ; and there , plainly dressed in black and sitting in an arm-chair at a table near the fire , was his lordship , whose <unk> , <unk> with beautiful gold <unk> , was thrown upon another chair .
He gave us a searching look as we entered , but his manner was both courtly and kind .
The gentleman in the bag wig laid bundles of papers on his lordship ’ s table , and his lordship silently <unk> one and turned over the leaves .
“ Miss Clare , ” said the Lord Chancellor .
“ Miss Ada Clare ? ” Mr. Kenge presented her , and his lordship begged her to sit down near him .
That he admired her and was interested by her even I could see in a moment .
It touched me that the home of such a beautiful young creature should be represented by that dry , official place .
The Lord High Chancellor , at his best , appeared so poor a <unk> for the love and pride of parents .
“ The Jarndyce in question , ” said the Lord Chancellor , still turning over leaves , “ is Jarndyce of Bleak House . ” “ Jarndyce of Bleak House , my lord , ” said Mr. Kenge .
“ A dreary name , ” said the Lord Chancellor .
“ But not a dreary place at present , my lord , ” said Mr. Kenge .
“ And Bleak House , ” said his lordship , “ is in — ” “ <unk> , my lord . ” “ Mr.
Jarndyce of Bleak House is not married ? ” said his lordship .
“ He is not , my lord , ” said Mr. Kenge .
A pause .
“ Young Mr. Richard Carstone is present ? ” said the Lord Chancellor , glancing towards him .
Richard bowed and <unk> forward .
“ Hum ! ” said the Lord Chancellor , turning over more leaves .
“ Mr.
Jarndyce of Bleak House , my lord , ” Mr. Kenge observed in a low voice , “ if I may venture to remind your lordship , <unk> a suitable companion for — ” “ For Mr. Richard Carstone ? ” I thought ( but I am not quite sure ) I heard his lordship say in an equally low voice and with a smile .
“ For Miss Ada Clare .
This is the young lady .
Miss Summerson . ” His lordship gave me an <unk> look and acknowledged my curtsy very <unk> .
“ Miss Summerson is not related to any party in the cause , I think ? ” “ No , my lord . ” Mr. Kenge <unk> over before it was quite said and whispered .
His lordship , with his eyes upon his papers , listened , nodded twice or <unk> , turned over more leaves , and did not look towards me again until we were going away .
Mr. Kenge now retired , and Richard with him , to where I was , near the door , leaving my pet ( it is so natural to me that again I can ’ t help it ! )
sitting near the Lord Chancellor , with whom his lordship spoke a little part , asking her , as she told me afterwards , whether she had well reflected on the proposed arrangement , and if she thought she would be happy under the roof of Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House , and why she thought so ?
Presently he rose <unk> and released her , and then he spoke for a minute or two with Richard Carstone , not seated , but standing , and altogether with more ease and less ceremony , as if he still knew , though he WAS Lord Chancellor , how to go straight to the candour of a boy .
“ Very well ! ” said his lordship aloud .
“ I shall make the order .
Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House has chosen , so far as I may judge , ” and this was when he looked at me , “ a very good companion for the young lady , and the arrangement altogether seems the best of which the circumstances admit . ” He dismissed us pleasantly , and we all went out , very much obliged to him for being so affable and polite , by which he had certainly lost no dignity but seemed to us to have gained some .
When we got under the <unk> , Mr. Kenge remembered that he must go back for a moment to ask a question and left us in the fog , with the Lord Chancellor ’ s carriage and servants waiting for him to come out .
“ Well ! ” said Richard Carstone .
“ THAT ’ S over !
And where do we go next , Miss Summerson ? ” “ Don ’ t you know ? ” I said .
“ Not in the least , ” said he .
“ And don ’ t YOU know , my love ? ” I asked Ada .
“ No ! ” said she .
“ Don ’ t you ? ” “ Not at all ! ” said I.
We looked at one another , half laughing at our being like the children in the wood , when a curious little old woman in a squeezed bonnet and carrying a reticule came <unk> and smiling up to us with an air of great ceremony .
“ Oh ! ” said she .
“ The wards in Jarndyce !
Ve-ry happy , I am sure , to have the honour !
It is a good omen for youth , and hope , and beauty when they find themselves in this place , and don ’ t know what ’ s to come of it . ” “ <unk> ! ” whispered Richard , not thinking she could hear him .
“ Right !
<unk> , young gentleman , ” she returned so quickly that he was quite abashed .
“ I was a ward myself .
I was not mad at that time , ” <unk> low and smiling between every little sentence .
“ I had youth and hope .
I believe , beauty .
It matters very little now .
Neither of the three served or saved me .
I have the honour to attend court regularly .
With my documents .
I expect a judgment .
<unk> .
On the Day of <unk> .
I have discovered that the <unk> seal mentioned in the <unk> is the Great Seal .
It has been open a long time !
Pray accept my blessing . ” As Ada was a little frightened , I said , to humour the poor old lady , that we were much obliged to her .
“ Ye-es ! ” she said <unk> .
“ I imagine so .
And here is Conversation Kenge .
With HIS documents !
How does your honourable <unk> do ? ” “ Quite well , quite well !
Now don ’ t be troublesome , that ’ s a good soul ! ” said Mr. Kenge , leading the way back .
“ By no means , ” said the poor old lady , keeping up with Ada and me .
“ Anything but troublesome .
I shall confer <unk> on both — which is not being troublesome , I trust ?
I expect a judgment .
<unk> .
On the Day of <unk> .
This is a good omen for you .
<unk> my blessing ! ” She stopped at the bottom of the <unk> , broad flight of stairs ; but we looked back as we went up , and she was still there , saying , still with a curtsy and a smile between every little sentence , “ <unk> .
And hope .
And beauty .
And Chancery .
And Conversation Kenge !
Ha !
Pray accept my blessing ! ” CHAPTER <unk> <unk> <unk> We were to pass the night , Mr. Kenge told us when we arrived in his room , at Mrs. Jellyby ’ s ; and then he turned to me and said he took it for granted I knew who Mrs. Jellyby was .
“ I really don ’ t , sir , ” I returned .
“ Perhaps Mr. Carstone — or Miss Clare — ” But no , they knew nothing whatever about Mrs. Jellyby .
“ <unk> !
Mrs. Jellyby , ” said Mr. Kenge , standing with his back to the fire and casting his eyes over the dusty <unk> as if it were Mrs. Jellyby ’ s <unk> , “ is a lady of very remarkable strength of character who <unk> herself entirely to the public .
She has devoted herself to an <unk> variety of public subjects at various times and is at present ( until something else <unk> her ) devoted to the subject of Africa , with a view to the general <unk> of the coffee <unk> — AND the natives — and the happy settlement , on the <unk> of the African <unk> , of our <unk> home <unk> .
Mr. Jarndyce , who is desirous to aid any work that is considered likely to be a good work and who is much sought after by <unk> , has , I believe , a very high opinion of Mrs. Jellyby . ” Mr. Kenge , adjusting his cravat , then looked at us .
“ And Mr. Jellyby , sir ? ” suggested Richard .
“ Ah !
Mr. Jellyby , ” said Mr. Kenge , “ is — a — I don ’ t know that I can describe him to you better than by saying that he is the husband of Mrs. Jellyby . ” “ A <unk> , sir ? ” said Richard with a droll look .
“ I don ’ t say that , ” returned Mr. Kenge gravely .
“ I can ’ t say that , indeed , for I know nothing whatever OF Mr. Jellyby .
I never , to my knowledge , had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Jellyby .
He may be a very superior man , but he is , so to speak , <unk> — <unk> — in the more shining qualities of his wife . ” Mr. Kenge proceeded to tell us that as the road to Bleak House would have been very long , dark , and <unk> on such an evening , and as we had been travelling already , Mr. Jarndyce had himself proposed this arrangement .
A carriage would be at Mrs. Jellyby ’ s to <unk> us out of town early in the <unk> of to-morrow .
He then rang a little bell , and the young gentleman came in .
<unk> him by the name of Guppy , Mr. Kenge inquired whether Miss Summerson ’ s boxes and the rest of the <unk> had been “ sent round . ” Mr. Guppy said yes , they had been sent round , and a coach was waiting to take us round too as soon as we pleased .
“ Then it only remains , ” said Mr. Kenge , shaking hands with us , “ for me to express my lively satisfaction in ( good day , Miss Clare ! )
the arrangement this day concluded and my ( <unk> to you , Miss Summerson ! )
lively hope that it will <unk> to the happiness , the ( glad to have had the honour of making your acquaintance , Mr.
Carstone ! )
welfare , the advantage in all points of view , of all concerned !
Guppy , see the party safely there . ” “ Where IS ‘ there , ’ Mr. Guppy ? ” said Richard as we went downstairs .
“ No distance , ” said Mr. Guppy ; “ round in Thavies Inn , you know . ” “ I can ’ t say I know where it is , for I come from <unk> and am strange in London . ” “ Only round the corner , ” said Mr. Guppy .
“ We just twist up Chancery Lane , and cut along Holborn , and there we are in four minutes ’ time , as near as a <unk> .
This is about a London particular <unk> , ain ’ t it , miss ? ” He seemed quite delighted with it on my account .
“ The fog is very dense indeed ! ” said I.
“ Not that it <unk> you , though , I ’ m sure , ” said Mr. Guppy , putting up the steps .
“ On the contrary , it seems to do you good , miss , judging from your appearance . ” I knew he meant well in paying me this compliment , so I laughed at myself for blushing at it when he had shut the door and got upon the box ; and we all three laughed and <unk> about our <unk> and the <unk> of London until we turned up under an archway to our destination — a narrow street of high houses like an <unk> <unk> to hold the fog .
There was a confused little crowd of people , principally children , gathered about the house at which we stopped , which had a <unk> <unk> plate on the door with the inscription <unk> .
“ Don ’ t be frightened ! ” said Mr. Guppy , looking in at the <unk> .
“ One of the young <unk> been and got his head through the area <unk> ! ” “ Oh , poor child , ” said I ; “ let me out , if you please ! ” “ Pray be careful of yourself , miss .
The young <unk> are always up to something , ” said Mr. Guppy .
I made my way to the poor child , who was one of the <unk> little <unk> I ever saw , and found him very hot and frightened and crying <unk> , fixed by the neck between two iron <unk> , while a <unk> and a beadle , with the <unk> intentions possible , were endeavouring to <unk> him back by the legs , under a general impression that his <unk> was <unk> by those means .
As I found ( after <unk> him ) that he was a little boy with a naturally large head , I thought that perhaps where his head could go , his body could follow , and mentioned that the best mode of <unk> might be to <unk> him forward .
This was so <unk> received by the <unk> and beadle that he would immediately have been pushed into the area if I had not held his <unk> while Richard and Mr. Guppy ran down through the kitchen to catch him when he should be released .
At last he was happily got down without any accident , and then he began to beat Mr. Guppy with a <unk> in quite a <unk> manner .
Nobody had appeared belonging to the house except a person in pattens , who had been <unk> at the child from below with a broom ; I don ’ t know with what object , and I don ’ t think she did .
I therefore supposed that Mrs. Jellyby was not at home , and was quite surprised when the person appeared in the passage without the pattens , and going up to the back room on the first floor before Ada and me , announced us as , “ <unk> two young ladies , <unk> Jellyby ! ” We passed several more children on the way up , whom it was difficult to avoid <unk> on in the dark ; and as we came into Mrs. Jellyby ’ s presence , one of the poor little things fell downstairs — down a whole flight ( as it sounded to me ) , with a great noise .
Mrs. Jellyby , whose face reflected none of the uneasiness which we could not help showing in our own faces as the dear child ’ s head <unk> its passage with a <unk> on every <unk> — Richard afterwards said he counted seven , besides one for the landing — received us with perfect <unk> .
She was a pretty , very <unk> , <unk> woman of from forty to fifty , with handsome eyes , though they had a curious habit of seeming to look a long way off .
As if — I am <unk> Richard again — they could see nothing nearer than Africa !
“ I am very glad indeed , ” said Mrs. Jellyby in an agreeable voice , “ to have the pleasure of receiving you .
I have a great respect for Mr. Jarndyce , and no one in whom he is interested can be an object of indifference to me . ” We expressed our <unk> and sat down behind the door , where there was a lame <unk> of a sofa .
Mrs. Jellyby had very good hair but was too much occupied with her African duties to brush it .
The shawl in which she had been <unk> muffled dropped <unk> her chair when she advanced to us ; and as she turned to resume her seat , we could not help noticing that her dress didn ’ t nearly meet up the back and that the open space was <unk> across with a <unk> of <unk> — like a <unk> .
The room , which was <unk> with papers and nearly filled by a great <unk> covered with similar litter , was , I must say , not only very untidy but very dirty .
We were obliged to take notice of that with our sense of sight , even while , with our sense of hearing , we followed the poor child who had tumbled downstairs : I think into the back kitchen , where somebody seemed to <unk> him .
But what principally struck us was a <unk> and <unk> though by no means plain girl at the <unk> , who sat biting the <unk> of her pen and staring at us .
I suppose nobody ever was in such a state of ink .
And from her tumbled hair to her pretty feet , which were <unk> with <unk> and broken <unk> <unk> trodden down at <unk> , she really seemed to have no article of dress upon her , from a <unk> <unk> , that was in its proper condition or its right place .
“ You find me , my dears , ” said Mrs. Jellyby , <unk> the two great office candles in tin candlesticks , which made the room taste strongly of hot <unk> ( the fire had gone out , and there was nothing in the grate but ashes , a bundle of wood , and a <unk> ) , “ you find me , my dears , as usual , very busy ; but that you will excuse .
The African project at present <unk> my whole time .
It <unk> me in correspondence with public bodies and with private <unk> anxious for the welfare of their species all over the country .
I am happy to say it is advancing .
We hope by this time next year to have from a hundred and fifty to two hundred healthy families <unk> coffee and <unk> the natives of Borrioboola-Gha , on the left bank of the <unk> . ” As Ada said nothing , but looked at me , I said it must be very gratifying .
“ It IS gratifying , ” said Mrs. Jellyby .
“ It <unk> the devotion of all my <unk> , such as they are ; but that is nothing , so that it <unk> ; and I am more confident of success every day .
Do you know , Miss Summerson , I almost wonder that YOU never turned your thoughts to Africa . ” This application of the subject was really so unexpected to me that I was quite at a loss how to receive it .
I hinted that the <unk> — “ The <unk> <unk> in the world ! ” said Mrs. Jellyby .
“ Indeed , ma ’ am ? ” “ Certainly .
With precaution , ” said Mrs. Jellyby .
“ You may go into Holborn , without precaution , and be run over .
You may go into Holborn , with precaution , and never be run over .
Just so with Africa . ” I said , “ No doubt . ” I meant as to Holborn .
“ If you would like , ” said Mrs. Jellyby , putting a number of papers towards us , “ to look over some remarks on that head , and on the general subject , which have been <unk> <unk> , while I finish a letter I am now <unk> to my eldest daughter , who is my <unk> — ” The girl at the table left off biting her pen and made a return to our recognition , which was half <unk> and half sulky .
“ — I shall then have finished for the present , ” proceeded Mrs. Jellyby with a sweet smile , “ though my work is never done .
Where are you , Caddy ? ” “ ‘ <unk> her compliments to Mr.
<unk> , and begs — ’ ” said Caddy .
“ ‘ And begs , ’ ” said Mrs. Jellyby , <unk> , “ ‘ to inform him , in reference to his letter of inquiry on the African project — ’ No , Peepy !
Not on my account ! ” Peepy ( so <unk> ) was the unfortunate child who had fallen downstairs , who now interrupted the correspondence by <unk> himself , with a <unk> of <unk> on his forehead , to <unk> his wounded knees , in which Ada and I did not know which to pity most — the <unk> or the dirt .
Mrs. Jellyby merely added , with the serene composure with which she said everything , “ Go along , you <unk> Peepy ! ” and fixed her fine eyes on Africa again .
However , as she at once proceeded with her <unk> , and as I interrupted nothing by doing it , I ventured quietly to stop poor Peepy as he was going out and to take him up to nurse .
He looked very much astonished at it and at Ada ’ s kissing him , but soon fell fast asleep in my arms , sobbing at longer and longer intervals , until he was quiet .
I was so occupied with Peepy that I lost the letter in detail , though I derived such a general impression from it of the <unk> importance of Africa , and the utter <unk> of all other places and things , that I felt quite ashamed to have thought so little about it .
“ Six o ’ clock ! ” said Mrs. Jellyby .
“ And our dinner hour is <unk> ( for we dine at all hours ) five !
Caddy , show Miss Clare and Miss Summerson their rooms .
You will like to make some change , perhaps ?
You will excuse me , I know , being so much occupied .
Oh , that very bad child !
Pray put him down , Miss Summerson ! ” I begged permission to retain him , truly saying that he was not at all troublesome , and carried him upstairs and laid him on my bed .
Ada and I had two upper rooms with a door of communication between .
They were <unk> bare and <unk> , and the curtain to my window was fastened up with a fork .
“ You would like some hot water , wouldn ’ t you ? ” said Miss Jellyby , looking round for a <unk> with a handle to it , but looking in vain .
“ If it is not being troublesome , ” said we .
“ Oh , it ’ s not the trouble , ” returned Miss Jellyby ; “ the question is , if there IS any . ” The evening was so very cold and the rooms had such a <unk> smell that I must confess it was a little miserable , and Ada was half crying .
We soon laughed , however , and were busily <unk> when Miss Jellyby came back to say that she was sorry there was no hot water , but they couldn ’ t find the <unk> , and the <unk> was out of order .
We begged her not to mention it and made all the haste we could to get down to the fire again .
But all the little children had come up to the landing outside to look at the phenomenon of Peepy lying on my bed , and our attention was <unk> by the constant <unk> of <unk> and fingers in <unk> of danger between the <unk> of the doors .
It was impossible to shut the door of either room , for my lock , with no <unk> to it , looked as if it wanted to be wound up ; and though the handle of Ada ’ s went round and round with the greatest <unk> , it was attended with no effect whatever on the door .
Therefore I proposed to the children that they should come in and be very good at my table , and I would tell them the story of Little <unk> <unk> <unk> while I dressed ; which they did , and were as quiet as <unk> , including Peepy , who awoke <unk> before the appearance of the <unk> .
When we went downstairs we found a <unk> with “ A <unk> from <unk> <unk> ” on it lighted up in the staircase window with a <unk> <unk> , and a young woman , with a swelled face bound up in a <unk> <unk> blowing the fire of the drawing-room ( now connected by an open door with Mrs. Jellyby ’ s room ) and choking dreadfully .
It smoked to that degree , in short , that we all sat coughing and crying with the windows open for half an hour , during which Mrs. Jellyby , with the same <unk> of temper , directed letters about Africa .
Her being so employed was , I must say , a great relief to me , for Richard told us that he had washed his hands in a <unk> and that they had found the <unk> on his <unk> , and he made Ada laugh so that they made me laugh in the most ridiculous manner .
<unk> after seven o ’ clock we went down to dinner , carefully , by Mrs. Jellyby ’ s advice , for the <unk> , besides being very deficient in <unk> , were so torn as to be <unk> <unk> .
We had a fine <unk> , a piece of <unk> <unk> , a dish of <unk> , and a <unk> ; an excellent dinner , if it had had any <unk> to speak of , but it was almost raw .
The young woman with the <unk> <unk> waited , and dropped everything on the table wherever it happened to go , and never moved it again until she put it on the stairs .
The person I had seen in pattens , who I suppose to have been the cook , frequently came and <unk> with her at the door , and there appeared to be ill will between them .
All through dinner — which was long , in consequence of such <unk> as the dish of potatoes being <unk> in the coal <unk> and the handle of the <unk> coming off and striking the young woman in the chin — Mrs.
Jellyby preserved the <unk> of her disposition .
She told us a great deal that was interesting about Borrioboola-Gha and the natives , and received so many letters that Richard , who sat by her , saw four <unk> in the gravy at once .
Some of the letters were proceedings of ladies ’ committees or <unk> of ladies ’ <unk> , which she read to us ; others were <unk> from people excited in various ways about the <unk> of coffee , and natives ; others required answers , and these she sent her eldest daughter from the table three or four times to write .
She was full of business and undoubtedly was , as she had told us , devoted to the cause .
I was a little curious to know who a mild bald gentleman in spectacles was , who dropped into a vacant chair ( there was no top or bottom in particular ) after the fish was taken away and seemed <unk> to submit himself to Borrioboola-Gha but not to be <unk> interested in that settlement .
As he never spoke a word , he might have been a native but for his complexion .
It was not until we left the table and he remained alone with Richard that the possibility of his being Mr. Jellyby ever entered my head .
But he WAS Mr. Jellyby ; and a <unk> young man called Mr. Quale , with large shining knobs for temples and his hair all brushed to the back of his head , who came in the evening , and told Ada he was a <unk> , also informed her that he called the <unk> <unk> of Mrs. Jellyby with Mr. Jellyby the <unk> of mind and matter .
This young man , besides having a great deal to say for himself about Africa and a project of his for teaching the coffee <unk> to teach the natives to turn <unk> legs and establish an <unk> trade , delighted in drawing Mrs. Jellyby out by saying , “ I believe now , Mrs. Jellyby , you have received as many as from one hundred and fifty to two hundred letters respecting Africa in a single day , have you not ? ” or , “ If my memory does not deceive me , Mrs. Jellyby , you once mentioned that you had sent off five thousand <unk> from one post-office at one time ? ” — always repeating Mrs. Jellyby ’ s answer to us like an <unk> .
During the whole evening , Mr. Jellyby sat in a corner with his head against the wall as if he were subject to low spirits .
It seemed that he had several times opened his mouth when alone with Richard after dinner , as if he had something on his mind , but had always shut it again , to Richard ’ s extreme confusion , without saying anything .
Mrs. Jellyby , sitting in quite a <unk> of waste paper , <unk> coffee all the evening and <unk> at intervals to her eldest daughter .
She also held a <unk> with Mr. Quale , of which the subject seemed to be — if I understood it — the <unk> of humanity , and gave utterance to some beautiful sentiments .
I was not so attentive an <unk> as I might have wished to be , however , for Peepy and the other children came <unk> about Ada and me in a corner of the drawing-room to ask for another story ; so we sat down among them and told them in whispers “ <unk> in <unk> ” and I don ’ t know what else until Mrs. Jellyby , accidentally remembering them , sent them to bed .
As Peepy cried for me to take him to bed , I carried him upstairs , where the young woman with the <unk> <unk> charged into the midst of the little family like a dragon and <unk> them into <unk> .
After that I occupied myself in making our room a little tidy and in <unk> a very cross fire that had been lighted to burn , which at last it did , quite brightly .
On my return downstairs , I felt that Mrs. Jellyby looked down upon me rather for being so <unk> , and I was sorry for it , though at the same time I knew that I had no higher pretensions .
It was nearly midnight before we found an opportunity of going to bed , and even then we left Mrs. Jellyby among her papers drinking coffee and Miss Jellyby biting the <unk> of her pen .
“ What a strange house ! ” said Ada when we got upstairs .
“ How curious of my cousin Jarndyce to send us here ! ” “ My love , ” said I , “ it quite <unk> me .
I want to understand it , and I can ’ t understand it at all . ” “ What ? ” asked Ada with her pretty smile .
“ All this , my dear , ” said I.
“ It MUST be very good of Mrs. Jellyby to take such pains about a scheme for the <unk> of natives — and yet — Peepy and the housekeeping ! ” Ada laughed and put her arm about my neck as I stood looking at the fire , and told me I was a quiet , dear , good creature and had won her heart .
“ You are so thoughtful , Esther , ” she said , “ and yet so cheerful !
And you do so much , so <unk> !
You would make a home out of even this house . ” My simple darling !
She was quite unconscious that she only praised herself and that it was in the goodness of her own heart that she made so much of me !
“ May I ask you a question ? ” said I when we had sat before the fire a little while .
“ <unk> hundred , ” said Ada .
“ Your cousin , Mr. Jarndyce .
I owe so much to him .
Would you mind <unk> him to me ? ” <unk> her golden hair , Ada turned her eyes upon me with such laughing wonder that I was full of wonder too , partly at her beauty , partly at her surprise .
“ Esther ! ” she cried .
“ My dear ! ” “ You want a description of my cousin Jarndyce ? ” “ My dear , I never saw him . ” “ And I never saw him ! ” returned Ada .
Well , to be sure !
No , she had never seen him .
Young as she was when her mama died , she remembered how the tears would come into her eyes when she spoke of him and of the noble generosity of his character , which she had said was to be trusted above all earthly things ; and Ada trusted it .
Her cousin Jarndyce had written to her a few months ago — “ a plain , honest letter , ” Ada said — proposing the arrangement we were now to enter on and telling her that “ in time it might <unk> some of the <unk> made by the miserable Chancery suit . ” She had replied , <unk> <unk> his proposal .
Richard had received a similar letter and had made a similar <unk> .
He HAD seen Mr. Jarndyce once , but only once , five years ago , at <unk> school .
He had told Ada , when they were leaning on the screen before the fire where I found them , that he <unk> him as “ a <unk> , rosy fellow . ” This was the utmost description Ada could give me .
It set me thinking so that when Ada was asleep , I still remained before the fire , wondering and wondering about Bleak House , and wondering and wondering that yesterday morning should seem so long ago .
I don ’ t know where my thoughts had wandered when they were recalled by a tap at the door .
I opened it softly and found Miss Jellyby shivering there with a broken candle in a broken <unk> in one hand and an <unk> in the other .
“ Good night ! ” she said very <unk> .
“ Good night ! ” said I.
“ May I come in ? ” she shortly and unexpectedly asked me in the same sulky way .
“ Certainly , ” said I.
“ Don ’ t wake Miss Clare . ” She would not sit down , but stood by the fire <unk> her inky middle finger in the <unk> , which contained <unk> , and <unk> it over the ink <unk> on her face , frowning the whole time and looking very gloomy .
“ I wish Africa was dead ! ” she said on a sudden .
I was going to <unk> .
“ I do ! ” she said “ Don ’ t talk to me , Miss Summerson .
I <unk> it and <unk> it .
It ’ s a <unk> ! ” I told her she was tired , and I was sorry .
I put my hand upon her head , and touched her forehead , and said it was hot now but would be cool to-morrow .
She still stood <unk> and frowning at me , but presently put down her <unk> and turned softly towards the bed where Ada lay .
“ She is very pretty ! ” she said with the same <unk> brow and in the same <unk> manner .
I assented with a smile .
“ An orphan .
Ain ’ t she ? ” “ Yes . ” “ But knows a quantity , I suppose ?
Can dance , and play music , and sing ?
She can talk French , I suppose , and do <unk> , and <unk> , and needlework , and everything ? ” “ No doubt , ” said I.
“ I can ’ t , ” she returned .
“ I can ’ t do anything hardly , except write .
I ’ m always writing for Ma .
I wonder you two were not ashamed of yourselves to come in this afternoon and see me able to do nothing else .
It was like your ill nature .
Yet you think yourselves very fine , I dare say ! ” I could see that the poor girl was near crying , and I resumed my chair without speaking and looked at her ( I hope ) as mildly as I felt towards her .
“ It ’ s disgraceful , ” she said .
“ You know it is .
The whole house is disgraceful .
The children are disgraceful .
I ’ M disgraceful .
Pa ’ s miserable , and no wonder !
<unk> drinks — she ’ s always drinking .
It ’ s a great shame and a great story of you if you say you didn ’ t smell her to-day .
It was as bad as a public-house , waiting at dinner ; you know it was ! ” “ My dear , I don ’ t know it , ” said I.
“ You do , ” she said very shortly .
“ You <unk> ’ t say you don ’ t .
You do ! ” “ Oh , my dear ! ” said I.
“ If you won ’ t let me speak — ” “ You ’ re speaking now .
You know you are .
Don ’ t tell stories , Miss Summerson . ” “ My dear , ” said I , “ as long as you won ’ t hear me out — ” “ I don ’ t want to hear you out . ” “ Oh , yes , I think you do , ” said I , “ because that would be so very unreasonable .
I did not know what you tell me because the servant did not come near me at dinner ; but I don ’ t doubt what you tell me , and I am sorry to hear it . ” “ You needn ’ t make a merit of that , ” said she .
“ No , my dear , ” said I.
“ That would be very foolish . ” She was still standing by the bed , and now stooped down ( but still with the same <unk> face ) and kissed Ada .
That done , she came softly back and stood by the side of my chair .
Her bosom was <unk> in a <unk> manner that I greatly pitied , but I thought it better not to speak .
“ I wish I was dead ! ” she broke out .
“ I wish we were all dead .
It would be a great deal better for us . ” In a moment afterwards , she <unk> on the ground at my side , hid her face in my dress , <unk> begged my pardon , and wept .
I <unk> her and would have raised her , but she cried no , no ; she wanted to stay there !
“ You used to teach girls , ” she said , “ If you could only have taught me , I could have learnt from you !
I am so very miserable , and I like you so much ! ” I could not persuade her to sit by me or to do anything but move a ragged stool to where she was <unk> , and take that , and still hold my dress in the same manner .
By degrees the poor tired girl fell asleep , and then I <unk> to raise her head so that it should rest on my lap , and to cover us both with <unk> .
The fire went out , and all night long she <unk> thus before the <unk> grate .
At first I was <unk> awake and <unk> tried to lose myself , with my eyes closed , among the <unk> of the day .
At length , by slow degrees , they became indistinct and mingled .
I began to lose the <unk> of the <unk> resting on me .
Now it was Ada , now one of my old Reading friends from whom I could not believe I had so recently parted .
Now it was the little mad woman worn out with <unk> and smiling , now some one in authority at Bleak House .
<unk> , it was no one , and I was no one .
