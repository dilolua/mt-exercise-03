I ’ m away to Lincolnshire to bring that old lady here . ” “ But , bless the woman , ” cried my guardian with his hand in his pocket , “ how is she going ?
What money has she got ? ” Mrs. Bagnet made another application to her skirts and brought forth a <unk> purse in which she hastily counted over a few shillings and which she then shut up with perfect satisfaction .
“ Never you mind for me , miss .
I ’ m a soldier ’ s wife and accustomed to travel my own way .
Lignum , old boy , ” kissing him , “ one for yourself , three for the children .
Now I ’ m away into Lincolnshire after George ’ s mother ! ” And she actually set off while we three stood looking at one another lost in amazement .
She actually <unk> away in her grey cloak at a <unk> pace , and turned the corner , and was gone .
“ Mr.
Bagnet , ” said my guardian .
“ Do you mean to let her go in that way ? ” “ Can ’ t help it , ” he returned .
“ <unk> her way home once from another quarter of the world .
With the same grey cloak .
And same umbrella .
Whatever the old girl says , do .
Do it !
Whenever the old girl says , I ’ <unk> do it .
She does it . ” “ Then she is as honest and genuine as she looks , ” rejoined my guardian , “ and it is impossible to say more for her . ” “ She ’ s <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , ” said Mr. Bagnet , looking at us over his shoulder as he went his way also .
“ And there ’ s not such another .
But I never own to it before her .
Discipline must be maintained . ” CHAPTER <unk> The <unk> Mr. Bucket and his fat forefinger are much in <unk> together under <unk> circumstances .
When Mr. Bucket has a matter of this pressing interest under his consideration , the fat forefinger seems to rise , to the dignity of a familiar demon .
He puts it to his ears , and it whispers information ; he puts it to his lips , and it <unk> him to secrecy ; he rubs it over his nose , and it <unk> his <unk> ; he shakes it before a guilty man , and it charms him to his <unk> .
The <unk> of the Detective Temple invariably <unk> that when Mr. Bucket and that finger are in much conference , a terrible <unk> will be heard of before long .
<unk> mildly <unk> in his observation of human nature , on the whole a benignant <unk> not disposed to be severe upon the <unk> of mankind , Mr. Bucket <unk> a vast number of houses and <unk> about an <unk> of streets , to outward appearance rather <unk> for want of an object .
He is in the <unk> condition towards his species and will drink with most of them .
He is free with his money , affable in his manners , innocent in his conversation — but through the placid stream of his life there glides an <unk> of forefinger .
Time and place cannot <unk> Mr. Bucket .
Like man in the <unk> , he is here to-day and gone to-morrow — but , very unlike man indeed , he is here again the next day .
This evening he will be casually looking into the iron <unk> at the door of Sir Leicester Dedlock ’ s house in town ; and to-morrow morning he will be walking on the leads at Chesney Wold , where <unk> the old man walked whose ghost is <unk> with a hundred guineas .
<unk> , <unk> , pockets , all things belonging to him , Mr. Bucket examines .
A few hours afterwards , he and the Roman will be alone together <unk> <unk> .
It is likely that these <unk> are <unk> with home enjoyment , but it is certain that Mr. Bucket at present does not go home .
Though in general he highly <unk> the society of Mrs. Bucket — a lady of a natural <unk> <unk> , which if it had been improved by professional exercise , might have done great things , but which has <unk> at the level of a clever amateur — he holds himself <unk> from that dear <unk> .
Mrs. Bucket is dependent on their lodger ( <unk> an amiable lady in whom she takes an interest ) for <unk> and conversation .
A great crowd <unk> in Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields on the day of the funeral .
Sir Leicester Dedlock <unk> the ceremony in person ; strictly speaking , there are only three other human followers , that is to say , Lord Doodle , William Buffy , and the debilitated cousin ( thrown in as a <unk> ) , but the amount of <unk> carriages is immense .
The peerage <unk> more <unk> affliction than has ever been seen in that neighbourhood .
Such is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on coach <unk> that the <unk> ’ s <unk> might be supposed to have lost its father and mother at a blow .
The <unk> of <unk> sends a <unk> pile of dust and ashes , with silver <unk> , <unk> <unk> , all the last <unk> , and three <unk> <unk> , six feet high , holding on behind , in a bunch of <unk> .
All the state <unk> in London seem <unk> into mourning ; and if that dead old man of the rusty <unk> be not beyond a taste in <unk> ( which appears impossible ) , it must be highly gratified this day .
<unk> among the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of so many legs all <unk> in grief , Mr. Bucket sits <unk> in one of the <unk> carriages and at his ease <unk> the crowd through the <unk> <unk> .
He has a keen eye for a crowd — as for what not ? — and looking here and there , now from this side of the carriage , now from the other , now up at the house windows , now along the people ’ s heads , nothing <unk> him .
“ And there you are , my partner , eh ? ” says Mr. Bucket to himself , <unk> Mrs. Bucket , <unk> , by his favour , on the steps of the deceased ’ s house .
“ And so you are .
And so you are !
And very well indeed you are looking , Mrs. Bucket ! ” The procession has not started yet , but is waiting for the cause of its <unk> to be brought out .
Mr. Bucket , in the foremost <unk> carriage , uses his two fat <unk> to hold the <unk> a hair ’ s breadth open while he looks .
And it says a great deal for his attachment , as a husband , that he is still occupied with Mrs. <unk>
“ There you are , my partner , eh ? ” he <unk> repeats .
“ And our lodger with you .
I ’ m taking notice of you , Mrs. Bucket ; I hope you ’ re all right in your health , my dear ! ” Not another word does Mr. Bucket say , but sits with most attentive eyes until the <unk> <unk> of noble secrets is brought down — Where are all those secrets now ?
Does he keep them yet ?
Did they fly with him on that sudden journey ? — and until the procession moves , and Mr. Bucket ’ s view is changed .
After which he <unk> himself for an easy ride and takes note of the <unk> of the carriage in case he should ever find such knowledge useful .
<unk> enough between Mr. Tulkinghorn shut up in his dark carriage and Mr. Bucket shut up in HIS .
Between the <unk> track of space beyond the little wound that has thrown the one into the fixed sleep which <unk> so heavily over the stones of the streets , and the narrow track of blood which keeps the other in the watchful state expressed in every hair of his head !
But it is all one to both ; neither is troubled about that .
Mr. Bucket sits out the procession in his own easy manner and glides from the carriage when the opportunity he has settled with himself arrives .
He makes for Sir Leicester Dedlock ’ s , which is at present a sort of home to him , where he comes and goes as he likes at all hours , where he is always welcome and made much of , where he knows the whole establishment , and walks in an atmosphere of mysterious greatness .
No knocking or ringing for Mr. Bucket .
He has caused himself to be provided with a key and can pass in at his pleasure .
As he is crossing the hall , Mercury informs him , “ Here ’ s another letter for you , Mr. Bucket , come by post , ” and gives it him .
“ Another one , eh ? ” says Mr. Bucket .
If Mercury should chance to be possessed by any lingering curiosity as to Mr. Bucket ’ s letters , that <unk> person is not the man to <unk> it .
Mr. Bucket looks at him as if his face were a <unk> of some miles in length and he were leisurely contemplating the same .
“ Do you happen to carry a box ? ” says Mr. Bucket .
<unk> Mercury is no <unk> .
“ Could you fetch me a pinch from <unk> ? ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Thankee .
It don ’ t matter what it is ; I ’ m not particular as to the kind .
Thankee ! ” Having leisurely helped himself from a <unk> borrowed from somebody downstairs for the purpose , and having made a considerable show of <unk> it , first with one side of his nose and then with the other , Mr. Bucket , with much <unk> , <unk> it of the right sort and goes on , letter in hand .
Now although Mr. Bucket walks upstairs to the little library within the larger one with the face of a man who receives some scores of letters every day , it happens that much correspondence is not <unk> to his life .
He is no great <unk> , rather <unk> his pen like the <unk> he carries about with him always convenient to his <unk> , and <unk> correspondence with himself in others as being too <unk> and direct a way of doing delicate business .
<unk> , he often sees <unk> letters produced in evidence and has occasion to reflect that it was a green thing to write them .
For these reasons he has very little to do with letters , either as <unk> or <unk> .
And yet he has received a round <unk> within the last <unk> hours .
“ And this , ” says Mr. Bucket , <unk> it out on the table , “ is in the same hand , and <unk> of the same two words . ” What two words ?
He turns the key in the door , <unk> his black <unk> ( book of fate to many ) , lays another letter by it , and reads , <unk> written in each , “ Lady Dedlock . ” “ Yes , yes , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ But I could have made the money without this <unk> information . ” Having put the letters in his book of fate and <unk> it up again , he unlocks the door just in time to admit his dinner , which is brought upon a goodly tray with a <unk> of <unk> .
Mr. Bucket frequently observes , in friendly circles where there is no <unk> , that he likes a <unk> of your fine old brown <unk> <unk> <unk> better than anything you can offer him .
Consequently he fills and <unk> his glass with a <unk> of his lips and is proceeding with his refreshment when an idea enters his mind .
Mr. Bucket softly opens the door of communication between that room and the next and looks in .
The library is deserted , and the fire is sinking low .
Mr. Bucket ’ s eye , after taking a <unk> round the room , alights upon a table where letters are usually put as they <unk> .
Several letters for Sir Leicester are upon it .
Mr. Bucket draws near and examines the directions .
“ No , ” he says , “ there ’ s none in that hand .
It ’ s only me as is written to .
I can break it to Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , to-morrow . ” With that he returns to finish his dinner with a good appetite , and after a light <unk> , is <unk> into the drawing-room .
Sir Leicester has received him there these several evenings past to know whether he has anything to report .
The debilitated cousin ( much exhausted by the funeral ) and Volumnia are in attendance .
Mr. Bucket makes three distinctly different bows to these three people .
A bow of homage to Sir Leicester , a bow of gallantry to Volumnia , and a bow of recognition to the debilitated Cousin , to whom it <unk> says , “ You are a swell about town , and you know me , and I know you . ” Having distributed these little specimens of his tact , Mr. Bucket rubs his hands .
“ Have you anything new to communicate , officer ? ” inquires Sir Leicester .
“ Do you wish to hold any conversation with me in private ? ” “ Why — not to-night , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . ” “ Because my time , ” pursues Sir Leicester , “ is wholly at your disposal with a view to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the law . ” Mr. Bucket coughs and glances at Volumnia , <unk> and <unk> , as though he would respectfully observe , “ I do assure you , you ’ re a pretty <unk> .
I ’ ve seen hundreds worse looking at your time of life , I have indeed . ” The fair Volumnia , not quite unconscious perhaps of the <unk> influence of her charms , pauses in the writing of <unk> notes and <unk> adjusts the pearl necklace .
Mr. Bucket <unk> that <unk> in his mind and thinks it as likely as not that Volumnia is writing poetry .
“ If I have not , ” pursues Sir Leicester , “ in the most emphatic manner , <unk> you , officer , to exercise your utmost skill in this <unk> case , I particularly desire to take the present opportunity of <unk> any <unk> I may have made .
Let no expense be a consideration .
I am prepared to <unk> all charges .
You can <unk> none in pursuit of the object you have <unk> that I shall <unk> for a moment to bear . ” Mr. Bucket made Sir Leicester ’ s bow again as a <unk> to this <unk> .
“ My mind , ” Sir Leicester adds with a generous warmth , “ has not , as may be easily supposed , recovered its tone since the late <unk> occurrence .
It is not likely ever to recover its tone .
But it is full of indignation to-night after <unk> the <unk> of <unk> to the <unk> the remains of a faithful , a zealous , a devoted <unk> . ” Sir Leicester ’ s voice <unk> and his grey hair stirs upon his head .
<unk> are in his eyes ; the best part of his nature is aroused .
“ I declare , ” he says , “ I solemnly declare that until this crime is discovered and , in the course of justice , punished , I almost feel as if there were a <unk> upon my name .
A gentleman who has devoted a large portion of his life to me , a gentleman who has devoted the last day of his life to me , a gentleman who has constantly sat at my table and slept under my roof , goes from my house to his own , and is struck down within an hour of his leaving my house .
I cannot say but that he may have been followed from my house , watched at my house , even first marked because of his association with my house — which may have suggested his possessing greater wealth and being altogether of greater importance than his own retiring <unk> would have <unk> .
If I cannot with my means and influence and my position bring all the <unk> of such a crime to light , I fail in the <unk> of my respect for that gentleman ’ s memory and of my fidelity towards one who was ever faithful to me . ” While he makes this <unk> with great emotion and earnestness , looking round the room as if he were addressing an <unk> , Mr. Bucket glances at him with an observant gravity in which there might be , but for the <unk> of the thought , a touch of compassion .
“ The ceremony of to-day , ” continues Sir Leicester , “ <unk> <unk> of the respect in which my deceased friend ” — he lays a <unk> upon the word , for death <unk> all <unk> — “ was held by the flower of the land , has , I say , <unk> the shock I have received from this most horrible and <unk> crime .
If it were my brother who had committed it , I would not spare him . ” Mr. Bucket looks very grave .
Volumnia remarks of the deceased that he was the <unk> and dearest person !
“ You must feel it as a <unk> to you , miss , ” replies Mr. Bucket <unk> , “ no doubt .
He was calculated to BE a <unk> , I ’ m sure he was . ” Volumnia gives Mr. Bucket to understand , in reply , that her sensitive mind is fully made up never to get the better of it as long as she lives , that her <unk> are <unk> for ever , and that she has not the least expectation of ever smiling again .
Meanwhile she folds up a <unk> hat for that <unk> old general at Bath , <unk> of her melancholy condition .
“ It gives a start to a delicate female , ” says Mr. Bucket <unk> , “ but it ’ ll wear off . ” Volumnia wishes of all things to know what is doing ?
Whether they are going to <unk> , or whatever it is , that dreadful soldier ?
Whether he had any <unk> , or whatever the thing is called in the law ?
And a great deal more to the like <unk> purpose .
“ Why you see , miss , ” returns Mr. Bucket , bringing the finger into <unk> action — and such is his natural gallantry that he had almost said “ my dear ” — “ it ain ’ t easy to answer those questions at the present moment .
Not at the present moment .
I ’ ve kept myself on this case , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ” whom Mr. Bucket takes into the conversation in right of his importance , “ morning , noon , and night .
But for a glass or two of <unk> , I don ’ t think I could have had my mind so much upon the stretch as it has been .
I <unk> answer your questions , miss , but duty <unk> it .
Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , will very soon be made acquainted with all that has been <unk> .
And I hope that he may find it ” — Mr.
Bucket again looks grave — “ to his satisfaction . ” The debilitated cousin only hopes some fler ’ ll be executed — <unk> .
<unk> more interest ’ s wanted — get man hanged <unk> — than get man place ten thousand a year .
<unk> ’ t a doubt — <unk> — far better hang wrong fler than no fler .
“ YOU know life , you know , sir , ” says Mr. Bucket with a <unk> <unk> of his eye and crook of his finger , “ and you can confirm what I ’ ve mentioned to this lady .
YOU don ’ t want to be told that from information I have received I have gone to work .
You ’ re up to what a lady can ’ t be expected to be up to .
Lord !
<unk> in your elevated station of society , miss , ” says Mr. Bucket , quite reddening at another narrow escape from “ my dear . ” “ The officer , Volumnia , ” observes Sir Leicester , “ is faithful to his duty , and perfectly right . ” Mr. Bucket murmurs , “ Glad to have the honour of your <unk> , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . ” “ In fact , Volumnia , ” proceeds Sir Leicester , “ it is not holding up a good model for imitation to ask the officer any such questions as you have put to him .
He is the best judge of his own responsibility ; he <unk> upon his responsibility .
And it does not become us , who assist in making the laws , to <unk> or <unk> with those who carry them into <unk> .
Or , ” says Sir Leicester somewhat sternly , for Volumnia was going to cut in before he had <unk> his sentence , “ or who <unk> their <unk> <unk> . ” Volumnia with all humility explains that she had not merely the <unk> of curiosity to <unk> ( in common with the giddy youth of her sex in general ) but that she is perfectly dying with regret and interest for the darling man whose loss they all <unk> .
“ Very well , Volumnia , ” returns Sir Leicester .
“ Then you cannot be too <unk> . ” Mr. Bucket takes the opportunity of a pause to be heard again .
“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I have no objections to telling this lady , with your leave and among ourselves , that I look upon the case as pretty well complete .
It is a beautiful case — a beautiful case — and what little is wanting to complete it , I expect to be able to <unk> in a few hours . ” “ I am very glad indeed to hear it , ” says Sir Leicester .
“ <unk> <unk> to you . ” “ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ” returns Mr. Bucket very seriously , “ I hope it may at one and the same time do me credit and prove satisfactory to all .
When I <unk> it as a beautiful case , you see , miss , ” Mr. Bucket goes on , glancing gravely at Sir Leicester , “ I mean from my point of view .
As considered from other points of view , such cases will always involve more or less <unk> .
Very strange things comes to our knowledge in families , miss ; bless your heart , what you would think to be <unk> , quite . ” Volumnia , with her innocent little scream , supposes so .
“ Aye , and even in <unk> families , in high families , in great families , ” says Mr. Bucket , again gravely eyeing Sir Leicester aside .
“ I have had the honour of being employed in high families before , and you have no idea — come , I ’ ll go so far as to say not even YOU have any idea , sir , ” this to the debilitated cousin , “ what games goes on ! ” The cousin , who has been casting <unk> on his head , in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , “ <unk> , ” being the <unk> for “ very likely . ” Sir Leicester , <unk> it time to dismiss the officer , here majestically interposes with the words , “ Very good .
Thank you ! ” and also with a wave of his hand , <unk> not only that there is an end of the discourse , but that if high families fall into low habits they must take the consequences .
“ You will not forget , officer , ” he adds with condescension , “ that I am at your disposal when you please . ” Mr. Bucket ( still grave ) inquires if to-morrow morning , now , would suit , in case he should be as for ’ ard as he <unk> to be .
Sir Leicester replies , “ All times are alike to me . ” Mr. Bucket makes his three bows and is withdrawing when a forgotten point <unk> to him .
“ Might I ask , by the by , ” he says in a low voice , <unk> returning , “ who posted the <unk> on the staircase . ” “ I <unk> it to be put up there , ” replies Sir Leicester .
“ Would it be considered a liberty , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , if I was to ask you why ? ” “ Not at all .
I <unk> it as a <unk> part of the house .
I think it cannot be too <unk> kept before the whole establishment .
I wish my people to be impressed with the <unk> of the crime , the determination to <unk> it , and the <unk> of escape .
At the same time , officer , if you in your better knowledge of the subject see any objection — ” Mr. Bucket sees none now ; the bill having been put up , had better not be taken down .
<unk> his three bows he withdraws , closing the door on Volumnia ’ s little scream , which is a <unk> to her <unk> that that <unk> horrible person is a perfect <unk> <unk> .
In his <unk> for society and his <unk> to all <unk> , Mr. Bucket is presently standing before the <unk> — bright and warm on the early winter night — admiring Mercury .
“ Why , you ’ re six foot two , I suppose ? ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Three , ” says Mercury .
“ Are you so much ?
But then , you see , you ’ re broad in <unk> and don ’ t look it .
You ’ re not one of the <unk> ones , you ain ’ t .
Was you ever <unk> now ? ” Mr. Bucket asks , <unk> the expression of an artist into the turn of his eye and head .
Mercury never was <unk> .
“ Then you ought to be , you know , ” says Mr. Bucket ; “ and a friend of mine that you ’ ll hear of one day as a Royal <unk> <unk> would stand something handsome to make a drawing of your proportions for the <unk> .
My Lady ’ s out , ain ’ t she ? ” “ Out to dinner . ” “ <unk> out pretty well every day , don ’ t she ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Not to be wondered at ! ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Such a fine woman as her , so handsome and so graceful and so elegant , is like a fresh <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> wherever she goes .
Was your father in the same way of life as yourself ? ” Answer in the <unk> .
“ Mine was , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ My father was first a page , then a <unk> , then a <unk> , then a steward , then an <unk> .
<unk> universally respected , and died <unk> .
<unk> with his last breath that he considered service the most honourable part of his career , and so it was .
I ’ ve a brother in service , AND a <unk> .
My Lady a good temper ? ” Mercury replies , “ As good as you can expect . ” “ Ah ! ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ A little <unk> ?
A little <unk> ?
Lord !
What can you <unk> when they ’ re so handsome as that ?
And we like ’ em all the better for it , don ’ t we ? ” Mercury , with his hands in the pockets of his bright <unk> <unk> , stretches his <unk> silk legs with the air of a man of gallantry and can ’ t deny it .
Come the roll of wheels and a violent ringing at the bell .
“ <unk> of the angels , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Here she is ! ” The doors are thrown open , and she passes through the hall .
Still very pale , she is dressed in slight mourning and wears two beautiful <unk> .
<unk> their beauty or the beauty of her arms is particularly <unk> to Mr. Bucket .
He looks at them with an eager eye and rattles something in his pocket — halfpence perhaps .
<unk> him at his distance , she turns an <unk> look on the other Mercury who has brought her home .
“ Mr.
Bucket , my Lady . ” Mr. Bucket makes a leg and comes forward , passing his familiar demon over the region of his mouth .
“ Are you waiting to see Sir Leicester ? ” “ No , my Lady , I ’ ve seen him ! ” “ Have you anything to say to me ? ” “ Not just at present , my Lady . ” “ Have you made any new <unk> ? ” “ A few , my Lady . ” This is merely in passing .
She scarcely makes a stop , and sweeps upstairs alone .
Mr. Bucket , moving towards the <unk> , watches her as she goes up the steps the old man came down to his grave , past murderous groups of <unk> repeated with their shadowy weapons on the wall , past the printed bill , which she looks at going by , out of view .
“ She ’ s a lovely woman , too , she really is , ” says Mr. Bucket , coming back to Mercury .
“ Don ’ t look quite healthy though . ” Is not quite healthy , Mercury informs him .
<unk> much from <unk> .
Really ?
That ’ s a pity !
<unk> , Mr. Bucket would recommend for that .
Well , she tries walking , Mercury rejoins .
<unk> sometimes for two hours when she has them bad .
By night , too .
“ Are you sure you ’ re quite so much as six foot three ? ” asks Mr. Bucket .
“ <unk> your pardon for <unk> you a moment ? ” Not a doubt about it .
“ You ’ re so well put together that I shouldn ’ t have thought it .
But the household <unk> , though considered fine men , are built so <unk> .
<unk> by night , does she ?
When it ’ s moonlight , though ? ” Oh , yes .
When it ’ s moonlight !
Of course .
Oh , of course !
<unk> and <unk> on both sides .
“ I suppose you ain ’ t in the habit of walking yourself ? ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Not much time for it , I should say ? ” Besides which , Mercury don ’ t like it .
<unk> carriage exercise .
“ To be sure , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ That makes a difference .
Now I think of it , ” says Mr. Bucket , <unk> his hands and looking pleasantly at the blaze , “ she went out walking the very night of this business . ” “ To be sure she did !
I let her into the garden over the way . ” “ And left her there .
Certainly you did .
I saw you doing it . ” “ I didn ’ t see YOU , ” says Mercury .
“ I was rather in a hurry , ” returns Mr. Bucket , “ for I was going to visit a aunt of mine that lives at <unk> — next door but two to the old original <unk> House — <unk> year old the old lady is , a single woman , and got a little property .
Yes , I <unk> to be passing at the time .
Let ’ s see .
What time might it be ?
It wasn ’ t ten . ” “ <unk> nine . ” “ You ’ re right .
So it was .
And if I don ’ t deceive myself , my Lady was muffled in a loose black <unk> , with a deep <unk> to it ? ” “ Of course she was . ” Of course she was .
Mr. Bucket must return to a little work he has to get on with upstairs , but he must shake hands with Mercury in acknowledgment of his agreeable conversation , and will he — this is all he asks — will he , when he has a leisure half-hour , think of <unk> it on that Royal <unk> <unk> , for the advantage of both parties ?
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> a Mine <unk> by sleep , Mr. Bucket rises <unk> in the morning and prepares for a <unk> .
<unk> up by the aid of a clean <unk> and a wet <unk> , with which instrument , on occasions of ceremony , he <unk> such thin locks as remain to him after his life of severe study , Mr. Bucket lays in a breakfast of two mutton chops as a <unk> to work upon , together with tea , <unk> , toast , and <unk> on a <unk> scale .
Having much enjoyed these strengthening matters and having held <unk> conference with his familiar demon , he confidently <unk> Mercury “ just to mention quietly to Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , that whenever he ’ s ready for me , I ’ m ready for him . ” A gracious message being returned that Sir Leicester will <unk> his <unk> and join Mr. Bucket in the library within ten minutes , Mr. Bucket repairs to that apartment and stands before the fire with his finger on his chin , looking at the blazing <unk> .
<unk> Mr. Bucket is , as a man may be with <unk> work to do , but composed , sure , confident .
From the expression of his face he might be a famous <unk> for a large stake — say a hundred guineas certain — with the game in his hand , but with a high reputation involved in his playing his hand out to the last card in a masterly way .
Not in the least anxious or disturbed is Mr. Bucket when Sir Leicester appears , but he eyes the baronet aside as he comes slowly to his easy-chair with that observant gravity of yesterday in which there might have been yesterday , but for the <unk> of the idea , a touch of compassion .
“ I am sorry to have kept you waiting , officer , but I am rather later than my usual hour this morning .
I am not well .
The agitation and the indignation from which I have recently suffered have been too much for me .
I am subject to — gout ” — Sir Leicester was going to say <unk> and would have said it to anybody else , but Mr. Bucket <unk> knows all about it — “ and <unk> circumstances have brought it on . ” As he takes his seat with some difficulty and with an air of pain , Mr. Bucket draws a little nearer , standing with one of his large hands on the <unk> .
“ I am not aware , officer , ” Sir Leicester observes ; raising his eyes to his face , “ whether you wish us to be alone , but that is entirely as you please .
If you do , well and good .
If not , Miss Dedlock would be interested — ” “ Why , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ” returns Mr. Bucket with his head <unk> on one side and his forefinger <unk> at one ear like an <unk> , “ we can ’ t be too private just at present .
You will presently see that we can ’ t be too private .
A lady , under the circumstances , and especially in Miss Dedlock ’ s elevated station of society , can ’ t but be agreeable to me , but speaking without a view to myself , I will take the liberty of <unk> you that I know we can ’ t be too private . ” “ That is enough . ” “ So much so , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ” Mr. Bucket resumes , “ that I was on the point of asking your permission to turn the key in the door . ” “ By all means . ” Mr. Bucket <unk> and softly takes that precaution , stooping on his knee for a moment from mere force of habit so to <unk> the key in the lock as that no one shall peep in from the <unk> .
“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I mentioned yesterday evening that I wanted but a very little to complete this case .
I have now completed it and collected proof against the person who did this crime . ” “ <unk> the soldier ? ” “ No , Sir Leicester Dedlock ; not the soldier . ” Sir Leicester looks <unk> and inquires , “ Is the man in custody ? ” Mr. Bucket tells him , after a pause , “ It was a woman . ” Sir Leicester leans back in his chair , and <unk> <unk> , “ Good heaven ! ” “ Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ” Mr. Bucket begins , standing over him with one hand spread out on the <unk> and the forefinger of the other in impressive use , “ it ’ s my duty to prepare you for a train of circumstances that may , and I go so far as to say that will , give you a shock .
But Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , you are a gentleman , and I know what a gentleman is and what a gentleman is capable of .
A gentleman can bear a shock when it must come , <unk> and steadily .
A gentleman can make up his mind to stand up against almost any blow .
Why , take yourself , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet .
If there ’ s a blow to be <unk> on you , you naturally think of your family .
You ask yourself , how would all them <unk> of yours , away to <unk> <unk> — not to go beyond him at present — have borne that blow ; you remember scores of them that would have borne it well ; and you bear it well on their accounts , and to maintain the family credit .
That ’ s the way you <unk> , and that ’ s the way you act , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . ” Sir Leicester , leaning back in his chair and <unk> the elbows , sits looking at him with a <unk> face .
“ Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , ” proceeds Mr. Bucket , “ thus preparing you , let me beg of you not to trouble your mind for a moment as to anything having come to MY knowledge .
I know so much about so many <unk> , high and low , that a piece of information more or less don ’ t <unk> a straw .
I don ’ t suppose there ’ s a move on the board that would surprise ME , and as to this or that move having taken place , why my knowing it is no odds at all , any possible move whatever ( provided it ’ s in a wrong direction ) being a probable move according to my experience .
Therefore , what I say to you , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , is , don ’ t you go and let yourself be put out of the way because of my knowing anything of your family affairs . ” “ I thank you for your preparation , ” returns Sir Leicester after a silence , without moving hand , foot , or feature , “ which I hope is not necessary ; though I give it credit for being well intended .
Be so good as to go on .
Also ” — Sir Leicester seems to <unk> in the shadow of his figure — “ also , to take a seat , if you have no objection . ” None at all .
Mr. Bucket brings a chair and <unk> his shadow .
“ Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , with this short <unk> I come to the point .
Lady Dedlock — ” Sir Leicester <unk> himself in his seat and stares at him <unk> .
Mr. Bucket brings the finger into play as an <unk> .
“ Lady Dedlock , you see she ’ s universally admired .
That ’ s what her ladyship is ; she ’ s universally admired , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ I would greatly prefer , officer , ” Sir Leicester returns <unk> , “ my Lady ’ s name being entirely <unk> from this <unk> . ” “ So would I , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , but — it ’ s impossible . ” “ <unk> ? ” Mr. Bucket shakes his <unk> head .
“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , it ’ s altogether impossible .
What I have got to say is about her ladyship .
She is the <unk> it all turns on . ” “ <unk> , ” retorts Sir Leicester with a fiery eye and a <unk> lip , “ you know your duty .
Do your duty , but be careful not to <unk> it .
I would not suffer it .
I would not <unk> it .
You bring my Lady ’ s name into this communication upon your responsibility — upon your responsibility .
My Lady ’ s name is not a name for common persons to trifle with ! ” “ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I say what I must say , and no more . ” “ I hope it may prove so .
Very well .
Go on .
Go on , sir ! ” <unk> at the angry eyes which now avoid him and at the angry figure trembling from head to foot , yet striving to be still , Mr. Bucket feels his way with his forefinger and in a low voice proceeds .
“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , it becomes my duty to tell you that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn long entertained <unk> and suspicions of Lady Dedlock . ” “ If he had dared to breathe them to me , sir — which he never did — I would have killed him myself ! ” exclaims Sir Leicester , striking his hand upon the table .
But in the very heat and <unk> of the act he stops , fixed by the knowing eyes of Mr. Bucket , whose forefinger is slowly going and who , with mingled confidence and patience , shakes his head .
“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn was deep and close , and what he fully had in his mind in the very beginning I can ’ t quite take upon myself to say .
But I know from his lips that he long ago suspected Lady Dedlock of having discovered , through the sight of some handwriting — in this very house , and when you yourself , Sir Leicester Dedlock , were present — the existence , in great <unk> , of a certain person who had been her lover before you <unk> her and who ought to have been her husband . ” Mr. Bucket stops and deliberately repeats , “ <unk> to have been her husband , not a doubt about it .
I know from his lips that when that person soon afterwards died , he suspected Lady Dedlock of <unk> his wretched lodging and his wretched grave , alone and in secret .
I know from my own inquiries and through my eyes and ears that Lady Dedlock did make such visit in the dress of her own maid , for the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn employed me to <unk> up her ladyship — if you ’ ll excuse my making use of the term we <unk> employ — and I <unk> her up , so far , completely .
I <unk> the maid in the chambers in Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields with a witness who had been Lady Dedlock ’ s guide , and there couldn ’ t be the shadow of a doubt that she had worn the young woman ’ s dress , unknown to her .
Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I did endeavour to <unk> the way a little towards these unpleasant <unk> yesterday by saying that very strange things happened even in high families sometimes .
All this , and more , has happened in your own family , and to and through your own Lady .
It ’ s my belief that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn followed up these inquiries to the hour of his death and that he and Lady Dedlock even had bad blood between them upon the matter that very night .
Now , only you put that to Lady Dedlock , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and ask her ladyship whether , even after he had left here , she didn ’ t go down to his chambers with the intention of saying something further to him , dressed in a loose black <unk> with a deep <unk> to it . ” Sir Leicester sits like a <unk> , <unk> at the cruel finger that is <unk> the <unk> of his heart .
“ You put that to her ladyship , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , from me , Inspector Bucket of the Detective .
And if her ladyship makes any difficulty about <unk> of it , you tell her that it ’ s no use , that Inspector Bucket knows it and knows that she passed the soldier as you called him ( though he ’ s not in the army now ) and knows that she knows she passed him on the staircase .
Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , why do I relate all this ? ” Sir Leicester , who has covered his face with his hands , <unk> a single groan , <unk> him to pause for a moment .
By and by he takes his hands away , and so <unk> his dignity and outward calmness , though there is no more colour in his face than in his white hair , that Mr. Bucket is a little <unk> by him .
Something frozen and fixed is upon his manner , over and above its usual <unk> of <unk> , and Mr. Bucket soon <unk> an unusual <unk> in his speech , with now and then a curious trouble in beginning , which occasions him to utter <unk> sounds .
With such sounds he now breaks silence , soon , however , <unk> himself to say that he does not comprehend why a gentleman so faithful and zealous as the late Mr. Tulkinghorn should have communicated to him nothing of this painful , this <unk> , this <unk> , this <unk> , this <unk> intelligence .
“ Again , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ” returns Mr. Bucket , “ put it to her ladyship to clear that up .
Put it to her ladyship , if you think it right , from Inspector Bucket of the Detective .
You ’ ll find , or I ’ m much mistaken , that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn had the intention of communicating the whole to you as soon as he considered it <unk> , and further , that he had given her ladyship so to understand .
Why , he might have been going to <unk> it the very morning when I examined the body !
You don ’ t know what I ’ m going to say and do five minutes from this present time , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ; and supposing I was to be picked off now , you might wonder why I hadn ’ t done it , don ’ t you see ? ” True .
Sir Leicester , <unk> , with some trouble those <unk> sounds , says , “ True . ” At this <unk> a considerable noise of voices is heard in the hall .
Mr. Bucket , after listening , goes to the <unk> , softly unlocks and opens it , and listens again .
Then he draws in his head and whispers hurriedly but composedly , “ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , this unfortunate family affair has taken air , as I expected it might , the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn being cut down so sudden .
The chance to <unk> it is to let in these people now in a <unk> with your <unk> .
Would you mind sitting quiet — on the family account — while I <unk> ’ em up ?
And would you just throw in a nod when I seem to ask you for it ? ” Sir Leicester <unk> answers , “ <unk> .
The best you can , the best you can ! ” and Mr. Bucket , with a nod and a sagacious crook of the forefinger , <unk> down into the hall , where the voices quickly die away .
He is not long in returning ; a few paces <unk> of Mercury and a brother <unk> also <unk> and in <unk> <unk> , who bear between them a chair in which is an incapable old man .
Another man and two women come behind .
<unk> the <unk> of the chair in an affable and easy manner , Mr. Bucket <unk> the Mercuries and locks the door again .
Sir Leicester looks on at this <unk> of the sacred <unk> with an <unk> stare .
“ Now , perhaps you may know me , ladies and gentlemen , ” says Mr. Bucket in a confidential voice .
“ I am Inspector Bucket of the Detective , I am ; and this , ” producing the <unk> of his convenient little staff from his <unk> , “ is my authority .
Now , you wanted to see Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet .
Well !
You do see him , and mind you , it ain ’ t every one as is admitted to that honour .
Your name , old gentleman , is Smallweed ; that ’ s what your name is ; I know it well . ” “ Well , and you never heard any harm of it ! ” cries Mr. Smallweed in a shrill loud voice .
“ You don ’ t happen to know why they killed the pig , do you ? ” retorts Mr. Bucket with a <unk> look , but without loss of temper .
“ No ! ” “ Why , they killed him , ” says Mr. Bucket , “ on account of his having so much cheek .
Don ’ t YOU get into the same position , because it isn ’ t worthy of you .
You ain ’ t in the habit of <unk> with a deaf person , are you ? ” “ Yes , ” <unk> Mr. Smallweed , “ my wife ’ s deaf . ” “ That accounts for your <unk> your voice so high .
But as she ain ’ t here ; just pitch it an <unk> or two lower , will you , and I ’ ll not only be obliged to you , but it ’ ll do you more credit , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ This other gentleman is in the <unk> line , I think ? ” “ Name of Chadband , ” Mr. Smallweed puts in , speaking henceforth in a much lower key .
“ Once had a friend and brother <unk> of the same name , ” says Mr. Bucket , offering his hand , “ and consequently feel a liking for it .
Mrs. Chadband , no doubt ? ” “ And Mrs. Snagsby , ” Mr. Smallweed <unk> .
“ <unk> a law-stationer and a friend of my own , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ <unk> him like a brother !
Now , what ’ s up ? ” “ Do you mean what business have we come upon ? ” Mr. Smallweed asks , a little dashed by the <unk> of this turn .
“ Ah !
You know what I mean .
Let us hear what it ’ s all about in presence of Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet .
Come . ” Mr. Smallweed , <unk> Mr. Chadband , takes a moment ’ s counsel with him in a whisper .
Mr. Chadband , expressing a considerable amount of oil from the <unk> of his forehead and the <unk> of his hands , says aloud , “ Yes .
You first ! ” and retires to his former place .
“ I was the client and friend of Mr. Tulkinghorn , ” pipes Grandfather Smallweed then ; “ I did business with him .
I was useful to him , and he was useful to me .
Krook , dead and gone , was my <unk> .
He was own brother to a brimstone <unk> — <unk> Mrs. Smallweed .
I come into Krook ’ s property .
I examined all his papers and all his effects .
They was all <unk> out under my eyes .
There was a bundle of letters belonging to a dead and gone lodger as was hid away at the back of a shelf in the side of Lady Jane ’ s bed — his cat ’ s bed .
He hid all manner of things away , <unk> .
Mr. Tulkinghorn wanted ’ em and got ’ em , but I looked ’ em over first .
I ’ m a man of business , and I took a <unk> at ’ em .
They was letters from the lodger ’ s <unk> , and she <unk> <unk> .
Dear me , that ’ s not a common name , <unk> , is it ?
There ’ s no lady in this house that signs <unk> is there ?
Oh , no , I don ’ t think so !
Oh , no , I don ’ t think so !
And not in the same hand , perhaps ?
Oh , no , I don ’ t think so ! ” Here Mr. Smallweed , seized with a fit of coughing in the midst of his triumph , breaks off to <unk> , “ Oh , dear me !
Oh , Lord !
I ’ m shaken all to pieces ! ” “ Now , when you ’ re ready , ” says Mr. Bucket after <unk> his recovery , “ to come to anything that concerns Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , here the gentleman sits , you know . ” “ <unk> ’ t I come to it , Mr. Bucket ? ” cries Grandfather Smallweed .
“ <unk> ’ t the gentleman concerned yet ?
Not with Captain Hawdon , and his ever affectionate <unk> , and their child into the bargain ?
Come , then , I want to know where those letters are .
That concerns me , if it don ’ t concern Sir Leicester Dedlock .
I will know where they are .
I won ’ t have ’ em <unk> so quietly .
I handed ’ em over to my friend and solicitor , Mr. Tulkinghorn , not to anybody else . ” “ Why , he paid you for them , you know , and handsome too , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ I don ’ t care for that .
I want to know who ’ s got ’ em .
And I tell you what we want — what we all here want , Mr. Bucket .
We want more <unk> and <unk> into this murder .
We know where the interest and the <unk> was , and you have not done enough .
If George the vagabond <unk> had any hand in it , he was only an <unk> , and was set on .
You know what I mean as well as any man . ” “ Now I tell you what , ” says Mr. Bucket , <unk> <unk> his manner , coming close to him , and communicating an extraordinary fascination to the forefinger , “ I am <unk> if I am a-going to have my case <unk> , or <unk> with , or anticipated by so much as half a second of time by any human being in <unk> .
YOU want more <unk> and <unk> !
YOU do ?
Do you see this hand , and do you think that I don ’ t know the right time to stretch it out and put it on the arm that <unk> that shot ? ” Such is the dread power of the man , and so <unk> evident it is that he makes no idle boast , that Mr. Smallweed begins to <unk> .
Mr. Bucket , <unk> his sudden anger , checks him .
“ The advice I give you is , don ’ t you trouble your head about the murder .
That ’ s my affair .
You keep half an eye on the newspapers , and I shouldn ’ t wonder if you was to read something about it before long , if you look sharp .
I know my business , and that ’ s all I ’ ve got to say to you on that subject .
Now about those letters .
You want to know who ’ s got ’ em .
I don ’ t mind telling you .
I have got ’ em .
Is that the <unk> ? ” Mr. Smallweed looks , with <unk> eyes , at the little bundle Mr. Bucket produces from a mysterious part of his coat , and <unk> it as the same .
“ What have you got to say next ? ” asks Mr. Bucket .
“ Now , don ’ t open your mouth too wide , because you don ’ t look handsome when you do it . ” “ I want five hundred pound . ” “ No , you don ’ t ; you mean fifty , ” says Mr. Bucket <unk> .
It appears , however , that Mr. Smallweed means five hundred .
“ That is , I am <unk> by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , to consider ( without <unk> or promising anything ) this bit of business , ” says Mr. Bucket — Sir Leicester <unk> bows his head — “ and you ask me to consider a proposal of five hundred pounds .
Why , it ’ s an unreasonable proposal !
Two fifty would be bad enough , but better than that .
Hadn ’ t you better say two fifty ? ” Mr. Smallweed is quite clear that he had better not .
“ Then , ” says Mr. Bucket , “ let ’ s hear Mr. Chadband .
Lord !
Many a time I ’ ve heard my old <unk> of that name ; and a <unk> man he was in all respects , as ever I come across ! ” Thus invited , Mr. Chadband steps forth , and after a little <unk> smiling and a little <unk> with the <unk> of his hands , delivers himself as follows , “ My friends , we are now — Rachael , my wife , and I — in the <unk> of the rich and great .
Why are we now in the <unk> of the rich and great , my friends ?
Is it because we are invited ?
Because we are bidden to <unk> with them , because we are bidden to rejoice with them , because we are bidden to play the <unk> with them , because we are bidden to dance with them ?
No .
Then why are we here , my friends ?
<unk> we in possession of a <unk> secret , and do we require <unk> , and wine , and oil , or what is much the same thing , money , for the keeping thereof ?
Probably so , my friends . ” “ You ’ re a man of business , you are , ” returns Mr. Bucket , very attentive , “ and consequently you ’ re going on to mention what the nature of your secret is .
You are right .
You couldn ’ t do better . ” “ Let us then , my brother , in a spirit of love , ” says Mr. Chadband with a <unk> eye , “ proceed unto it .
Rachael , my wife , advance ! ” Mrs. Chadband , more than ready , so advances as to <unk> her husband into the <unk> and <unk> Mr. Bucket with a hard , frowning smile .
“ Since you want to know what we know , ” says she , “ I ’ ll tell you .
I helped to bring up Miss Hawdon , her ladyship ’ s daughter .
I was in the service of her ladyship ’ s sister , who was very sensitive to the disgrace her ladyship brought upon her , and gave out , even to her ladyship , that the child was dead — she WAS very nearly so — when she was born .
But she ’ s alive , and I know her . ” With these words , and a laugh , and laying a bitter <unk> on the word “ ladyship , ” Mrs. Chadband folds her arms and looks <unk> at Mr. Bucket .
“ I suppose now , ” returns that officer , “ YOU will be expecting a <unk> note or a present of about that figure ? ” Mrs. Chadband merely laughs and <unk> tells him he can “ offer ” twenty <unk> .
“ My friend the law-stationer ’ s good lady , over there , ” says Mr. Bucket , <unk> Mrs. Snagsby forward with the finger .
“ What may YOUR game be , ma ’ am ? ” Mrs. Snagsby is at first prevented , by tears and <unk> , from stating the nature of her game , but by degrees it <unk> comes to light that she is a woman <unk> with <unk> and wrongs , whom Mr. Snagsby has habitually <unk> , abandoned , and sought to keep in darkness , and whose chief comfort , under her <unk> , has been the sympathy of the late Mr. Tulkinghorn , who showed so much <unk> for her on one occasion of his calling in Cook ’ s Court in the absence of her <unk> husband that she has of late habitually carried to him all her <unk> .
Everybody it appears , the present company <unk> , has <unk> against Mrs. Snagsby ’ s peace .
There is Mr. Guppy , clerk to Kenge and Carboy , who was at first as open as the sun at noon , but who suddenly shut up as close as midnight , under the influence — no doubt — of Mr. Snagsby ’ s <unk> and <unk> .
There is Mr. Weevle , friend of Mr. Guppy , who lived mysteriously up a court , <unk> to the like <unk> causes .
There was Krook , deceased ; there was Nimrod , deceased ; and there was Jo , deceased ; and they were “ all in it . ” In what , Mrs. Snagsby does not with <unk> express , but she knows that Jo was Mr. Snagsby ’ s son , “ as well as if a <unk> had spoken it , ” and she followed Mr. Snagsby when he went on his last visit to the boy , and if he was not his son why did he go ?
The one occupation of her life has been , for some time back , to follow Mr. Snagsby to and fro , and up and down , and to piece suspicious circumstances together — and every circumstance that has happened has been most suspicious ; and in this way she has pursued her object of <unk> and <unk> her false husband , night and day .
Thus did it come to pass that she brought the Chadbands and Mr. Tulkinghorn together , and <unk> with Mr. Tulkinghorn on the change in Mr. Guppy , and helped to turn up the circumstances in which the present company are interested , casually , by the <unk> , being still and ever on the great high road that is to <unk> in Mr. Snagsby ’ s full <unk> and a <unk> separation .
All this , Mrs. Snagsby , as an injured woman , and the friend of Mrs. Chadband , and the <unk> of Mr. Chadband , and the <unk> of the late Mr. Tulkinghorn , is here to <unk> under the seal of confidence , with every possible confusion and <unk> possible and impossible , having no <unk> <unk> whatever , no scheme or project but the one mentioned , and bringing here , and taking everywhere , her own dense atmosphere of dust , arising from the <unk> working of her mill of jealousy .
While this <unk> is in hand — and it takes some time — Mr.
Bucket , who has seen through the <unk> of Mrs. Snagsby ’ s <unk> at a glance , <unk> with his familiar demon and <unk> his shrewd attention on the Chadbands and Mr. Smallweed .
Sir Leicester Dedlock remains immovable , with the same <unk> surface upon him , except that he once or twice looks towards Mr. Bucket , as <unk> on that officer alone of all mankind .
“ Very good , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Now I understand you , you know , and being <unk> by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , to look into this little matter , ” again Sir Leicester <unk> bows in confirmation of the <unk> , “ can give it my fair and full attention .
Now I won ’ t allude to <unk> to <unk> money or anything of that sort , because we are men and women of the world here , and our object is to make things pleasant .
But I tell you what I DO wonder at ; I am surprised that you should think of making a noise below in the hall .
It was so <unk> to your interests .
That ’ s what I look at . ” “ We wanted to get in , ” <unk> Mr. Smallweed .
“ Why , of course you wanted to get in , ” Mr. Bucket <unk> with cheerfulness ; “ but for a old gentleman at your time of life — what I call truly venerable , mind you ! — with his wits <unk> , as I have no doubt they are , by the loss of the use of his <unk> , which occasions all his animation to mount up into his head , not to consider that if he don ’ t keep such a business as the present as close as possible it can ’ t be worth a <unk> to him , is so curious !
You see your temper got the better of you ; that ’ s where you lost ground , ” says Mr. Bucket in an <unk> and friendly way .
“ I only said I wouldn ’ t go without one of the servants came up to Sir Leicester Dedlock , ” returns Mr. Smallweed .
“ That ’ s it !
That ’ s where your temper got the better of you .
Now , you keep it under another time and you ’ ll make money by it .
Shall I ring for them to carry you down ? ” “ When are we to hear more of this ? ” Mrs. Chadband sternly demands .
“ Bless your heart for a true woman !
Always curious , your delightful sex is ! ” replies Mr. Bucket with gallantry .
“ I shall have the pleasure of giving you a call to-morrow or next day — not <unk> Mr. Smallweed and his proposal of two fifty . ” “ <unk> hundred ! ” exclaims Mr. Smallweed .
“ All right !
<unk> five hundred . ” Mr. Bucket has his hand on the <unk> .
“ <unk> I wish you good day for the present on the part of myself and the gentleman of the house ? ” he asks in an <unk> tone .
Nobody having the <unk> to object to his doing so , he does it , and the party retire as they came up .
Mr. Bucket follows them to the door , and returning , says with an air of serious business , “ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , it ’ s for you to consider whether or not to buy this up .
I should recommend , on the whole , it ’ s being bought up myself ; and I think it may be bought pretty cheap .
You see , that little <unk> <unk> of a Mrs. Snagsby has been used by all sides of the speculation and has done a deal more harm in bringing odds and ends together than if she had meant it .
Mr. Tulkinghorn , deceased , he held all these horses in his hand and could have drove ’ em his own way , I haven ’ t a doubt ; but he was fetched off the box <unk> , and now they have got their legs over the traces , and are all dragging and pulling their own ways .
So it is , and such is life .
The cat ’ s away , and the <unk> they play ; the <unk> breaks up , and the water runs .
Now , with regard to the party to be <unk> . ” Sir Leicester seems to wake , though his eyes have been wide open , and he looks <unk> at Mr. Bucket as Mr. Bucket refers to his watch .
“ The party to be <unk> is now in this house , ” proceeds Mr. Bucket , putting up his watch with a steady hand and with rising spirits , “ and I ’ m about to take her into custody in your presence .
Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , don ’ t you say a word nor yet stir .
There ’ ll be no noise and no <unk> at all .
I ’ ll come back in the course of the evening , if agreeable to you , and endeavour to meet your wishes respecting this unfortunate family matter and the <unk> way of keeping it quiet .
Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , don ’ t you be nervous on account of the apprehension at present coming off .
You shall see the whole case clear , from first to last . ” Mr. Bucket rings , goes to the door , briefly whispers Mercury , shuts the door , and stands behind it with his arms folded .
After a suspense of a minute or two the door slowly opens and a Frenchwoman enters .
Mademoiselle Hortense .
The moment she is in the room Mr. Bucket <unk> the door to and puts his back against it .
The <unk> of the noise occasions her to turn , and then for the first time she sees Sir Leicester Dedlock in his chair .
“ I ask you pardon , ” she mutters hurriedly .
“ They tell me there was no one here . ” Her step towards the door brings her front to front with Mr. Bucket .
<unk> a <unk> <unk> across her face and she turns deadly pale .
“ This is my lodger , Sir Leicester Dedlock , ” says Mr. Bucket , nodding at her .
“ This foreign young woman has been my lodger for some weeks back . ” “ What do Sir Leicester care for that , you think , my angel ? ” returns mademoiselle in a <unk> <unk> .
“ Why , my angel , ” returns Mr. Bucket , “ we shall see . ” Mademoiselle Hortense eyes him with a <unk> upon her tight face , which gradually changes into a smile of scorn , “ You are very <unk> .
Are you drunk ? ” “ <unk> <unk> , my angel , ” returns Mr. Bucket .
“ I come from arriving at this so <unk> house with your wife .
Your wife have left me since some minutes .
They tell me downstairs that your wife is here .
I come here , and your wife is not here .
What is the intention of this fool ’ s play , say then ? ” mademoiselle demands , with her arms composedly crossed , but with something in her dark cheek beating like a clock .
Mr. Bucket merely shakes the finger at her .
“ Ah , my God , you are an unhappy <unk> ! ” cries mademoiselle with a <unk> of her head and a laugh .
“ <unk> me to pass downstairs , great pig . ” With a stamp of her foot and a <unk> .
“ Now , mademoiselle , ” says Mr. Bucket in a cool determined way , “ you go and sit down upon that <unk> . ” “ I will not sit down upon nothing , ” she replies with a shower of nods .
“ Now , mademoiselle , ” repeats Mr. Bucket , making no <unk> except with the finger , “ you sit down upon that <unk> . ” “ Why ? ” “ Because I take you into custody on a charge of murder , and you don ’ t need to be told it .
Now , I want to be polite to one of your sex and a foreigner if I can .
If I can ’ t , I must be rough , and there ’ s <unk> ones outside .
What I am to be <unk> on you .
So I recommend you , as a friend , afore another half a blessed moment has passed over your head , to go and sit down upon that <unk> . ” Mademoiselle <unk> , saying in a <unk> voice while that something in her cheek beats fast and hard , “ You are a devil . ” “ Now , you see , ” Mr. Bucket proceeds <unk> , “ you ’ re comfortable and conducting yourself as I should expect a foreign young woman of your sense to do .
So I ’ ll give you a piece of advice , and it ’ s this , don ’ t you talk too much .
You ’ re not expected to say anything here , and you can ’ t keep too quiet a tongue in your head .
In short , the less you <unk> , the better , you know . ” Mr. Bucket is very complacent over this French explanation .
Mademoiselle , with that <unk> <unk> of the mouth and her black eyes <unk> fire upon him , sits upright on the sofa in a <unk> state , with her hands <unk> — and her feet too , one might suppose — muttering , “ Oh , you Bucket , you are a devil ! ” “ Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ” says Mr. Bucket , and from this time forth the finger never rests , “ this young woman , my lodger , was her ladyship ’ s maid at the time I have mentioned to you ; and this young woman , besides being extraordinary vehement and passionate against her ladyship after being discharged — ” “ Lie ! ” cries mademoiselle .
“ I discharge myself . ” “ Now , why don ’ t you take my advice ? ” returns Mr. Bucket in an impressive , almost in an imploring , tone .
“ I ’ m surprised at the <unk> you commit .
You ’ ll say something that ’ ll be used against you , you know .
You ’ re sure to come to it .
Never you mind what I say till it ’ s given in evidence .
It is not addressed to you . ” “ <unk> , too , ” cries mademoiselle <unk> , “ by her ladyship !
Eh , my faith , a pretty ladyship !
Why , I <unk> my character by remaining with a ladyship so <unk> ! ” “ Upon my soul I wonder at you ! ” Mr. Bucket remonstrates .
“ I thought the French were a polite <unk> , I did , really .
Yet to hear a female going on like that before Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ! ” “ He is a poor <unk> ! ” cries mademoiselle .
“ I <unk> upon his house , upon his name , upon his <unk> , ” all of which she makes the carpet represent .
“ Oh , that he is a great man !
Oh , yes , <unk> !
Oh , heaven !
<unk> ! ” “ Well , Sir Leicester Dedlock , ” proceeds Mr. Bucket , “ this <unk> foreigner also angrily took it into her head that she had established a claim upon Mr. Tulkinghorn , deceased , by attending on the occasion I told you of at his chambers , though she was <unk> paid for her time and trouble . ” “ Lie ! ” cries mademoiselle .
“ I <unk> his money all <unk> . ” “ If you WILL <unk> , you know , ” says Mr. Bucket <unk> , “ you must take the consequences .
Now , whether she became my lodger , Sir Leicester Dedlock , with any <unk> intention then of doing this deed and <unk> me , I give no opinion on ; but she lived in my house in that capacity at the time that she was hovering about the chambers of the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn with a view to a <unk> , and likewise <unk> and half <unk> the life out of an unfortunate stationer . ” “ Lie ! ” cries mademoiselle .
“ All lie ! ” “ The murder was committed , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and you know under what circumstances .
Now , I beg of you to follow me close with your attention for a minute or two .
I was sent for , and the case was <unk> to me .
I examined the place , and the body , and the papers , and everything .
From information I received ( from a clerk in the same house ) I took George into custody as having been seen hanging about there on the night , and at very <unk> the time of the murder , also as having been overheard in high words with the deceased on former occasions — even threatening him , as the witness made out .
If you ask me , Sir Leicester Dedlock , whether from the first I believed George to be the <unk> , I tell you <unk> no , but he might be , notwithstanding , and there was enough against him to make it my duty to take him and get him kept under <unk> .
Now , observe ! ” As Mr. Bucket bends forward in some excitement — for him — and <unk> what he is going to say with one ghostly beat of his forefinger in the air , Mademoiselle Hortense <unk> her black eyes upon him with a dark frown and sets her dry lips closely and <unk> together .
“ I went home , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , at night and found this young woman having supper with my wife , Mrs. Bucket .
She had made a mighty show of being fond of Mrs. Bucket from her first offering herself as our lodger , but that night she made more than ever — in fact , <unk> it .
<unk> she <unk> her respect , and all that , for the <unk> memory of the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn .
By the living Lord it <unk> upon me , as I sat opposite to her at the table and saw her with a knife in her hand , that she had done it ! ” Mademoiselle is hardly audible in <unk> through her teeth and lips the words , “ You are a devil . ” “ Now where , ” pursues Mr. Bucket , “ had she been on the night of the murder ?
She had been to the <unk> .
( She really was there , I have since found , both before the deed and after it . )
I knew I had an artful customer to deal with and that proof would be very difficult ; and I laid a <unk> for her — such a <unk> as I never laid yet , and such a venture as I never made yet .
I worked it out in my mind while I was talking to her at supper .
When I went upstairs to bed , our house being small and this young woman ’ s ears sharp , I stuffed the <unk> into Mrs. Bucket ’ s mouth that she shouldn ’ t say a word of surprise and told her all about it .
My dear , don ’ t you give your mind to that again , or I shall link your feet together at the <unk> . ” Mr. Bucket , breaking off , has made a <unk> <unk> upon mademoiselle and laid his heavy hand upon her shoulder .
“ What is the matter with you now ? ” she asks him .
“ Don ’ t you think any more , ” returns Mr. Bucket with <unk> finger , “ of throwing yourself out of window .
That ’ s what ’ s the matter with me .
Come !
Just take my arm .
You needn ’ t get up ; I ’ ll sit down by you .
Now take my arm , will you ?
I ’ m a married man , you know ; you ’ re acquainted with my wife .
Just take my arm . ” <unk> endeavouring to <unk> those dry lips , with a painful sound she <unk> with herself and <unk> .
“ Now we ’ re all right again .
Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , this case could never have been the case it is but for Mrs. Bucket , who is a woman in fifty thousand — in a hundred and fifty thousand !
To throw this young woman off her guard , I have never set foot in our house since , though I ’ ve communicated with Mrs. Bucket in the <unk> ’ s <unk> and in the milk as often as required .
My whispered words to Mrs. Bucket when she had the <unk> in her mouth were , ‘ My dear , can you throw her off continually with natural accounts of my suspicions against George , and this , and that , and t ’ other ?
Can you do without rest and keep watch upon her night and day ?
Can you undertake to say , ‘ She shall do nothing without my knowledge , she shall be my prisoner without <unk> it , she shall no more escape from me than from death , and her life shall be my life , and her soul my soul , till I have got her , if she did this murder ? ’ Mrs. Bucket says to me , as well as she could speak on account of the <unk> , ‘ Bucket , I can ! ’ And she has <unk> up to it glorious ! ” “ <unk> ! ” mademoiselle interposes .
“ All lies , my friend ! ” “ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , how did my <unk> come out under these circumstances ?
When I calculated that this <unk> young woman would <unk> it in new directions , was I wrong or right ?
I was right .
What does she try to do ?
Don ’ t let it give you a turn ?
To throw the murder on her ladyship . ” Sir Leicester rises from his chair and <unk> down again .
“ And she got encouragement in it from hearing that I was always here , which was done <unk> .
Now , open that <unk> of mine , Sir Leicester Dedlock , if I may take the liberty of throwing it towards you , and look at the letters sent to me , each with the two words ‘ Lady Dedlock ’ in it .
<unk> the one directed to yourself , which I stopped this very morning , and read the three words ‘ Lady Dedlock , <unk> ’ in it .
These letters have been falling about like a shower of <unk> .
What do you say now to Mrs. Bucket , from her <unk> having seen them all written by this young woman ?
What do you say to Mrs. Bucket having , within this half-hour , secured the <unk> ink and paper , fellow <unk> and what not ?
What do you say to Mrs. Bucket having watched the <unk> of ’ em every one by this young woman , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ? ” Mr. Bucket asks , triumphant in his admiration of his lady ’ s <unk> .
Two things are especially <unk> as Mr. Bucket proceeds to a conclusion .
First , that he seems <unk> to establish a dreadful right of property in mademoiselle .
Secondly , that the very atmosphere she <unk> seems to narrow and <unk> about her as if a close <unk> or a <unk> were being drawn nearer and yet nearer around her breathless figure .
“ There is no doubt that her ladyship was on the spot at the <unk> period , ” says Mr. Bucket , “ and my foreign friend here saw her , I believe , from the upper part of the staircase .
Her ladyship and George and my foreign friend were all pretty close on one another ’ s heels .
But that don ’ t <unk> any more , so I ’ ll not go into it .
I found the <unk> of the pistol with which the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn was shot .
It was a bit of the printed description of your house at Chesney Wold .
Not much in that , you ’ ll say , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet .
No .
But when my foreign friend here is so thoroughly off her guard as to think it a safe time to tear up the rest of that leaf , and when Mrs. Bucket puts the pieces together and finds the <unk> wanting , it begins to look like <unk> Street . ” “ These are very long lies , ” mademoiselle interposes .
“ You prose great deal .
Is it that you have almost all finished , or are you speaking always ? ” “ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ” proceeds Mr. Bucket , who <unk> in a full title and does violence to himself when he <unk> with any fragment of it , “ the last point in the case which I am now going to mention shows the necessity of patience in our business , and never doing a thing in a hurry .
I watched this young woman yesterday without her knowledge when she was looking at the funeral , in company with my wife , who <unk> to take her there ; and I had so much to <unk> her , and I saw such an expression in her face , and my mind so rose against her <unk> towards her ladyship , and the time was altogether such a time for bringing down what you may call <unk> upon her , that if I had been a younger hand with less experience , I should have taken her , certain .
<unk> , last night , when her ladyship , as is so universally admired I am sure , come home looking — why , Lord , a man might almost say like <unk> rising from the <unk> — it was so unpleasant and <unk> to think of her being charged with a murder of which she was innocent that I felt quite to want to put an end to the job .
What should I have lost ?
Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I should have lost the <unk> .
My prisoner here proposed to Mrs. Bucket , after the departure of the funeral , that they should go <unk> <unk> a little ways into the country and take tea at a very decent house of entertainment .
Now , near that house of entertainment there ’ s a piece of water .
At tea , my prisoner got up to fetch her <unk> from the bedroom where the bonnets was ; she was rather a long time gone and came back a little out of wind .
As soon as they came home this was reported to me by Mrs. Bucket , along with her observations and suspicions .
I had the piece of water dragged by moonlight , in presence of a couple of our men , and the pocket pistol was brought up before it had been there half-a-dozen hours .
Now , my dear , put your arm a little further through mine , and hold it steady , and I <unk> ’ t hurt you ! ” In a <unk> Mr. Bucket <unk> a <unk> on her <unk> .
“ That ’ s one , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Now the other , darling .
Two , and all told ! ” He rises ; she rises too .
“ Where , ” she asks him , darkening her large eyes until their drooping <unk> almost conceal them — and yet they stare , “ where is your false , your <unk> , and <unk> wife ? ” “ She ’ s gone <unk> to the <unk> Office , ” returns Mr. Bucket .
“ You ’ ll see her there , my dear . ” “ I would like to kiss her ! ” exclaims Mademoiselle Hortense , panting <unk> .
“ You ’ d bite her , I suspect , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ I would ! ” making her eyes very large .
“ I would love to tear her limb from limb . ” “ Bless you , darling , ” says Mr. Bucket with the greatest composure , “ I ’ m fully prepared to hear that .
Your sex have such a surprising <unk> against one another when you do <unk> .
You don ’ t mind me half so much , do you ? ” “ No .
Though you are a devil still . ” “ <unk> and devil by turns , eh ? ” cries Mr. Bucket .
“ But I am in my regular employment , you must consider .
Let me put your shawl tidy .
I ’ ve been lady ’ s maid to a good many before now .
Anything wanting to the bonnet ?
There ’ s a cab at the door . ” Mademoiselle Hortense , casting an indignant eye at the glass , shakes herself perfectly neat in one shake and looks , to do her justice , uncommonly genteel .
“ Listen then , my angel , ” says she after several <unk> nods .
“ You are very spiritual .
But can you restore him back to life ? ” Mr. Bucket answers , “ Not exactly . ” “ That is droll .
Listen yet one time .
You are very spiritual .
Can you make a honourable lady of her ? ” “ Don ’ t be so <unk> , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Or a haughty gentleman of HIM ? ” cries mademoiselle , referring to Sir Leicester with <unk> <unk> .
“ Eh !
Oh , then regard him !
The poor infant !
Ha !
Ha !
Ha ! ” “ Come , come , why this is worse <unk> than the other , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Come along ! ” “ You cannot do these things ?
Then you can do as you please with me .
It is but the death , it is all the same .
Let us go , my angel .
<unk> , you old man , grey .
I pity you , and I <unk> you ! ” With these last words she <unk> her teeth together as if her mouth closed with a spring .
It is impossible to describe how Mr. Bucket gets her out , but he <unk> that <unk> in a manner so peculiar to himself , <unk> and <unk> her like a cloud , and hovering away with her as if he were a homely <unk> and she the object of his <unk> .
Sir Leicester , left alone , remains in the same attitude , as though he were still listening and his attention were still occupied .
At length he <unk> round the empty room , and finding it deserted , rises <unk> to his feet , <unk> back his chair , and walks a few steps , <unk> himself by the table .
Then he stops , and with more of those <unk> sounds , lifts up his eyes and seems to stare at something .
Heaven knows what he sees .
The green , green woods of Chesney Wold , the noble house , the pictures of his <unk> , <unk> <unk> them , officers of police <unk> <unk> his most precious <unk> , thousands of fingers pointing at him , thousands of faces <unk> at him .
But if such shadows <unk> before him to his <unk> , there is one other shadow which he can name with something like distinctness even yet and to which alone he addresses his tearing of his white hair and his extended arms .
It is she in association with whom , <unk> that she has been for years a main <unk> of the <unk> of his dignity and pride , he has never had a selfish thought .
It is she whom he has loved , admired , honoured , and set up for the world to respect .
It is she who , at the <unk> of all the constrained <unk> and <unk> of his life , has been a stock of living tenderness and love , susceptible as nothing else is of being struck with the agony he feels .
He sees her , almost to the <unk> of himself , and cannot bear to look upon her cast down from the high place she has <unk> so well .
And even to the point of his sinking on the ground , <unk> of his suffering , he can yet <unk> her name with something like distinctness in the midst of those <unk> sounds , and in a tone of mourning and compassion rather than reproach .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> Inspector Bucket of the Detective has not yet struck his great blow , as just now <unk> , but is yet <unk> himself with sleep <unk> to his <unk> , when through the night and along the <unk> wintry roads a chaise and pair comes out of Lincolnshire , making its way towards London .
<unk> shall soon <unk> all this country , and with a rattle and a glare the <unk> and train shall <unk> like a <unk> over the wide <unk> , turning the moon <unk> ; but as yet such things are <unk> in these parts , though not wholly unexpected .
<unk> are <unk> , <unk> are made , ground is <unk> out .
<unk> are begun , and their not yet united <unk> <unk> look at one another over roads and streams like brick and mortar <unk> with an <unk> to their <unk> ; fragments of <unk> are thrown up and left as <unk> with <unk> of rusty <unk> and <unk> tumbling over them ; <unk> of tall <unk> appear on <unk> , where there are <unk> of <unk> ; everything looks <unk> and abandoned in full <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> roads , and through the night , the <unk> makes its way without a <unk> on its mind .
Mrs. Rouncewell , so many years housekeeper at Chesney Wold , sits within the chaise ; and by her side sits Mrs. Bagnet with her grey cloak and umbrella .
The old girl would prefer the bar in front , as being exposed to the weather and a <unk> sort of <unk> more in <unk> with her usual course of travelling , but Mrs. Rouncewell is too thoughtful of her comfort to admit of her proposing it .
The old lady cannot make enough of the old girl .
She sits , in her stately manner , holding her hand , and <unk> of its <unk> , puts it often to her lips .
“ You are a mother , my dear soul , ” says she many times , “ and you found out my George ’ s mother ! ” “ Why , George , ” returns Mrs. Bagnet , “ was always free with me , ma ’ am , and when he said at our house to my Woolwich that of all the things my Woolwich could have to think of when he grew to be a man , the <unk> would be that he had never brought a sorrowful line into his mother ’ s face or turned a hair of her head grey , then I felt sure , from his way , that something fresh had brought his own mother into his mind .
I had often known him say to me , in past times , that he had <unk> bad to her . ” “ Never , my dear ! ” returns Mrs. Rouncewell , bursting into tears .
“ My blessing on him , never !
He was always fond of me , and loving to me , was my George !
But he had a bold spirit , and he ran a little wild and went for a soldier .
And I know he waited at first , in letting us know about himself , till he should rise to be an officer ; and when he didn ’ t rise , I know he considered himself beneath us , and wouldn ’ t be a disgrace to us .
For he had a <unk> heart , had my George , always from a baby ! ” The old lady ’ s hands stray about her as of <unk> , while she recalls , all in a tremble , what a likely lad , what a fine lad , what a gay good-humoured clever lad he was ; how they all took to him down at Chesney Wold ; how Sir Leicester took to him when he was a young gentleman ; how the dogs took to him ; how even the people who had been angry with him <unk> him the moment he was gone , poor boy .
And now to see him after all , and in a prison too !
And the broad stomacher <unk> , and the <unk> upright old-fashioned figure bends under its load of affectionate distress .
Mrs. Bagnet , with the <unk> skill of a good warm heart , leaves the old housekeeper to her emotions for a little while — not without passing the back of her hand across her own motherly eyes — and presently <unk> up in her <unk> manner , “ So I says to George when I goes to call him in to tea ( he pretended to be smoking his pipe outside ) , ‘ What <unk> you this afternoon , George , for gracious sake ?
I have seen all sorts , and I have seen you pretty often in season and out of season , abroad and at home , and I never see you so melancholy <unk> . ’ ‘ Why , Mrs. Bagnet , ’ says George , ‘ it ’ s because I AM melancholy and <unk> both , this afternoon , that you see me so . ’ ‘ What have you done , old fellow ? ’ I says .
‘ Why , Mrs. Bagnet , ’ says George , shaking his head , ‘ what I have done has been done this many a long year , and is best not tried to be undone now .
If I ever get to heaven it won ’ t be for being a good son to a <unk> mother ; I say no more . ’ Now , ma ’ am , when George says to me that it ’ s best not tried to be undone now , I have my thoughts as I have often had before , and I draw it out of George how he comes to have such things on him that afternoon .
Then George tells me that he has seen by chance , at the lawyer ’ s office , a fine old lady that has brought his mother plain before him , and he runs on about that old lady till he quite <unk> himself and <unk> her picture to me as she used to be , years upon years back .
So I says to George when he has done , who is this old lady he has seen ?
And George tells me it ’ s Mrs. Rouncewell , housekeeper for more than half a century to the Dedlock family down at Chesney Wold in Lincolnshire .
George has frequently told me before that he ’ s a Lincolnshire man , and I says to my old Lignum that night , ‘ Lignum , that ’ s his mother for five and <unk> pound ! ’ ” All this Mrs. Bagnet now relates for the <unk> time at least within the last four hours .
<unk> it out like a kind of bird , with a pretty high note , that it may be audible to the old lady above the hum of the wheels .
“ Bless you , and thank you , ” says Mrs. Rouncewell .
“ Bless you , and thank you , my worthy soul ! ” “ Dear heart ! ” cries Mrs. Bagnet in the most natural manner .
“ No thanks to me , I am sure .
<unk> to yourself , ma ’ am , for being so ready to pay ’ em !
And mind once more , ma ’ am , what you had best do on finding George to be your own son is to make him — for your sake — have every sort of help to put himself in the right and clear himself of a charge of which he is as innocent as you or me .
It won ’ t do to have truth and justice on his side ; he must have law and lawyers , ” exclaims the old girl , apparently persuaded that the latter form a separate establishment and have <unk> <unk> with truth and justice for ever and a day .
“ He shall have , ” says Mrs. Rouncewell , “ all the help that can be got for him in the world , my dear .
I will spend all I have , and <unk> , to <unk> it .
Sir Leicester will do his best , the whole family will do their best .
I — I know something , my dear ; and will make my own appeal , as his mother parted from him all these years , and finding him in a <unk> at last . ” The extreme <unk> of the old housekeeper ’ s manner in saying this , her broken words , and her <unk> of her hands make a powerful impression on Mrs. Bagnet and would <unk> her but that she refers them all to her sorrow for her son ’ s condition .
And yet Mrs. Bagnet wonders too why Mrs. Rouncewell should murmur so <unk> , “ My Lady , my Lady , my Lady ! ” over and over again .
The frosty night wears away , and the <unk> breaks , and the <unk> comes rolling on through the early mist like the ghost of a chaise departed .
It has plenty of <unk> company in ghosts of trees and <unk> , slowly <unk> and giving place to the <unk> of day .
London reached , the <unk> <unk> , the old housekeeper in great <unk> and confusion , Mrs. Bagnet quite fresh and collected — as she would be if her next point , with no new <unk> and <unk> , were the <unk> of Good <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or any other military station .
But when they set out for the prison where the trooper is confined , the old lady has <unk> to draw about her , with her <unk> dress , much of the <unk> calmness which is its usual <unk> .
A wonderfully grave , <unk> , and handsome piece of old <unk> she looks , though her heart beats fast and her stomacher is ruffled more than even the remembrance of this <unk> son has ruffled it these many years .
<unk> the <unk> , they find the door opening and a <unk> in the act of coming out .
The old girl promptly makes a sign of entreaty to him to say nothing ; <unk> with a nod , he <unk> them to enter as he shuts the door .
So George , who is writing at his table , supposing himself to be alone , does not raise his eyes , but remains absorbed .
The old housekeeper looks at him , and those wandering hands of hers are quite enough for Mrs. Bagnet ’ s confirmation , even if she could see the mother and the son together , knowing what she knows , and doubt their relationship .
Not a <unk> of the housekeeper ’ s dress , not a gesture , not a word <unk> her .
She stands looking at him as he writes on , all unconscious , and only her fluttering hands give utterance to her emotions .
But they are very eloquent , very , very eloquent .
Mrs. Bagnet <unk> them .
They speak of gratitude , of joy , of grief , of hope ; of <unk> affection , <unk> with no return since this stalwart man was a <unk> ; of a better son loved less , and this son loved so <unk> and so <unk> ; and they speak in such touching language that Mrs. Bagnet ’ s eyes <unk> up with tears and they run <unk> down her <unk> face .
“ George Rouncewell !
Oh , my dear child , turn and look at me ! ” The trooper starts up , <unk> his mother round the neck , and falls down on his knees before her .
Whether in a late <unk> , whether in the first association that comes back upon him , he puts his hands together as a child does when it says its prayers , and raising them towards her breast , bows down his head , and cries .
“ My George , my dearest son !
Always my favourite , and my favourite still , where have you been these cruel years and years ?
<unk> such a man too , grown such a fine strong man .
<unk> so like what I knew he must be , if it pleased God he was alive ! ” She can ask , and he can answer , nothing connected for a time .
All that time the old girl , turned away , leans one arm against the whitened wall , leans her honest forehead upon it , <unk> her eyes with her serviceable grey cloak , and quite <unk> herself like the best of old girls as she is .
“ Mother , ” says the trooper when they are more composed , “ forgive me first of all , for I know my need of it . ” <unk> him !
She does it with all her heart and soul .
She always has done it .
She tells him how she has had it written in her will , these many years , that he was her beloved son George .
She has never believed any ill of him , never .
If she had died without this happiness — and she is an old woman now and can ’ t look to live very long — she would have blessed him with her last breath , if she had had her senses , as her beloved son George .
“ Mother , I have been an <unk> trouble to you , and I have my reward ; but of late years I have had a kind of <unk> of a purpose in me too .
When I left home I didn ’ t care much , mother — I am afraid not a great deal — for leaving ; and went away and ’ <unk> , <unk> , making believe to think that I cared for nobody , no not I , and that nobody cared for me . ” The trooper has dried his eyes and put away his handkerchief , but there is an extraordinary contrast between his habitual manner of expressing himself and carrying himself and the softened tone in which he speaks , interrupted occasionally by a <unk> sob .
“ So I wrote a line home , mother , as you too well know , to say I had ’ <unk> under another name , and I went abroad .
<unk> , at one time I thought I would write home next year , when I might be better off ; and when that year was out , I thought I would write home next year , when I might be better off ; and when that year was out again , perhaps I didn ’ t think much about it .
So on , from year to year , through a service of ten years , till I began to get older , and to ask myself why should I ever write . ” “ I don ’ t find any fault , child — but not to ease my mind , George ?
Not a word to your loving mother , who was growing older too ? ” This almost <unk> the trooper afresh , but he sets himself up with a great , rough , sounding <unk> of his throat .
“ Heaven forgive me , mother , but I thought there would be small consolation then in hearing anything about me .
There were you , respected and esteemed .
There was my brother , as I read in chance North <unk> papers now and then , rising to be prosperous and famous .
There was I a <unk> , <unk> , unsettled , not <unk> like him , but <unk> — all my earlier advantages thrown away , all my little <unk> <unk> , nothing picked up but what <unk> me for most things that I could think of .
What business had I to make myself known ?
After letting all that time go by me , what good could come of it ?
The worst was past with you , mother .
I knew by that time ( being a man ) how you had <unk> for me , and wept for me , and prayed for me ; and the pain was over , or was softened down , and I was better in your mind as it was . ” The old lady <unk> shakes her head , and taking one of his powerful hands , lays it <unk> upon her shoulder .
“ No , I don ’ t say that it was so , mother , but that I made it out to be so .
I said just now , what good could come of it ?
Well , my dear mother , some good might have come of it to myself — and there was the meanness of it .
You would have sought me out ; you would have <unk> my discharge ; you would have taken me down to Chesney Wold ; you would have brought me and my brother and my brother ’ s family together ; you would all have considered anxiously how to do something for me and set me up as a respectable <unk> .
But how could any of you feel sure of me when I couldn ’ t so much as feel sure of myself ?
How could you help regarding as an <unk> and a <unk> to you an idle <unk> chap who was an <unk> and a <unk> to himself , excepting under discipline ?
How could I look my brother ’ s children in the face and pretend to set them an example — I , the vagabond boy who had run away from home and been the grief and <unk> of my mother ’ s life ?
‘ No , George . ’ Such were my words , mother , when I passed this in <unk> before me : ‘ You have made your bed .
Now , lie upon it . ’ ” Mrs. Rouncewell , drawing up her stately form , shakes her head at the old girl with a <unk> pride upon her , as much as to say , “ I told you so ! ” The old girl <unk> her feelings and <unk> her interest in the conversation by giving the trooper a great poke between the shoulders with her umbrella ; this action she afterwards repeats , at intervals , in a species of affectionate lunacy , never <unk> , after the administration of each of these <unk> , to <unk> to the whitened wall and the grey cloak again .
“ This was the way I brought myself to think , mother , that my best <unk> was to lie upon that bed I had made , and die upon it .
And I should have done it ( though I have been to see you more than once down at Chesney Wold , when you little thought of me ) but for my old comrade ’ s wife here , who I find has been too many for me .
But I thank her for it .
I thank you for it , Mrs. Bagnet , with all my heart and might . ” To which Mrs. Bagnet <unk> with two pokes .
And now the old lady <unk> upon her son George , her own dear recovered boy , her joy and pride , the light of her eyes , the happy close of her life , and every fond name she can think of , that he must be <unk> by the best advice <unk> by money and influence , that he must yield up his case to the greatest lawyers that can be got , that he must act in this serious <unk> as he shall be advised to act and must not be <unk> , however right , but must promise to think only of his poor old mother ’ s anxiety and suffering until he is released , or he will break her heart .
“ Mother , ’ <unk> little enough to consent to , ” returns the trooper , stopping her with a kiss ; “ tell me what I shall do , and I ’ ll make a late beginning and do it .
Mrs. Bagnet , you ’ ll take care of my mother , I know ? ” A very hard poke from the old girl ’ s umbrella .
“ If you ’ ll bring her acquainted with Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson , she will find them of her way of thinking , and they will give her the best advice and assistance . ” “ And , George , ” says the old lady , “ we must send with all haste for your brother .
He is a sensible sound man as they tell me — out in the world beyond Chesney Wold , my dear , though I don ’ t know much of it myself — and will be of great service . ” “ Mother , ” returns the trooper , “ is it too soon to ask a favour ? ” “ Surely not , my dear . ” “ Then <unk> me this one great favour .
Don ’ t let my brother know . ” “ Not know what , my dear ? ” “ Not know of me .
In fact , mother , I can ’ t bear it ; I can ’ t make up my mind to it .
He has proved himself so different from me and has done so much to raise himself while I ’ ve been <unk> that I haven ’ t <unk> enough in my composition to see him in this place and under this charge .
How could a man like him be expected to have any pleasure in such a discovery ?
It ’ s impossible .
No , keep my secret from him , mother ; do me a greater kindness than I <unk> and keep my secret from my brother , of all men . ” “ But not always , dear George ? ” “ Why , mother , perhaps not for good and all — though I may come to ask that too — but keep it now , I do entreat you .
If it ’ s ever broke to him that his <unk> of a brother has turned up , I could wish , ” says the trooper , shaking his head very <unk> , “ to break it myself and be <unk> as to advancing or <unk> by the way in which he seems to take it . ” As he evidently has a rooted feeling on this point , and as the <unk> of it is recognized in Mrs. Bagnet ’ s face , his mother <unk> her <unk> assent to what he asks .
For this he thanks her kindly .
“ In all other respects , my dear mother , I ’ ll be as <unk> and <unk> as you can wish ; on this one alone , I stand out .
So now I am ready even for the lawyers .
I have been drawing up , ” he glances at his writing on the table , “ an exact account of what I knew of the deceased and how I came to be involved in this unfortunate affair .
It ’ s entered , plain and regular , like an <unk> ; not a word in it but what ’ s wanted for the facts .
I did intend to read it , straight on end , <unk> I was called upon to say anything in my <unk> .
I hope I may be let to do it still ; but I have no longer a will of my own in this case , and whatever is said or done , I give my promise not to have any . ” <unk> being brought to this so far satisfactory pass , and time being on the <unk> , Mrs. Bagnet proposes a departure .
Again and again the old lady <unk> upon her son ’ s neck , and again and again the trooper holds her to his broad chest .
“ Where are you going to take my mother , Mrs. Bagnet ? ” “ I am going to the town house , my dear , the family house .
I have some business there that must be looked to directly , ” Mrs. Rouncewell answers .
“ Will you see my mother safe there in a coach , Mrs. Bagnet ?
But of course I know you will .
Why should I ask it ! ” Why indeed , Mrs. Bagnet expresses with the umbrella .
“ Take her , my old friend , and take my gratitude along with you .
<unk> to Quebec and Malta , love to my godson , a hearty shake of the hand to Lignum , and this for yourself , and I wish it was ten thousand pound in gold , my dear ! ” So saying , the trooper puts his lips to the old girl ’ s <unk> forehead , and the door shuts upon him in his <unk> .
No entreaties on the part of the good old housekeeper will induce Mrs. Bagnet to retain the coach for her own <unk> home .
<unk> out cheerfully at the door of the Dedlock mansion and <unk> Mrs. Rouncewell up the steps , the old girl shakes hands and <unk> off , arriving soon afterwards in the bosom of the Bagnet family and falling to washing the greens as if nothing had happened .
My Lady is in that room in which she held her last conference with the murdered man , and is sitting where she sat that night , and is looking at the spot where he stood upon the hearth <unk> her so leisurely , when a tap comes at the door .
Who is it ?
Mrs. Rouncewell .
What has brought Mrs. Rouncewell to town so unexpectedly ?
“ <unk> , my Lady .
<unk> trouble .
Oh , my Lady , may I beg a word with you ? ” What new occurrence is it that makes this tranquil old woman tremble so ?
<unk> happier than her Lady , as her Lady has often thought , why does she <unk> in this manner and look at her with such strange mistrust ?
“ What is the matter ?
Sit down and take your breath . ” “ Oh , my Lady , my Lady .
I have found my son — my youngest , who went away for a soldier so long ago .
And he is in prison . ” “ For debt ? ” “ Oh , no , my Lady ; I would have paid any debt , and joyful . ” “ For what is he in prison then ? ” “ <unk> with a murder , my Lady , of which he is as innocent as — as I am .
<unk> of the murder of Mr. Tulkinghorn . ” What does she mean by this look and this imploring gesture ?
Why does she come so close ?
What is the letter that she holds ?
“ Lady Dedlock , my dear Lady , my good Lady , my kind Lady !
You must have a heart to feel for me , you must have a heart to forgive me .
I was in this family before you were born .
I am devoted to it .
But think of my dear son <unk> accused . ” “ I do not <unk> him . ” “ No , my Lady , no .
But others do , and he is in prison and in danger .
Oh , Lady Dedlock , if you can say but a word to help to clear him , say it ! ” What <unk> can this be ?
What power does she suppose is in the person she <unk> to <unk> this <unk> suspicion , if it be <unk> ?
Her Lady ’ s handsome eyes regard her with astonishment , almost with fear .
“ My Lady , I came away last night from Chesney Wold to find my son in my old age , and the step upon the Ghost ’ s Walk was so constant and so solemn that I never heard the like in all these years .
Night after night , as it has fallen dark , the sound has echoed through your rooms , but last night it was <unk> .
And as it fell dark last night , my Lady , I got this letter . ” “ What letter is it ? ” “ Hush !
Hush ! ” The housekeeper looks round and answers in a frightened whisper , “ My Lady , I have not breathed a word of it , I don ’ t believe what ’ s written in it , I know it can ’ t be true , I am sure and certain that it is not true .
But my son is in danger , and you must have a heart to pity me .
If you know of anything that is not known to others , if you have any suspicion , if you have any clue at all , and any reason for keeping it in your own breast , oh , my dear Lady , think of me , and conquer that reason , and let it be known !
This is the most I consider possible .
I know you are not a hard lady , but you go your own way always without help , and you are not familiar with your friends ; and all who admire you — and all do — as a beautiful and elegant lady , know you to be one far away from themselves who can ’ t be approached close .
My Lady , you may have some proud or angry reasons for <unk> to utter something that you know ; if so , pray , oh , pray , think of a faithful servant whose whole life has been passed in this family which she dearly loves , and <unk> , and help to clear my son !
My Lady , my good Lady , ” the old housekeeper <unk> with genuine simplicity , “ I am so humble in my place and you are by nature so high and distant that you may not think what I feel for my child , but I feel so much that I have come here to make so bold as to beg and pray you not to be <unk> of us if you can do us any right or justice at this fearful time ! ” Lady Dedlock <unk> her without one word , until she takes the letter from her hand .
“ Am I to read this ? ” “ When I am gone , my Lady , if you please , and then remembering the most that I consider possible . ” “ I know of nothing I can do .
I know of nothing I reserve that can <unk> your son .
I have never accused him . ” “ My Lady , you may pity him the more under a false <unk> after reading the letter . ” The old housekeeper leaves her with the letter in her hand .
In truth she is not a hard lady naturally , and the time has been when the sight of the venerable figure <unk> to her with such strong earnestness would have moved her to great compassion .
But so long accustomed to <unk> emotion and keep down reality , so long <unk> for her own purposes in that <unk> school which shuts up the natural feelings of the heart like flies in <unk> and <unk> one uniform and dreary <unk> over the good and bad , the feeling and the <unk> , the sensible and the <unk> , she had subdued even her wonder until now .
She opens the letter .
<unk> out upon the paper is a printed account of the discovery of the body as it lay face downward on the floor , shot through the heart ; and underneath is written her own name , with the word “ <unk> ” attached .
It falls out of her hand .
How long it may have <unk> upon the ground she knows not , but it lies where it fell when a servant stands before her announcing the young man of the name of Guppy .
The words have probably been repeated several times , for they are ringing in her head before she begins to understand them .
“ Let him come in ! ” He comes in .
<unk> the letter in her hand , which she has taken from the floor , she tries to <unk> her thoughts .
In the eyes of Mr. Guppy she is the same Lady Dedlock , holding the same prepared , proud , <unk> state .
“ Your ladyship may not be at first disposed to excuse this visit from one who has never been welcome to your ladyship ” — which he don ’ t complain of , for he is bound to confess that there never has been any particular reason on the face of things why he should be — “ but I hope when I mention my motives to your ladyship you will not find fault with me , ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ Do so . ” “ Thank your ladyship .
I ought first to explain to your ladyship , ” Mr. Guppy sits on the <unk> of a chair and puts his hat on the carpet at his feet , “ that Miss Summerson , whose image , as I formerly mentioned to your ladyship , was at one period of my life imprinted on my ’ eart until <unk> by circumstances over which I had no control , communicated to me , after I had the pleasure of waiting on your ladyship last , that she particularly wished me to take no steps whatever in any manner at all <unk> to her .
And Miss Summerson ’ s wishes being to me a law ( except as connected with circumstances over which I have no control ) , I consequently never expected to have the distinguished honour of waiting on your ladyship again . ” And yet he is here now , Lady Dedlock moodily <unk> him .
“ And yet I am here now , ” Mr. Guppy admits .
“ My object being to communicate to your ladyship , under the seal of confidence , why I am here . ” He cannot do so , she tells him , too plainly or too briefly .
“ Nor can I , ” Mr. Guppy returns with a sense of injury upon him , “ too particularly request your ladyship to take particular notice that it ’ s no personal affair of mine that brings me here .
I have no interested views of my own to serve in coming here .
If it was not for my promise to Miss Summerson and my keeping of it sacred — I , in point of fact , shouldn ’ t have darkened these doors again , but should have seen ’ em further first . ” Mr. Guppy considers this a favourable moment for sticking up his hair with both hands .
“ Your ladyship will remember when I mention it that the last time I was here I run against a party very eminent in our profession and whose loss we all <unk> .
That party certainly did from that time apply himself to cutting in against me in a way that I will call sharp practice , and did make it , at every turn and point , extremely difficult for me to be sure that I hadn ’ t <unk> led up to something contrary to Miss Summerson ’ s wishes .
<unk> is no <unk> , but I may say for myself that I am not so bad a man of business neither . ” Lady Dedlock looks at him in stern inquiry .
Mr. Guppy immediately withdraws his eyes from her face and looks anywhere else .
“ Indeed , it has been made so hard , ” he goes on , “ to have any idea what that party was up to in <unk> with others that until the loss which we all <unk> I was <unk> — an expression which your ladyship , moving in the higher circles , will be so good as to consider <unk> to knocked over .
Small likewise — a name by which I refer to another party , a friend of mine that your ladyship is not acquainted with — got to be so close and <unk> that at times it wasn ’ t easy to keep one ’ s hands off his ’ <unk> .
However , what with the exertion of my humble <unk> , and what with the help of a mutual friend by the name of Mr. Tony Weevle ( who is of a high aristocratic turn and has your ladyship ’ s portrait always hanging up in his room ) , I have now reasons for an apprehension as to which I come to put your ladyship upon your guard .
First , will your ladyship allow me to ask you whether you have had any strange visitors this morning ?
I don ’ t mean fashionable visitors , but such visitors , for instance , as Miss Barbary ’ s old servant , or as a person without the use of his lower <unk> , carried upstairs <unk> to a <unk> ? ” “ No ! ” “ Then I assure your ladyship that such visitors have been here and have been received here .
Because I saw them at the door , and waited at the corner of the square till they came out , and took half an hour ’ s turn afterwards to avoid them . ” “ What have I to do with that , or what have you ?
I do not understand you .
What do you mean ? ” “ Your ladyship , I come to put you on your guard .
There may be no occasion for it .
Very well .
Then I have only done my best to keep my promise to Miss Summerson .
I strongly suspect ( from what Small has dropped , and from what we have <unk> out of him ) that those letters I was to have brought to your ladyship were not destroyed when I supposed they were .
That if there was anything to be blown upon , it IS blown upon .
That the visitors I have <unk> to have been here this morning to make money of it .
And that the money is made , or making . ” Mr. Guppy <unk> up his hat and rises .
“ Your ladyship , you know best whether there ’ s anything in what I say or whether there ’ s nothing .
Something or nothing , I have <unk> up to Miss Summerson ’ s wishes in letting things alone and in <unk> what I had begun to do , as far as possible ; that ’ s sufficient for me .
In case I should be taking a liberty in putting your ladyship on your guard when there ’ s no necessity for it , you will endeavour , I should hope , to <unk> my <unk> , and I shall endeavour to <unk> your <unk> .
I now take my farewell of your ladyship , and assure you that there ’ s no danger of your ever being waited on by me again . ” She scarcely <unk> these parting words by any look , but when he has been gone a little while , she rings her bell .
“ Where is Sir Leicester ? ” Mercury reports that he is at present shut up in the library alone .
“ Has Sir Leicester had any visitors this morning ? ” Several , on business .
Mercury proceeds to a description of them , which has been anticipated by Mr. Guppy .
<unk> ; he may go .
So !
All is broken down .
Her name is in these many <unk> , her husband knows his wrongs , her shame will be published — may be <unk> while she thinks about it — and in addition to the <unk> so long <unk> by her , so <unk> by him , she is <unk> by an <unk> <unk> as the <unk> of her enemy .
Her enemy he was , and she has often , often , often wished him dead .
Her enemy he is , even in his grave .
This dreadful <unk> comes upon her like a new <unk> at his <unk> hand .
And when she recalls how she was secretly at his door that night , and how she may be represented to have sent her favourite girl away so soon before merely to release herself from observation , she <unk> as if the <unk> ’ s hands were at her neck .
She has thrown herself upon the floor and lies with her hair all <unk> scattered and her face buried in the <unk> of a couch .
She rises up , hurries to and fro , <unk> herself down again , and <unk> and <unk> .
The horror that is upon her is <unk> .
If she really were the <unk> , it could hardly be , for the moment , more intense .
For as her murderous perspective , before the doing of the deed , however <unk> the precautions for its commission , would have been closed up by a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> figure , <unk> her from seeing any consequences beyond it ; and as those consequences would have <unk> in , in an <unk> <unk> , the moment the figure was laid low — which always happens when a murder is done ; so , now she sees that when he used to be on the watch before her , and she used to think , “ if some mortal <unk> would but fall on this old man and take him from my way ! ” it was but <unk> that all he held against her in his hand might be <unk> to the winds and <unk> in many places .
So , too , with the wicked relief she has felt in his death .
What was his death but the <unk> of a gloomy arch removed , and now the arch begins to fall in a thousand fragments , each crushing and <unk> <unk> !
Thus , a terrible impression <unk> upon and <unk> her that from this <unk> , living or dead — <unk> and imperturbable before her in his <unk> shape , or not more <unk> and imperturbable in his <unk> — there is no escape but in death .
<unk> , she flies .
The <unk> of her shame , her dread , remorse , and misery , <unk> her at its height ; and even her strength of <unk> is <unk> and <unk> away like a leaf before a mighty wind .
She hurriedly addresses these lines to her husband , <unk> , and leaves them on her table : If I am sought for , or accused of , his murder , believe that I am wholly innocent .
<unk> no other good of me , for I am innocent of nothing else that you have heard , or will hear , laid to my charge .
He prepared me , on that fatal night , for his <unk> of my <unk> to you .
After he had left me , I went out on pretence of walking in the garden where I sometimes walk , but really to follow him and make one last <unk> that he would not <unk> the dreadful suspense on which I have been <unk> by him , you do not know how long , but would <unk> strike next morning .
I found his house dark and silent .
I rang twice at his door , but there was no reply , and I came home .
I have no home left .
I will <unk> you no more .
May you , in your just <unk> , be able to forget the <unk> woman on whom you have <unk> a most generous devotion — who <unk> you only with a deeper shame than that with which she hurries from herself — and who writes this last <unk> .
She <unk> and dresses quickly , leaves all her <unk> and her money , listens , goes downstairs at a moment when the hall is empty , opens and shuts the great door , <unk> away in the shrill frosty wind .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> <unk> , as <unk> its high <unk> , the Dedlock town house stares at the other houses in the street of dismal grandeur and gives no outward sign of anything going wrong within .
<unk> rattle , doors are <unk> at , the world <unk> calls ; ancient <unk> with skeleton throats , and <unk> cheeks that have a rather <unk> bloom upon them seen by daylight , when indeed these fascinating creatures look like Death and the Lady <unk> together , <unk> the eyes of men .
<unk> from the <unk> <unk> come easily swinging carriages guided by <unk> <unk> in <unk> wigs , deep sunk into <unk> <unk> , and up behind mount <unk> Mercuries bearing sticks of state and wearing <unk> <unk> <unk> , a spectacle for the angels .
The Dedlock town house changes not <unk> , and hours pass before its <unk> <unk> is disturbed within .
But Volumnia the fair , being subject to the <unk> complaint of <unk> and finding that disorder <unk> her spirits with some <unk> , ventures at length to repair to the library for change of scene .
Her gentle tapping at the door producing no <unk> , she opens it and peeps in ; seeing no one there , takes possession .
The sprightly Dedlock is <unk> , in that <unk> city of the <unk> , Bath , to be <unk> by an <unk> curiosity which <unk> her on all convenient and inconvenient occasions to <unk> about with a golden glass at her eye , <unk> into objects of every description .
<unk> it is that she <unk> herself of the present opportunity of hovering over her kinsman ’ s letters and papers like a bird , taking a short <unk> at this document and a <unk> with her head on one side at that document , and hopping about from table to table with her glass at her eye in an inquisitive and restless manner .
In the course of these <unk> she <unk> over something , and turning her glass in that direction , sees her kinsman lying on the ground like a <unk> tree .
Volumnia ’ s pet little scream <unk> a considerable <unk> of reality from this surprise , and the house is quickly in <unk> .
<unk> tear up and down stairs , bells are violently rung , <unk> are sent for , and Lady Dedlock is sought in all directions , but not found .
Nobody has seen or heard her since she last rang her bell .
Her letter to Sir Leicester is discovered on her table , but it is doubtful yet whether he has not received another <unk> from another world <unk> to be personally answered , and all the living <unk> , and all the dead , are as one to him .
They lay him down upon his bed , and <unk> , and rub , and <unk> , and put <unk> to his head , and try every means of <unk> .
<unk> , the day has <unk> away , and it is night in his room before his <unk> breathing <unk> or his fixed eyes show any consciousness of the candle that is occasionally passed before them .
But when this change begins , it goes on ; and by and by he nods or moves his eyes or even his hand in <unk> that he hears and <unk> .
He fell down , this morning , a handsome stately gentleman , somewhat <unk> , but of a fine presence , and with a <unk> face .
He lies upon his bed , an aged man with <unk> cheeks , the <unk> shadow of himself .
His voice was rich and <unk> and he had so long been thoroughly persuaded of the weight and <unk> to mankind of any word he said that his words really had come to sound as if there were something in them .
But now he can only whisper , and what he whispers sounds like what it is — mere <unk> and <unk> .
His favourite and faithful housekeeper stands at his bedside .
It is the first act he <unk> , and he clearly <unk> pleasure from it .
After <unk> trying to make himself understood in speech , he makes signs for a pencil .
So <unk> that they cannot at first understand him ; it is his old housekeeper who makes out what he wants and brings in a slate .
After pausing for some time , he slowly <unk> upon it in a hand that is not his , “ Chesney Wold ? ” No , she tells him ; he is in London .
He was taken ill in the library this morning .
Right thankful she is that she happened to come to London and is able to attend upon him .
“ It is not an illness of any serious consequence , Sir Leicester .
You will be much better to-morrow , Sir Leicester .
All the gentlemen say so . ” This , with the tears <unk> down her fair old face .
After making a <unk> of the room and looking with particular attention all round the bed where the <unk> stand , he writes , “ My Lady . ” “ My Lady went out , Sir Leicester , before you were taken ill , and don ’ t know of your illness yet . ” He points again , in great agitation , at the two words .
They all try to quiet him , but he points again with increased agitation .
On their looking at one another , not knowing what to say , he takes the slate once more and writes “ My Lady .
For God ’ s sake , where ? ” And makes an imploring <unk> .
It is thought better that his old housekeeper should give him Lady Dedlock ’ s letter , the contents of which no one knows or can <unk> .
She opens it for him and puts it out for his <unk> .
Having read it twice by a great effort , he turns it down so that it shall not be seen and lies <unk> .
He passes into a kind of <unk> or into a <unk> , and it is an hour before he opens his eyes , <unk> on his faithful and attached old servant ’ s arm .
The <unk> know that he is best with her , and when not <unk> engaged about him , stand <unk> .
The slate comes into <unk> again , but the word he wants to write he cannot remember .
His anxiety , his <unk> , and affliction at this pass are <unk> to behold .
It seems as if he must go mad in the necessity he feels for haste and the <unk> under which he labours of expressing to do what or to fetch whom .
He has written the letter <unk> , and there stopped .
Of a sudden , in the height of his misery , he puts Mr. before it .
The old housekeeper suggests Bucket .
Thank heaven !
That ’ s his meaning .
Mr. Bucket is found to be downstairs , by appointment .
Shall he come up ?
There is no possibility of <unk> Sir Leicester ’ s burning wish to see him or the desire he <unk> to have the room cleared of every one but the housekeeper .
It is <unk> done , and Mr. Bucket appears .
Of all men upon earth , Sir Leicester seems fallen from his high estate to place his sole trust and reliance upon this man .
“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I ’ m sorry to see you like this .
I hope you ’ ll cheer up .
I ’ m sure you will , on account of the family credit . ” Sir Leicester puts her letter in his hands and looks <unk> in his face while he reads it .
A new intelligence comes into Mr. Bucket ’ s eye as he reads on ; with one hook of his finger , while that eye is still glancing over the words , he <unk> , “ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I understand you . ” Sir Leicester writes upon the slate .
“ <unk> forgiveness .
<unk> — ” Mr. Bucket stops his hand .
“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I ’ ll find her .
But my search after her must be begun out of hand .
Not a minute must be lost . ” With the quickness of thought , he follows Sir Leicester Dedlock ’ s look towards a little box upon a table .
“ Bring it here , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ?
Certainly .
<unk> it with one of these here keys ?
Certainly .
The <unk> key ?
TO be sure .
Take the notes out ?
So I will .
<unk> ’ em ?
That ’ s soon done .
<unk> and thirty ’ s fifty , and twenty ’ s seventy , and fifty ’ s one twenty , and forty ’ s one <unk> .
Take ’ em for expenses ?
That I ’ ll do , and render an account of course .
Don ’ t spare money ?
No I won ’ t . ” The <unk> and certainty of Mr. Bucket ’ s <unk> on all these heads is little short of <unk> .
Mrs. Rouncewell , who holds the light , is giddy with the <unk> of his eyes and hands as he starts up , furnished for his journey .
“ You ’ re George ’ s mother , old lady ; that ’ s about what you are , I believe ? ” says Mr. Bucket aside , with his hat already on and <unk> his coat .
“ Yes , sir , I am his distressed mother . ” “ So I thought , according to what he mentioned to me just now .
Well , then , I ’ ll tell you something .
You needn ’ t be distressed no more .
Your son ’ s all right .
Now , don ’ t you begin <unk> , because what you ’ ve got to do is to take care of Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and you won ’ t do that by crying .
As to your son , he ’ s all right , I tell you ; and he sends his loving duty , and hoping you ’ re the same .
He ’ s discharged honourable ; that ’ s about what HE is ; with no more <unk> on his character than there is on yours , and yours is a tidy one , I ’ <unk> <unk> a pound .
You may trust me , for I took your son .
He conducted himself in a game way , too , on that occasion ; and he ’ s a <unk> man , and you ’ re a <unk> old lady , and you ’ re a mother and son , the pair of you , as might be showed for <unk> in a <unk> .
Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , what you ’ ve trusted to me I ’ ll go through with .
Don ’ t you be afraid of my turning out of my way , right or left , or taking a sleep , or a <unk> , or a <unk> till I have found what I go in search of .
Say everything as is kind and <unk> on your part ?
Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I will .
And I wish you better , and these family affairs <unk> over — as , Lord , many other family affairs equally has been , and equally will be , to the end of time . ” With this <unk> , Mr. Bucket , buttoned up , goes quietly out , looking steadily before him as if he were already <unk> the night in <unk> of the <unk> .
His first step is to take himself to Lady Dedlock ’ s rooms and look all over them for any trifling indication that may help him .
The rooms are in darkness now ; and to see Mr. Bucket with a <unk> in his hand , holding it above his head and taking a sharp mental <unk> of the many delicate objects so curiously at <unk> with himself , would be to see a sight — which nobody <unk> see , as he is particular to lock himself in .
“ A <unk> <unk> , this , ” says Mr. Bucket , who feels in a manner <unk> up in his French by the blow of the morning .
“ <unk> have cost a sight of money .
<unk> articles to cut away from , these ; she must have been hard put to it ! ” <unk> and shutting <unk> and looking into <unk> and <unk> , he sees the reflection of himself in various mirrors , and <unk> <unk> .
“ One might suppose I was a-moving in the fashionable circles and getting myself up for <unk> ’ s , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ I begin to think I must be a swell in the <unk> without knowing it . ” <unk> looking about , he has opened a <unk> little chest in an inner drawer .
His great hand , turning over some gloves which it can scarcely feel , they are so light and soft within it , comes upon a white handkerchief .
“ Hum !
Let ’ s have a look at YOU , ” says Mr. Bucket , putting down the light .
“ What should YOU be kept by yourself for ?
What ’ s YOUR <unk> ?
Are you her ladyship ’ s property , or somebody else ’ s ?
You ’ ve got a mark upon you somewheres or another , I suppose ? ” He finds it as he speaks , “ Esther Summerson . ” “ Oh ! ” says Mr. Bucket , pausing , with his finger at his ear .
“ Come , I ’ ll take YOU . ” He <unk> his observations as quietly and carefully as he has carried them on , leaves everything else <unk> as he found it , glides away after some five minutes in all , and passes into the street .
With a glance upward at the dimly lighted windows of Sir Leicester ’ s room , he sets off , <unk> , to the nearest <unk> , <unk> out the horse for his money , and directs to be driven to the shooting gallery .
Mr. Bucket does not claim to be a <unk> judge of horses , but he lays out a little money on the principal events in that line , and generally <unk> up his knowledge of the subject in the remark that when he sees a horse as can go , he knows him .
His knowledge is not at fault in the present instance .
<unk> over the stones at a dangerous pace , yet thoughtfully bringing his keen eyes to bear on every <unk> creature whom he passes in the midnight streets , and even on the lights in upper windows where people are going or gone to bed , and on all the <unk> that he rattles by , and alike on the heavy sky , and on the earth where the snow lies thin — for something may present itself to assist him , anywhere — he <unk> to his destination at such a speed that when he stops the horse half <unk> him in a cloud of <unk> .
“ <unk> him half a moment to <unk> him up , and I ’ ll be back . ” He runs up the long wooden entry and finds the trooper smoking his pipe .
“ I thought I should , George , after what you have gone through , my lad .
I haven ’ t a word to spare .
Now , honour !
All to save a woman .
Miss Summerson that was here when Gridley died — that was the name , I know — all right — where does she live ? ” The trooper has just come from there and gives him the address , near <unk> Street .
“ You won ’ t <unk> it , George .
Good night ! ” He is off again , with an impression of having seen Phil sitting by the frosty fire staring at him <unk> , and <unk> away again , and gets out in a cloud of <unk> again .
Mr. Jarndyce , the only person up in the house , is just going to bed , rises from his book on hearing the rapid ringing at the bell , and comes down to the door in his <unk> .
“ Don ’ t be alarmed , sir . ” In a moment his visitor is confidential with him in the hall , has shut the door , and stands with his hand upon the lock .
“ I ’ ve had the pleasure of seeing you before .
Inspector Bucket .
Look at that handkerchief , sir , Miss Esther Summerson ’ s .
<unk> it myself put away in a drawer of Lady Dedlock ’ s , quarter of an hour ago .
Not a moment to lose .
<unk> of life or death .
You know Lady Dedlock ? ” “ Yes . ” “ There has been a discovery there to-day .
Family affairs have come out .
Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , has had a fit — <unk> or <unk> — and couldn ’ t be brought to , and precious time has been lost .
Lady Dedlock disappeared this afternoon and left a letter for him that looks bad .
<unk> your eye over it .
Here it is ! ” Mr. Jarndyce , having read it , asks him what he thinks .
“ I don ’ t know .
It looks like <unk> .
<unk> , there ’ s more and more danger , every minute , of its drawing to that .
I ’ d give a hundred pound an hour to have got the start of the present time .
Now , Mr. Jarndyce , I am employed by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , to follow her and find her , to save her and take her his forgiveness .
I have money and full power , but I want something else .
I want Miss Summerson . ” Mr. Jarndyce in a troubled voice repeats , “ Miss Summerson ? ” “ Now , Mr. Jarndyce ” — Mr.
Bucket has read his face with the greatest attention all along — “ I speak to you as a gentleman of a <unk> heart , and under such pressing circumstances as don ’ t often happen .
If ever delay was dangerous , it ’ s dangerous now ; and if ever you couldn ’ t afterwards forgive yourself for <unk> it , this is the time .
<unk> or ten hours , worth , as I tell you , a hundred pound <unk> at least , have been lost since Lady Dedlock disappeared .
I am charged to find her .
I am Inspector Bucket .
Besides all the rest that ’ s heavy on her , she has upon her , as she believes , suspicion of murder .
If I follow her alone , she , being in ignorance of what Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , has communicated to me , may be driven to <unk> .
But if I follow her in company with a young lady , answering to the description of a young lady that she has a tenderness for — I ask no question , and I say no more than that — she will give me credit for being friendly .
Let me come up with her and be able to have the hold upon her of putting that young lady for ’ ard , and I ’ ll save her and <unk> with her if she is alive .
Let me come up with her alone — a hard matter — and I ’ ll do my best , but I don ’ t answer for what the best may be .
Time flies ; it ’ s getting on for one o ’ clock .
When one strikes , there ’ s another hour gone , and it ’ s worth a thousand pound now instead of a hundred . ” This is all true , and the pressing nature of the case cannot be <unk> .
Mr. Jarndyce begs him to remain there while he speaks to Miss Summerson .
Mr. Bucket says he will , but <unk> on his usual principle , does no such thing , following upstairs instead and keeping his man in sight .
So he remains , <unk> and <unk> about in the gloom of the staircase while they confer .
In a very little time Mr. Jarndyce comes down and tells him that Miss Summerson will join him directly and place herself under his protection to accompany him where he <unk> .
Mr. Bucket , satisfied , expresses high approval and <unk> her coming at the door .
There he <unk> a high tower in his mind and looks out far and wide .
Many solitary figures he perceives creeping through the streets ; many solitary figures out on <unk> , and roads , and lying under <unk> .
But the figure that he <unk> is not among them .
Other <unk> he perceives , in <unk> of bridges , looking over ; and in <unk> places down by the river ’ s level ; and a dark , dark , <unk> object <unk> with the <unk> , more solitary than all , <unk> with a <unk> hold on his attention .
Where is she ?
<unk> or dead , where is she ?
If , as he folds the handkerchief and carefully puts it up , it were able with an enchanted power to bring before him the place where she found it and the <unk> near the cottage where it covered the little child , would he <unk> her there ?
On the waste where the <unk> are burning with a pale blue <unk> , where the <unk> of the wretched <unk> in which the bricks are made are being scattered by the wind , where the <unk> and water are hard frozen and the mill in which the gaunt blind horse goes round all day looks like an instrument of human <unk> — <unk> this deserted , blighted spot there is a lonely figure with the sad world to itself , <unk> by the snow and driven by the wind , and cast out , it would seem , from all <unk> .
It is the figure of a woman , too ; but it is <unk> dressed , and no such clothes ever came through the hall and out at the great door of the Dedlock mansion .
CHAPTER <unk> Esther ’ s Narrative I had gone to bed and fallen asleep when my guardian knocked at the door of my room and begged me to get up directly .
On my <unk> to speak to him and learn what had happened , he told me , after a word or two of preparation , that there had been a discovery at Sir Leicester Dedlock ’ s .
That my mother had <unk> , that a person was now at our door who was <unk> to <unk> to her the <unk> assurances of affectionate protection and forgiveness if he could possibly find her , and that I was sought for to accompany him in the hope that my entreaties might <unk> upon her if his failed .
Something to this general purpose I made out , but I was thrown into such a <unk> of alarm , and hurry and distress , that in spite of every effort I could make to <unk> my agitation , I did not seem , to myself , fully to recover my right mind until hours had passed .
But I dressed and wrapped up <unk> without waking Charley or any one and went down to Mr. Bucket , who was the person <unk> with the secret .
In taking me to him my guardian told me this , and also explained how it was that he had come to think of me .
Mr. Bucket , in a low voice , by the light of my guardian ’ s candle , read to me in the hall a letter that my mother had left upon her table ; and I suppose within ten minutes of my having been aroused I was sitting beside him , rolling swiftly through the streets .
His manner was very keen , and yet considerate when he explained to me that a great deal might depend on my being able to answer , without confusion , a few questions that he wished to ask me .
These were , chiefly , whether I had had much communication with my mother ( to whom he only referred as Lady Dedlock ) , when and where I had spoken with her last , and how she had become possessed of my handkerchief .
When I had satisfied him on these points , he asked me particularly to consider — taking time to think — whether within my knowledge there was any one , no matter where , in whom she might be at all likely to confide under circumstances of the last necessity .
I could think of no one but my guardian .
But by and by I mentioned Mr. Boythorn .
He came into my mind as connected with his old <unk> manner of mentioning my mother ’ s name and with what my guardian had informed me of his engagement to her sister and his unconscious connexion with her unhappy story .
My companion had stopped the driver while we held this conversation , that we might the better hear each other .
He now told him to go on again and said to me , after considering within himself for a few moments , that he had made up his mind how to proceed .
He was quite willing to tell me what his plan was , but I did not feel clear enough to understand it .
We had not driven very far from our lodgings when we stopped in a <unk> at a <unk> place lighted up with gas .
Mr. Bucket took me in and sat me in an arm-chair by a bright fire .
It was now past one , as I saw by the clock against the wall .
Two police officers , looking in their perfectly neat uniform not at all like people who were up all night , were quietly writing at a desk ; and the place seemed very quiet altogether , except for some beating and calling out at distant doors <unk> , to which nobody paid any attention .
A third man in uniform , whom Mr. Bucket called and to whom he whispered his instructions , went out ; and then the two others advised together while one wrote from Mr. Bucket ’ s subdued <unk> .
It was a description of my mother that they were busy with , for Mr. Bucket brought it to me when it was done and read it in a whisper .
It was very <unk> indeed .
The second officer , who had attended to it closely , then copied it out and called in another man in uniform ( there were several in an outer room ) , who took it up and went away with it .
All this was done with the greatest dispatch and without the waste of a moment ; yet nobody was at all hurried .
As soon as the paper was sent out upon its <unk> , the two officers resumed their former quiet work of writing with <unk> and care .
Mr. Bucket thoughtfully came and warmed the <unk> of his boots , first one and then the other , at the fire .
“ Are you well wrapped up , Miss Summerson ? ” he asked me as his eyes met mine .
“ It ’ s a desperate sharp night for a young lady to be out in . ” I told him I cared for no weather and was <unk> <unk> .
“ It may be a long job , ” he observed ; “ but so that it ends well , never mind , miss . ” “ I pray to heaven it may end well ! ” said I.
He nodded <unk> .
“ You see , whatever you do , don ’ t you go and <unk> yourself .
You keep yourself cool and equal for anything that may happen , and it ’ ll be the better for you , the better for me , the better for Lady Dedlock , and the better for Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . ” He was really very kind and gentle , and as he stood before the fire <unk> his boots and rubbing his face with his forefinger , I felt a confidence in his <unk> which reassured me .
It was not yet a quarter to two when I heard horses ’ feet and wheels outside .
“ Now , Miss Summerson , ” said he , “ we are off , if you please ! ” He gave me his arm , and the two officers <unk> bowed me out , and we found at the door a <unk> or <unk> with a <unk> and post horses .
Mr. Bucket handed me in and took his own seat on the box .
The man in uniform whom he had sent to fetch this <unk> then handed him up a dark lantern at his request , and when he had given a few directions to the driver , we rattled away .
I was far from sure that I was not in a dream .
We rattled with great <unk> through such a <unk> of streets that I soon lost all idea where we were , except that we had crossed and <unk> the river , and still seemed to be <unk> a <unk> , <unk> , dense neighbourhood of narrow <unk> <unk> by <unk> and <unk> , high piles of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> of ships .
At length we stopped at the corner of a little <unk> turning , which the wind from the river , rushing up it , did not <unk> ; and I saw my companion , by the light of his lantern , in conference with several men who looked like a mixture of police and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> wall by which they stood , there was a bill , on which I could <unk> the words , “ <unk> <unk> ” ; and this and an inscription about <unk> possessed me with the awful suspicion <unk> forth in our visit to that place .
I had no need to remind myself that I was not there by the <unk> of any feeling of mine to <unk> the difficulties of the search , or to <unk> its hopes , or <unk> its <unk> .
I remained quiet , but what I suffered in that dreadful spot I never can forget .
And still it was like the horror of a dream .
A man yet dark and muddy , in long <unk> <unk> boots and a hat like them , was called out of a <unk> and whispered with Mr. Bucket , who went away with him down some <unk> steps — as if to look at something secret that he had to show .
They came back , wiping their hands upon their coats , after turning over something wet ; but thank God it was not what I feared !
After some further conference , Mr. Bucket ( whom everybody seemed to know and <unk> to ) went in with the others at a door and left me in the carriage , while the driver walked up and down by his horses to warm himself .
The <unk> was coming in , as I <unk> from the sound it made , and I could hear it break at the end of the <unk> with a little rush towards me .
It never did so — and I thought it did so , hundreds of times , in what can have been at the most a quarter of an hour , and probably was less — but the thought <unk> through me that it would cast my mother at the horses ’ feet .
Mr. Bucket came out again , <unk> the others to be <unk> , darkened his lantern , and once more took his seat .
“ Don ’ t you be alarmed , Miss Summerson , on account of our coming down here , ” he said , turning to me .
“ I only want to have everything in train and to know that it is in train by looking after it myself .
Get on , my lad ! ” We appeared to <unk> the way we had come .
Not that I had taken note of any particular objects in my <unk> state of mind , but judging from the general character of the streets .
We called at another office or station for a minute and crossed the river again .
During the whole of this time , and during the whole search , my companion , wrapped up on the box , never <unk> in his <unk> a single moment ; but when we crossed the bridge he seemed , if possible , to be more on the <unk> than before .
He stood up to look over the parapet , he alighted and went back after a shadowy female figure that <unk> past us , and he <unk> into the profound black pit of water with a face that made my heart die within me .
The river had a fearful look , so <unk> and secret , creeping away so fast between the low flat lines of shore — so heavy with indistinct and awful shapes , both of substance and shadow ; so <unk> and mysterious .
I have seen it many times since then , by sunlight and by moonlight , but never free from the impressions of that journey .
In my memory the lights upon the bridge are always burning dim , the cutting wind is <unk> round the <unk> woman whom we pass , the monotonous wheels are <unk> on , and the light of the <unk> reflected back looks <unk> in upon me — a face rising out of the <unk> water .
<unk> and <unk> through the empty streets , we came at length from the pavement on to dark smooth roads and began to leave the houses behind us .
After a while I recognized the familiar way to Saint Albans .
At <unk> fresh horses were ready for us , and we changed and went on .
It was very cold indeed , and the open country was white with snow , though none was falling then .
“ An old acquaintance of yours , this road , Miss Summerson , ” said Mr. Bucket cheerfully .
“ Yes , ” I returned .
“ Have you gathered any intelligence ? ” “ None that can be quite <unk> on as yet , ” he answered , “ but it ’ s early times as yet . ” He had gone into every late or early public-house where there was a light ( they were not a few at that time , the road being then much <unk> by <unk> ) and had got down to talk to the <unk> .
I had heard him <unk> drink , and <unk> money , and making himself agreeable and merry everywhere ; but whenever he took his seat upon the box again , his face resumed its watchful steady look , and he always said to the driver in the same business tone , “ Get on , my lad ! ” With all these <unk> , it was between five and six o ’ clock and we were yet a few miles short of Saint Albans when he came out of one of these houses and handed me in a cup of tea .
“ <unk> it , Miss Summerson , it ’ ll do you good .
You ’ re beginning to get more yourself now , ain ’ t you ? ” I thanked him and said I hoped so .
“ You was what you may call <unk> at first , ” he returned ; “ and Lord , no wonder !
Don ’ t speak loud , my dear .
It ’ s all right .
She ’ s on <unk> . ” I don ’ t know what joyful exclamation I made or was going to make , but he put up his finger and I stopped myself .
“ <unk> through here on foot this evening about eight or nine .
I heard of her first at the archway <unk> , over at <unk> , but couldn ’ t make quite sure .
<unk> her all along , on and off .
<unk> her up at one place , and dropped her at another ; but she ’ s before us now , safe .
Take hold of this cup and <unk> , <unk> .
Now , if you wasn ’ t brought up to the butter trade , look out and see if you can catch half a crown in your t ’ other hand .
One , two , three , and there you are !
Now , my lad , try a <unk> ! ” We were soon in Saint Albans and alighted a little before day , when I was just beginning to arrange and comprehend the occurrences of the night and really to believe that they were not a dream .
Leaving the carriage at the <unk> and <unk> fresh horses to be ready , my companion gave me his arm , and we went towards home .
“ As this is your regular <unk> , Miss Summerson , you see , ” he observed , “ I should like to know whether you ’ ve been asked for by any stranger answering the description , or whether Mr. Jarndyce has .
I don ’ t much expect it , but it might be . ” As we <unk> the hill , he looked about him with a sharp eye — the day was now breaking — and reminded me that I had come down it one night , as I had reason for remembering , with my little servant and poor Jo , whom he called Toughey .
I wondered how he knew that .
“ When you passed a man upon the road , just yonder , you know , ” said Mr. Bucket .
Yes , I remembered that too , very well .
“ That was me , ” said Mr. Bucket .
<unk> my surprise , he went on , “ I drove down in a gig that afternoon to look after that boy .
You might have heard my wheels when you came out to look after him yourself , for I was aware of you and your little maid going up when I was walking the horse down .
<unk> an inquiry or two about him in the town , I soon heard what company he was in and was coming among the <unk> to look for him when I observed you bringing him home here . ” “ <unk> he committed any crime ? ” I asked .
“ None was charged against him , ” said Mr. Bucket , coolly lifting off his hat , “ but I suppose he wasn ’ t <unk> .
No .
What I wanted him for was in connexion with keeping this very matter of Lady Dedlock quiet .
He had been making his tongue more free than welcome as to a small accidental service he had been paid for by the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn ; and it wouldn ’ t do , at any sort of price , to have him playing those games .
So having <unk> him out of London , I made an afternoon of it to warn him to keep out of it now he WAS away , and go farther from it , and maintain a bright <unk> that I didn ’ t catch him coming back again . ” “ Poor creature ! ” said I.
“ Poor enough , ” assented Mr. Bucket , “ and trouble enough , and well enough away from London , or anywhere else .
I was regularly turned on my back when I found him taken up by your establishment , I do assure you . ” I asked him why .
“ Why , my dear ? ” said Mr. Bucket .
“ <unk> there was no end to his tongue then .
He might as well have been born with a yard and a half of it , and a <unk> over . ” Although I remember this conversation now , my head was in confusion at the time , and my power of attention hardly did more than <unk> me to understand that he entered into these particulars to <unk> me .
With the same kind intention , <unk> , he often spoke to me of indifferent things , while his face was busy with the one object that we had in view .
He still pursued this subject as we turned in at the <unk> .
“ Ah ! ” said Mr. Bucket .
“ Here we are , and a nice retired place it is .
<unk> a man in mind of the country house in the <unk> , that was known by the smoke which so <unk> <unk> .
They ’ re early with the kitchen fire , and that <unk> good servants .
But what you ’ ve always got to be careful of with servants is who comes to see ’ em ; you never know what they ’ re up to if you don ’ t know that .
And another thing , my dear .
Whenever you find a young man behind the <unk> , you give that young man in charge on suspicion of being <unk> in a <unk> with an <unk> purpose . ” We were now in front of the house ; he looked attentively and closely at the <unk> for <unk> before he raised his eyes to the windows .
“ Do you generally put that <unk> young gentleman in the same room when he ’ s on a visit here , Miss Summerson ? ” he inquired , glancing at Mr. Skimpole ’ s usual chamber .
“ You know Mr. Skimpole ! ” said I.
“ What do you call him again ? ” returned Mr. Bucket , bending down his ear .
“ Skimpole , is it ?
I ’ ve often wondered what his name might be .
Skimpole .
Not John , I should say , nor yet <unk> ? ” “ Harold , ” I told him .
“ Harold .
Yes .
He ’ s a queer bird is Harold , ” said Mr. Bucket , eyeing me with great expression .
“ He is a singular character , ” said I.
“ No idea of money , ” observed Mr. Bucket .
“ He takes it , though ! ” I <unk> returned for answer that I perceived Mr. Bucket knew him .
“ Why , now I ’ ll tell you , Miss Summerson , ” he replied .
“ Your mind will be all the better for not running on one point too continually , and I ’ ll tell you for a change .
It was him as pointed out to me where Toughey was .
I made up my mind that night to come to the door and ask for Toughey , if that was all ; but willing to try a move or so first , if any such was on the board , I just <unk> up a morsel of <unk> at that window where I saw a shadow .
As soon as Harold opens it and I have had a look at him , thinks I , you ’ re the man for me .
So I <unk> him down a bit about not wanting to disturb the family after they was gone to bed and about its being a thing to be regretted that charitable young ladies should <unk> <unk> ; and then , when I pretty well understood his ways , I said I should consider a <unk> well bestowed if I could <unk> the premises of Toughey without <unk> any noise or trouble .
Then says he , lifting up his eyebrows in the <unk> way , ‘ It ’ s no use mentioning a <unk> to me , my friend , because I ’ m a mere child in such matters and have no idea of money . ’ Of course I understood what his taking it so easy meant ; and being now quite sure he was the man for me , I wrapped the note round a little stone and threw it up to him .
Well !
He laughs and <unk> , and looks as innocent as you like , and says , ‘ But I don ’ t know the value of these things .
What am I to DO with this ? ’ ‘ <unk> it , sir , ’ says I.
‘ But I shall be taken in , ’ he says , ‘ they won ’ t give me the right change , I shall lose it , it ’ s no use to me . ’ Lord , you never saw such a face as he carried it with !
Of course he told me where to find Toughey , and I found him . ” I regarded this as very <unk> on the part of Mr. Skimpole towards my guardian and as passing the usual <unk> of his childish innocence .
“ <unk> , my dear ? ” returned Mr. Bucket .
“ <unk> ?
Now , Miss Summerson , I ’ ll give you a piece of advice that your husband will find useful when you are happily married and have got a family about you .
Whenever a person says to you that they are as innocent as can be in all concerning money , look well after your own money , for they are dead certain to collar it if they can .
Whenever a person <unk> to you ‘ In worldly matters I ’ m a child , ’ you consider that that person is only <unk> off from being held <unk> and that you have got that person ’ s number , and it ’ s <unk> One .
Now , I am not a <unk> man myself , except in a <unk> way when it goes round a company , but I ’ m a practical one , and that ’ s my experience .
So ’ s this <unk> .
<unk> and loose in one thing , fast and loose in everything .
I never knew it fail .
No more will you .
Nor no one .
With which caution to the <unk> , my dear , I take the liberty of pulling this here bell , and so go back to our business . ” I believe it had not been for a moment out of his mind , any more than it had been out of my mind , or out of his face .
The whole household were amazed to see me , without any notice , at that time in the morning , and so accompanied ; and their surprise was not <unk> by my inquiries .
No one , however , had been there .
It could not be doubted that this was the truth .
“ Then , Miss Summerson , ” said my companion , “ we can ’ t be too soon at the cottage where those <unk> are to be found .
Most inquiries there I leave to you , if you ’ ll be so good as to make ’ em .
The <unk> way is the best way , and the <unk> way is your own way . ” We set off again immediately .
On arriving at the cottage , we found it shut up and apparently deserted , but one of the neighbours who knew me and who came out when I was trying to make some one hear informed me that the two women and their husbands now lived together in another house , made of loose rough bricks , which stood on the <unk> of the piece of ground where the <unk> were and where the long rows of bricks were drying .
We lost no time in <unk> to this place , which was within a few hundred yards ; and as the door stood <unk> , I pushed it open .
There were only three of them sitting at breakfast , the child lying asleep on a bed in the corner .
It was Jenny , the mother of the dead child , who was absent .
The other woman rose on seeing me ; and the men , though they were , as usual , sulky and silent , each gave me a <unk> nod of recognition .
A look passed between them when Mr. Bucket followed me in , and I was surprised to see that the woman evidently knew him .
I had asked leave to enter of course .
Liz ( the only name by which I knew her ) rose to give me her own chair , but I sat down on a stool near the fire , and Mr. Bucket took a corner of the bedstead .
Now that I had to speak and was among people with whom I was not familiar , I became conscious of being hurried and giddy .
It was very difficult to begin , and I could not help bursting into tears .
“ Liz , ” said I , “ I have come a long way in the night and through the snow to inquire after a lady — ” “ Who has been here , you know , ” Mr. Bucket struck in , addressing the whole <unk> with a composed <unk> face ; “ that ’ s the lady the young lady means .
The lady that was here last night , you know . ” “ And who told YOU as there was anybody here ? ” inquired Jenny ’ s husband , who had made a <unk> stop in his eating to listen and now <unk> him with his eye .
“ A person of the name of <unk> <unk> , with a blue <unk> waistcoat with a double row of mother of pearl buttons , ” Mr. Bucket immediately answered .
“ He had as good mind his own business , <unk> he is , ” <unk> the man .
“ He ’ s out of employment , I believe , ” said Mr. Bucket <unk> for <unk> <unk> , “ and so gets talking . ” The woman had not resumed her chair , but stood <unk> with her hand upon its broken back , looking at me .
I thought she would have spoken to me <unk> if she had dared .
She was still in this attitude of <unk> when her husband , who was eating with a <unk> of bread and fat in one hand and his <unk> in the other , struck the handle of his knife violently on the table and told her with an oath to mind HER own business at any rate and sit down .
“ I should like to have seen Jenny very much , ” said I , “ for I am sure she would have told me all she could about this lady , whom I am very anxious indeed — you cannot think how anxious — to <unk> .
Will Jenny be here soon ?
Where is she ? ” The woman had a great desire to answer , but the man , with another oath , openly <unk> at her foot with his heavy <unk> .
He left it to Jenny ’ s husband to say what he <unk> , and after a <unk> silence the latter turned his <unk> head towards me .
“ I ’ m not partial to <unk> coming into my place , as you ’ ve heerd me say afore now , I think , miss .
I let their places be , and it ’ s curious they can ’ t let my place be .
There ’ d be a pretty shine made if I was to go <unk> <unk> , I think .
<unk> , I don ’ t so much complain of you as of some others , and I ’ m agreeable to make you a <unk> answer , though I give notice that I ’ m not a-going to be <unk> like a <unk> .
Will Jenny be here soon ?
No she won ’ t .
Where is she ?
She ’ s gone up to <unk> . ” “ Did she go last night ? ” I asked .
“ Did she go last night ?
Ah !
She went last night , ” he answered with a sulky <unk> of his head .
“ But was she here when the lady came ?
And what did the lady say to her ?
And where is the lady gone ?
I beg and pray you to be so kind as to tell me , ” said I , “ for I am in great distress to know . ” “ If my master would let me speak , and not say a word of harm — ” the woman timidly began .
“ Your master , ” said her husband , muttering an <unk> with slow emphasis , “ will break your neck if you <unk> with wot don ’ t concern you . ” After another silence , the husband of the absent woman , turning to me again , answered me with his usual <unk> <unk> .
“ <unk> Jenny here when the lady come ?
Yes , she wos here when the lady come .
<unk> did the lady say to her ?
Well , I ’ ll tell you wot the lady said to her .
She said , ‘ You remember me as come one time to talk to you about the young lady as had been <unk> of you ?
You remember me as give you <unk> handsome for a <unk> wot she had left ? ’ Ah , she remembered .
So we all did .
Well , then , wos that young lady up at the house now ?
No , she warn ’ t up at the house now .
Well , then , <unk> here .
The lady was upon a journey all alone , strange as we might think it , and could she rest herself where you ’ re a <unk> for a hour or so .
Yes she could , and so she did .
Then she went — it might be at twenty minutes past eleven , and it might be at twenty minutes past twelve ; we ain ’ t got no watches here to know the time by , nor yet clocks .
Where did she go ?
I don ’ t know where she go ’ d .
She went one way , and Jenny went another ; one went right to <unk> , and t ’ other went right from it .
That ’ s all about it .
Ask this man .
He heerd it all , and see it all .
He knows . ” The other man repeated , “ That ’ s all about it . ” “ Was the lady crying ? ” I inquired .
“ <unk> a bit , ” returned the first man .
“ Her shoes was the worse , and her clothes was the worse , but she warn ’ t — not as I see . ” The woman sat with her arms crossed and her eyes upon the ground .
Her husband had turned his seat a little so as to face her and kept his <unk> hand upon the table as if it were in <unk> to execute his <unk> if she <unk> him .
“ I hope you will not object to my asking your wife , ” said I , “ how the lady looked . ” “ Come , then ! ” he <unk> cried to her .
“ You hear what she says .
<unk> it short and tell her . ” “ <unk> , ” replied the woman .
“ <unk> and exhausted .
Very bad . ” “ Did she speak much ? ” “ Not much , but her voice was <unk> . ” She answered , looking all the while at her husband for leave .
“ Was she faint ? ” said I.
“ Did she eat or drink here ? ” “ Go on ! ” said the husband in answer to her look .
“ Tell her and cut it short . ” “ She had a little water , miss , and Jenny fetched her some bread and tea .
But she hardly touched it . ” “ And when she went from here , ” I was proceeding , when Jenny ’ s husband <unk> took me up .
“ When she went from here , she went right away nor ’ ard by the high road .
Ask on the road if you doubt me , and see if it warn ’ t so .
Now , there ’ s the end .
That ’ s all about it . ” I glanced at my companion , and finding that he had already risen and was ready to depart , thanked them for what they had told me , and took my leave .
The woman looked full at Mr. Bucket as he went out , and he looked full at her .
“ Now , Miss Summerson , ” he said to me as we walked quickly away .
“ They ’ ve got her ladyship ’ s watch among ’ em .
That ’ s a positive fact . ” “ You saw it ? ” I exclaimed .
“ Just as good as saw it , ” he returned .
“ <unk> why should he talk about his ‘ twenty minutes past ’ and about his having no watch to tell the time by ?
<unk> minutes !
He don ’ t usually cut his time so fine as that .
If he comes to <unk> , it ’ s as much as HE does .
Now , you see , either her ladyship gave him that watch or he took it .
I think she gave it him .
Now , what should she give it him for ?
What should she give it him for ? ” He repeated this question to himself several times as we hurried on , appearing to balance between a variety of answers that arose in his mind .
“ If time could be spared , ” said Mr. Bucket , “ which is the only thing that can ’ t be spared in this case , I might get it out of that woman ; but it ’ s too doubtful a chance to trust to under present circumstances .
They are up to keeping a close eye upon her , and any fool knows that a poor <unk> like her , beaten and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> from head to foot , will stand by the husband that ill uses her through thick and thin .
There ’ s something kept back .
It ’ s a pity but what we had seen the other woman . ” I regretted it exceedingly , for she was very grateful , and I felt sure would have <unk> no entreaty of mine .
“ It ’ s possible , Miss Summerson , ” said Mr. Bucket , pondering on it , “ that her ladyship sent her up to London with some word for you , and it ’ s possible that her husband got the watch to let her go .
It don ’ t come out altogether so plain as to please me , but it ’ s on the cards .
Now , I don ’ t take kindly to laying out the money of Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , on these <unk> , and I don ’ t see my way to the <unk> of it at present .
No !
So far our road , Miss Summerson , is for ’ ard — straight <unk> — and keeping everything quiet ! ” We called at home once more that I might send a hasty note to my guardian , and then we hurried back to where we had left the carriage .
The horses were brought out as soon as we were seen coming , and we were on the road again in a few minutes .
It had set in <unk> at <unk> , and it now <unk> hard .
The air was so thick with the darkness of the day and the <unk> of the fall that we could see but a very little way in any direction .
Although it was extremely cold , the snow was but <unk> frozen , and it <unk> — with a sound as if it were a <unk> of small <unk> — under the <unk> of the horses into mire and water .
They sometimes slipped and <unk> for a mile together , and we were obliged to come to a <unk> to rest them .
One horse fell three times in this first stage , and trembled so and was so shaken that the driver had to <unk> from his <unk> and lead him at last .
I could eat nothing and could not sleep , and I grew so nervous under those <unk> and the slow pace at which we <unk> that I had an unreasonable desire upon me to get out and walk .
<unk> to my companion ’ s better sense , however , I remained where I was .
All this time , kept fresh by a certain enjoyment of the work in which he was engaged , he was up and down at every house we came to , addressing people whom he had never beheld before as old <unk> , running in to warm himself at every fire he saw , talking and drinking and shaking hands at every bar and tap , friendly with every waggoner , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , yet never seeming to lose time , and always <unk> to the box again with his watchful , steady face and his business-like “ Get on , my lad ! ” When we were changing horses the next time , he came from the <unk> , with the wet snow <unk> upon him and <unk> off him — <unk> and <unk> through it to his wet knees as he had been doing frequently since we left Saint Albans — and spoke to me at the carriage side .
“ <unk> up your spirits .
It ’ s certainly true that she came on here , Miss Summerson .
There ’ s not a doubt of the dress by this time , and the dress has been seen here . ” “ Still on foot ? ” said I.
“ Still on foot .
I think the gentleman you mentioned must be the point she ’ s <unk> at , and yet I don ’ t like his living down in her own part of the country neither . ” “ I know so little , ” said I.
“ There may be some one else nearer here , of whom I never heard . ” “ That ’ s true .
But whatever you do , don ’ t you fall <unk> , my dear ; and don ’ t you <unk> yourself no more than you can help .
Get on , my lad ! ” The sleet fell all that day <unk> , a thick mist came on early , and it never rose or <unk> for a moment .
Such roads I had never seen .
I sometimes feared we had missed the way and got into the <unk> grounds or the marshes .
If I ever thought of the time I had been out , it presented itself as an <unk> period of great <unk> , and I seemed , in a strange way , never to have been free from the anxiety under which I then laboured .
As we advanced , I began to feel <unk> that my companion lost confidence .
He was the same as before with all the <unk> people , but he looked <unk> when he sat by himself on the box .
I saw his finger <unk> going across and across his mouth during the whole of one long weary stage .
I overheard that he began to ask the <unk> of <unk> and other vehicles coming towards us what passengers they had seen in other <unk> and vehicles that were in advance .
Their replies did not encourage him .
He always gave me a <unk> <unk> of his finger and lift of his <unk> as he got upon the box again , but he seemed perplexed now when he said , “ Get on , my lad ! ” At last , when we were changing , he told me that he had lost the track of the dress so long that he began to be surprised .
It was nothing , he said , to lose such a track for one while , and to take it up for another while , and so on ; but it had disappeared here in an unaccountable manner , and we had not come upon it since .
This <unk> the <unk> I had formed , when he began to look at <unk> , and to leave the carriage at cross roads for a quarter of an hour at a time while he <unk> them .
But I was not to be <unk> , he told me , for it was as likely as not that the next stage might set us right again .
The next stage , however , ended as that one ended ; we had no new clue .
There was a <unk> inn here , solitary , but a comfortable <unk> building , and as we drove in under a large gateway before I knew it , where a <unk> and her pretty daughters came to the <unk> , <unk> me to <unk> and <unk> myself while the horses were making ready , I thought it would be <unk> to refuse .
They took me upstairs to a warm room and left me there .
It was at the corner of the house , I remember , looking two ways .
On one side to a <unk> open to a <unk> , where the <unk> were <unk> the <unk> and tired horses from the muddy carriage , and beyond that to the <unk> itself , across which the sign was heavily swinging ; on the other side to a wood of dark <unk> .
Their branches were <unk> with snow , and it silently dropped off in wet heaps while I stood at the window .
Night was setting in , and its <unk> was <unk> by the contrast of the <unk> fire glowing and <unk> in the <unk> .
As I looked among the <unk> of the trees and followed the discoloured marks in the snow where the <unk> was sinking into it and <unk> it , I thought of the motherly face brightly set off by daughters that had just now <unk> me and of MY mother lying down in such a wood to die .
I was frightened when I found them all about me , but I remembered that before I <unk> I tried very hard not to do it ; and that was some little comfort .
They <unk> me up on a large sofa by the fire , and then the <unk> <unk> told me that I must travel no further to-night , but must go to bed .
But this put me into such a tremble lest they should <unk> me there that she soon recalled her words and <unk> for a rest of half an hour .
A good endearing creature she was .
She and her three fair girls , all so busy about me .
I was to take hot <unk> and <unk> <unk> , while Mr. Bucket dried himself and <unk> elsewhere ; but I could not do it when a <unk> round table was presently spread by the fireside , though I was very unwilling to <unk> them .
However , I could take some toast and some hot <unk> ; and as I really enjoyed that refreshment , it made some <unk> .
<unk> to the time , at the half-hour ’ s end the carriage came <unk> under the gateway , and they took me down , warmed , refreshed , <unk> by kindness , and safe ( I assured them ) not to faint any more .
After I had got in and had taken a grateful leave of them all , the youngest daughter — a blooming girl of <unk> , who was to be the first married , they had told me — got upon the carriage step , reached in , and kissed me .
I have never seen her , from that hour , but I think of her to this hour as my friend .
The <unk> windows with the fire and light , looking so bright and warm from the cold darkness out of doors , were soon gone , and again we were crushing and <unk> the loose snow .
We went on with <unk> enough , but the dismal roads were not much worse than they had been , and the stage was only nine miles .
My companion smoking on the box — I had thought at the last inn of begging him to do so when I saw him standing at a great fire in a comfortable cloud of tobacco — was as <unk> as ever and as quickly down and up again when we came to any human <unk> or any human creature .
He had lighted his little dark lantern , which seemed to be a favourite with him , for we had lamps to the carriage ; and every now and then he turned it upon me to see that I was doing well .
There was a <unk> to the <unk> , but I never closed it , for it seemed like shutting out hope .
We came to the end of the stage , and still the lost trace was not recovered .
I looked at him anxiously when we stopped to change , but I knew by his yet <unk> face as he stood watching the <unk> that he had heard nothing .
<unk> in an instant afterwards , as I leaned back in my seat , he looked in , with his lighted lantern in his hand , an excited and quite different man .
“ What is it ? ” said I , starting .
“ Is she here ? ” “ No , no .
Don ’ t deceive yourself , my dear .
Nobody ’ s here .
But I ’ ve got it ! ” The <unk> snow was in his <unk> , in his hair , lying in <unk> on his dress .
He had to shake it from his face and get his breath before he spoke to me .
“ Now , Miss Summerson , ” said he , beating his finger on the apron , “ don ’ t you be disappointed at what I ’ m a-going to do .
You know me .
I ’ m Inspector Bucket , and you can trust me .
We ’ ve come a long way ; never mind .
<unk> horses out there for the next stage up !
<unk> ! ” There was a <unk> in the yard , and a man came running out of the stables to know if he meant up or down .
“ Up , I tell you !
Up !
Ain ’ t it English ?
Up ! ” “ Up ? ” said I , astonished .
“ To London !
Are we going back ? ” “ Miss Summerson , ” he answered , “ back .
<unk> back as a die .
You know me .
Don ’ t be afraid .
I ’ ll follow the other , by <unk> — — ” “ The other ? ” I repeated .
“ Who ? ” “ You called her Jenny , didn ’ t you ?
I ’ ll follow her .
Bring those two pair out here for a crown a man .
<unk> up , some of you ! ” “ You will not desert this lady we are in search of ; you will not abandon her on such a night and in such a state of mind as I know her to be in ! ” said I , in an agony , and <unk> his hand .
“ You are right , my dear , I won ’ t .
But I ’ ll follow the other .
Look alive here with them horses .
<unk> a man for ’ ard in the <unk> to the next stage , and let him send another for ’ ard again , and order four on , up , right through .
My darling , don ’ t you be afraid ! ” These orders and the way in which he ran about the yard <unk> them caused a general excitement that was scarcely less <unk> to me than the sudden change .
But in the height of the confusion , a <unk> man <unk> away to order the <unk> , and our horses were put to with great speed .
“ My dear , ” said Mr. Bucket , <unk> to his seat and looking in again , “ — you ’ ll excuse me if I ’ m too familiar — don ’ t you <unk> and <unk> yourself no more than you can help .
I say nothing else at present ; but you know me , my dear ; now , don ’ t you ? ” I <unk> to say that I knew he was far more capable than I of <unk> what we ought to do , but was he sure that this was right ?
Could I not go forward by myself in search of — I <unk> his hand again in my distress and whispered it to him — of my own mother .
“ My dear , ” he answered , “ I know , I know , and would I put you wrong , do you think ?
Inspector Bucket .
Now you know me , don ’ t you ? ” What could I say but yes !
“ Then you keep up as good a heart as you can , and you rely upon me for standing by you , no less than by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet .
Now , are you right there ? ” “ All right , sir ! ” “ <unk> she goes , then .
And get on , my <unk> ! ” We were again upon the melancholy road by which we had come , tearing up the <unk> sleet and <unk> snow as if they were torn up by a <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> A <unk> Day and Night Still <unk> , as <unk> its <unk> , the Dedlock town house carries itself as usual towards the street of dismal grandeur .
There are <unk> heads from time to time in the little windows of the hall , looking out at the <unk> powder falling all day from the sky ; and in the same <unk> there is <unk> <unk> turning itself <unk> to the great hall fire from the <unk> weather out of doors .
It is given out that my Lady has gone down into Lincolnshire , but is expected to return presently .
<unk> , busy <unk> , however , will not go down into Lincolnshire .
It <unk> in <unk> and chattering about town .
It knows that that poor unfortunate man , Sir Leicester , has been <unk> used .
It hears , my dear child , all sorts of shocking things .
It makes the world of five miles round quite merry .
Not to know that there is something wrong at the Dedlocks ’ is to <unk> yourself unknown .
One of the <unk> <unk> with the skeleton throats is already <unk> of all the principal circumstances that will come out before the <unk> on Sir Leicester ’ s application for a bill of <unk> .
At <unk> and <unk> ’ s the <unk> and at Sheen and Gloss ’ s the <unk> , it is and will be for several hours the <unk> of the age , the feature of the century .
The <unk> of those <unk> , <unk> so <unk> <unk> , being as <unk> <unk> and <unk> there as any other article of the <unk> , are perfectly understood in this new fashion by the <unk> hand behind the counter .
“ Our people , Mr. <unk> , ” said <unk> and <unk> to the hand in question on engaging him , “ our people , sir , are sheep — mere sheep .
Where two or three marked ones go , all the rest follow .
<unk> those two or three in your eye , Mr. <unk> , and you have the <unk> . ” So , likewise , Sheen and Gloss to THEIR <unk> , in reference to knowing where to have the fashionable people and how to bring what they ( Sheen and Gloss ) choose into fashion .
On similar <unk> principles , Mr. Sladdery the <unk> , and indeed the great <unk> of <unk> sheep , admits this very day , “ Why yes , sir , there certainly ARE reports concerning Lady Dedlock , very <unk> indeed among my high connexion , sir .
You see , my high connexion must talk about something , sir ; and it ’ s only to get a subject into <unk> with one or two ladies I could name to make it go down with the whole .
Just what I should have done with those ladies , sir , in the case of any novelty you had left to me to bring in , they have done of themselves in this case through knowing Lady Dedlock and being perhaps a little innocently jealous of her too , sir .
You ’ ll find , sir , that this <unk> will be very popular among my high connexion .
If it had been a speculation , sir , it would have brought money .
And when I say so , you may trust to my being right , sir , for I have made it my business to study my high connexion and to be able to wind it up like a clock , sir . ” Thus <unk> <unk> in the capital , and will not go down into Lincolnshire .
By half-past five , post <unk> , <unk> <unk> ’ time , it has even <unk> a new remark from the Honourable Mr. Stables , which <unk> fair to <unk> the old one , on which he has so long rested his <unk> reputation .
This sparkling <unk> is to the effect that although he always knew she was the <unk> woman in the <unk> , he had no idea she was a <unk> .
It is <unk> received in <unk> .
At <unk> and <unk> also , in <unk> she has often <unk> , and among <unk> she <unk> but yesterday , she is still the <unk> subject .
What is it ?
Who is it ?
When was it ?
Where was it ?
How was it ?
She is discussed by her dear friends with all the <unk> <unk> in <unk> , with the last new word , the last new manner , the last new <unk> , and the perfection of polite indifference .
A remarkable feature of the theme is that it is found to be so <unk> that several people come out upon it who never came out before — positively say things !
William Buffy carries one of these <unk> from the place where he <unk> down to the House , where the <unk> for his party hands it about with his <unk> to keep men together who want to be off , with such effect that the <unk> ( who has had it <unk> <unk> into his own ear under the corner of his wig ) cries , “ <unk> at the bar ! ” three times without making an impression .
And not the least <unk> circumstance connected with her being <unk> the town talk is that people hovering on the <unk> of Mr. Sladdery ’ s high connexion , people who know nothing and ever did know nothing about her , think it essential to their reputation to pretend that she is their <unk> too , and to <unk> her at second-hand with the last new word and the last new manner , and the last new <unk> , and the last new polite indifference , and all the rest of it , all at second-hand but considered equal to new in <unk> <unk> and to <unk> stars .
If there be any man of letters , art , or science among these little <unk> , how noble in him to support the feeble sisters on such majestic <unk> !
So goes the wintry day outside the Dedlock mansion .
How within it ?
Sir Leicester , lying in his bed , can speak a little , though with difficulty and <unk> .
He is <unk> to silence and to rest , and they have given him some <unk> to <unk> his pain , for his old enemy is very hard with him .
He is never asleep , though sometimes he seems to fall into a dull waking <unk> .
He caused his bedstead to be moved out nearer to the window when he heard it was such <unk> weather , and his head to be so <unk> that he could see the <unk> snow and sleet .
He watches it as it falls , throughout the whole wintry day .
Upon the least noise in the house , which is kept hushed , his hand is at the pencil .
The old housekeeper , sitting by him , knows what he would write and whispers , “ No , he has not come back yet , Sir Leicester .
It was late last night when he went .
He has been but a little time gone yet . ” He withdraws his hand and falls to looking at the sleet and snow again until they seem , by being long looked at , to fall so thick and fast that he is obliged to close his eyes for a minute on the giddy <unk> of white <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
He began to look at them as soon as it was light .
The day is not yet far spent when he <unk> it to be necessary that her rooms should be prepared for her .
It is very cold and wet .
Let there be good fires .
Let them know that she is expected .
Please see to it yourself .
He writes to this purpose on his slate , and Mrs. Rouncewell with a heavy heart <unk> .
“ For I dread , George , ” the old lady says to her son , who <unk> below to keep her company when she has a little leisure , “ I dread , my dear , that my Lady will never more set foot within these walls . ” “ That ’ s a bad <unk> , mother . ” “ Nor yet within the walls of Chesney Wold , my dear . ” “ That ’ s worse .
But why , mother ? ” “ When I saw my Lady yesterday , George , she looked to me — and I may say at me too — as if the step on the Ghost ’ s Walk had almost walked her down . ” “ Come , come !
You alarm yourself with <unk> fears , mother . ” “ No I don ’ t , my dear .
No I don ’ t .
It ’ s going on for <unk> year that I have been in this family , and I never had any fears for it before .
But it ’ s breaking up , my dear ; the great old Dedlock family is breaking up . ” “ I hope not , mother . ” “ I am thankful I have lived long enough to be with Sir Leicester in this illness and trouble , for I know I am not too old nor too useless to be a <unk> sight to him than anybody else in my place would be .
But the step on the Ghost ’ s Walk will walk my Lady down , George ; it has been many a day behind her , and now it will pass her and go on . ” “ Well , mother dear , I say again , I hope not . ” “ Ah , so do I , George , ” the old lady returns , shaking her head and parting her folded hands .
“ But if my fears come true , and he has to know it , who will tell him ! ” “ Are these her rooms ? ” “ These are my Lady ’ s rooms , just as she left them . ” “ Why , now , ” says the trooper , glancing round him and speaking in a lower voice , “ I begin to understand how you come to think as you do think , mother .
<unk> get an awful look about them when they are <unk> up , like these , for one person you are used to see in them , and that person is away under any shadow , let alone being God knows where . ” He is not far out .
As all <unk> <unk> the great final one , so , empty rooms , <unk> of a familiar presence , <unk> whisper what your room and what mine must one day be .
My Lady ’ s state has a hollow look , thus gloomy and abandoned ; and in the inner apartment , where Mr. Bucket last night made his secret <unk> , the traces of her dresses and her ornaments , even the mirrors accustomed to reflect them when they were a portion of herself , have a desolate and vacant air .
<unk> and cold as the wintry day is , it is <unk> and <unk> in these deserted chambers than in many a <unk> that will <unk> <unk> the weather ; and though the servants heap fires in the <unk> and set the <unk> and the chairs within the warm glass screens that let their <unk> light <unk> through to the <unk> corners , there is a heavy cloud upon the rooms which no light will <unk> .
The old housekeeper and her son remain until the preparations are complete , and then she returns upstairs .
Volumnia has taken Mrs. Rouncewell ’ s place in the meantime , though pearl <unk> and rouge pots , however calculated to <unk> Bath , are but indifferent comforts to the <unk> under present circumstances .
Volumnia , not being supposed to know ( and indeed not knowing ) what is the matter , has found it a <unk> task to offer <unk> observations and consequently has <unk> their place with <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> on <unk> , <unk> peeping at her kinsman ’ s eyes , and one <unk> whisper to herself of , “ He is asleep . ” In <unk> of which superfluous remark Sir Leicester has indignantly written on the slate , “ I am not . ” <unk> , therefore , the chair at the bedside to the <unk> old housekeeper , Volumnia sits at a table a little removed , <unk> <unk> .
Sir Leicester watches the sleet and snow and listens for the returning steps that he <unk> .
In the ears of his old servant , looking as if she had <unk> out of an old <unk> to attend a <unk> Dedlock to another world , the silence is <unk> with <unk> of her own words , “ Who will tell him ! ” He has been under his <unk> ’ s hands this morning to be made <unk> and is as well got up as the circumstances will allow .
He is <unk> with pillows , his grey hair is brushed in its usual manner , his linen is arranged to a <unk> , and he is wrapped in a responsible <unk> .
His eye-glass and his watch are ready to his hand .
It is necessary — less to his own dignity now perhaps than for her sake — that he should be seen as little disturbed and as much himself as may be .
<unk> will talk , and Volumnia , though a Dedlock , is no <unk> case .
He keeps her here , there is little doubt , to prevent her talking somewhere else .
He is very ill , but he makes his present stand against distress of mind and body most <unk> .
The fair Volumnia , being one of those sprightly girls who cannot long continue silent without <unk> <unk> of <unk> by the dragon <unk> , soon <unk> the approach of that monster with a series of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> it impossible to <unk> those <unk> by any other process than conversation , she compliments Mrs. Rouncewell on her son , <unk> that he positively is one of the <unk> figures she ever saw and as soldierly a looking person , she should think , as what ’ s his name , her favourite <unk> <unk> — the man she <unk> on , the dearest of creatures — who was killed at <unk> .
Sir Leicester hears this tribute with so much surprise and stares about him in such a confused way that Mrs. Rouncewell feels it necessary to explain .
“ Miss Dedlock don ’ t speak of my eldest son , Sir Leicester , but my youngest .
I have found him .
He has come home . ” Sir Leicester breaks silence with a <unk> cry .
“ George ?
Your son George come home , Mrs. Rouncewell ? ” The old housekeeper <unk> her eyes .
“ Thank God .
Yes , Sir Leicester . ” Does this discovery of some one lost , this return of some one so long gone , come upon him as a strong confirmation of his hopes ?
Does he think , “ Shall I not , with the aid I have , recall her safely after this , there being <unk> hours in her case than there are years in his ? ” It is of no use <unk> him ; he is determined to speak now , and he does .
In a thick crowd of sounds , but still <unk> enough to be understood .
“ Why did you not tell me , Mrs. Rouncewell ? ” “ It happened only yesterday , Sir Leicester , and I doubted your being well enough to be talked to of such things . ” Besides , the giddy Volumnia now remembers with her little scream that nobody was to have known of his being Mrs. Rouncewell ’ s son and that she was not to have told .
But Mrs. Rouncewell <unk> , with warmth enough to swell the stomacher , that of course she would have told Sir Leicester as soon as he got better .
“ Where is your son George , Mrs. Rouncewell ? ” asks Sir Leicester , Mrs. Rouncewell , not a little alarmed by his <unk> of the doctor ’ s injunctions , replies , in London .
“ Where in London ? ” Mrs. Rouncewell is constrained to admit that he is in the house .
“ Bring him here to my room .
Bring him directly . ” The old lady can do nothing but go in search of him .
Sir Leicester , with such power of movement as he has , <unk> himself a little to receive him .
When he has done so , he looks out again at the falling sleet and snow and listens again for the returning steps .
A quantity of straw has been tumbled down in the street to <unk> the <unk> there , and she might be driven to the door perhaps without his hearing wheels .
He is lying thus , apparently <unk> of his <unk> and minor surprise , when the housekeeper returns , accompanied by her trooper son .
Mr. George <unk> softly to the bedside , makes his bow , <unk> his chest , and stands , with his face flushed , very heartily ashamed of himself .
“ Good heaven , and it is really George Rouncewell ! ” exclaims Sir Leicester .
“ Do you remember me , George ? ” The trooper <unk> to look at him and to separate this sound from that sound before he knows what he has said , but doing this and being a little helped by his mother , he replies , “ I must have a very bad memory , indeed , Sir Leicester , if I failed to remember you . ” “ When I look at you , George Rouncewell , ” Sir Leicester observes with difficulty , “ I see something of a boy at Chesney Wold — I remember well — very well . ” He looks at the trooper until tears come into his eyes , and then he looks at the sleet and snow again .
“ I ask your pardon , Sir Leicester , ” says the trooper , “ but would you accept of my arms to raise you up ?
You would lie easier , Sir Leicester , if you would allow me to move you . ” “ If you please , George Rouncewell ; if you will be so good . ” The trooper takes him in his arms like a child , lightly <unk> him , and turns him with his face more towards the window .
“ Thank you .
You have your mother ’ s gentleness , ” returns Sir Leicester , “ and your own strength .
Thank you . ” He signs to him with his hand not to go away .
George quietly remains at the bedside , waiting to be spoken to .
“ Why did you wish for secrecy ? ” It takes Sir Leicester some time to ask this .
“ Truly I am not much to boast of , Sir Leicester , and I — I should still , Sir Leicester , if you was not so <unk> — which I hope you will not be long — I should still hope for the favour of being allowed to remain unknown in general .
That <unk> <unk> not very hard to be <unk> at , not very well <unk> here , and not very <unk> to myself .
However opinions may <unk> on a variety of subjects , I should think it would be universally agreed , Sir Leicester , that I am not much to boast of . ” “ You have been a soldier , ” observes Sir Leicester , “ and a faithful one . ” George makes his military bow .
“ As far as that goes , Sir Leicester , I have done my duty under discipline , and it was the least I could do . ” “ You find me , ” says Sir Leicester , whose eyes are much attracted towards him , “ far from well , George Rouncewell . ” “ I am very sorry both to hear it and to see it , Sir Leicester . ” “ I am sure you are .
No .
In addition to my older <unk> , I have had a sudden and bad <unk> .
Something that <unk> , ” making an endeavour to pass one hand down one side , “ and <unk> , ” touching his lips .
George , with a look of assent and sympathy , makes another bow .
The different times when they were both young men ( the trooper much the younger of the two ) and looked at one another down at Chesney Wold arise before them both and soften both .
Sir Leicester , evidently with a great determination to say , in his own manner , something that is on his mind before relapsing into silence , tries to raise himself among his pillows a little more .
George , observant of the action , takes him in his arms again and places him as he <unk> to be .
“ Thank you , George .
You are another self to me .
You have often carried my spare gun at Chesney Wold , George .
You are familiar to me in these strange circumstances , very familiar . ” He has put Sir Leicester ’ s <unk> arm over his shoulder in lifting him up , and Sir Leicester is slow in drawing it away again as he says these words .
“ I was about to add , ” he presently goes on , “ I was about to add , respecting this <unk> , that it was <unk> <unk> with a slight <unk> between my Lady and myself .
I do not mean that there was any difference between us ( for there has been none ) , but that there was a <unk> of certain circumstances important only to ourselves , which <unk> me , for a little while , of my Lady ’ s society .
She has found it necessary to make a journey — I trust will shortly return .
Volumnia , do I make myself <unk> ?
The words are not quite under my command in the manner of <unk> them . ” Volumnia <unk> him perfectly , and in truth he delivers himself with far greater <unk> than could have been supposed possible a minute ago .
The effort by which he does so is written in the anxious and labouring expression of his face .
Nothing but the strength of his purpose <unk> him to make it .
“ Therefore , Volumnia , I desire to say in your presence — and in the presence of my old <unk> and friend , Mrs. Rouncewell , whose truth and fidelity no one can question , and in the presence of her son George , who comes back like a familiar recollection of my youth in the home of my <unk> at Chesney Wold — in case I should <unk> , in case I should not recover , in case I should lose both my speech and the power of writing , though I hope for better things — ” The old housekeeper weeping silently ; Volumnia in the greatest agitation , with the <unk> bloom on her cheeks ; the trooper with his arms folded and his head a little bent , respectfully attentive .
“ Therefore I desire to say , and to call you all to witness — beginning , Volumnia , with yourself , most solemnly — that I am on <unk> terms with Lady Dedlock .
That I <unk> no cause whatever of complaint against her .
That I have ever had the strongest affection for her , and that I retain it <unk> .
Say this to herself , and to every one .
If you ever say less than this , you will be guilty of <unk> <unk> to me . ” Volumnia <unk> <unk> that she will observe his injunctions to the letter .
“ My Lady is too high in position , too handsome , too accomplished , too superior in most respects to the best of those by whom she is surrounded , not to have her enemies and <unk> , I dare say .
Let it be known to them , as I make it known to you , that being of sound mind , memory , and understanding , I <unk> no disposition I have made in her favour .
I <unk> nothing I have ever bestowed upon her .
I am on <unk> terms with her , and I recall — having the full power to do it if I were so disposed , as you see — no act I have done for her advantage and happiness . ” His formal array of words might have at any other time , as it has often had , something <unk> in it , but at this time it is serious and affecting .
His noble earnestness , his fidelity , his <unk> <unk> of her , his generous <unk> of his own wrong and his own pride for her sake , are simply honourable , <unk> , and true .
Nothing less worthy can be seen through the <unk> of such qualities in the <unk> <unk> , nothing less worthy can be seen in the <unk> gentleman .
In such a light both <unk> alike , both rise alike , both children of the dust shine equally .
<unk> by his <unk> , he lays his head back on his pillows and closes his eyes for not more than a minute , when he again resumes his watching of the weather and his attention to the muffled sounds .
In the rendering of those little services , and in the manner of their acceptance , the trooper has become <unk> as necessary to him .
Nothing has been said , but it is quite understood .
He falls a step or two backward to be out of sight and <unk> guard a little behind his mother ’ s chair .
The day is now beginning to decline .
The mist and the sleet into which the snow has all resolved itself are <unk> , and the blaze begins to tell more <unk> upon the room walls and furniture .
The gloom <unk> ; the bright gas <unk> up in the streets ; and the <unk> oil lamps which yet hold their ground there , with their source of life half frozen and half <unk> , <unk> <unk> like fiery fish out of water — as they are .
The world , which has been <unk> over the straw and pulling at the bell , “ to inquire , ” begins to go home , begins to dress , to dine , to <unk> its dear friend with all the last new <unk> , as already mentioned .
Now does Sir Leicester become worse , restless , uneasy , and in great pain .
Volumnia , lighting a candle ( with a <unk> <unk> for doing something <unk> ) , is bidden to put it out again , for it is not yet dark enough .
Yet it is very dark too , as dark as it will be all night .
By and by she tries again .
No !
Put it out .
It is not dark enough yet .
His old housekeeper is the first to understand that he is striving to <unk> the fiction with himself that it is not growing late .
“ Dear Sir Leicester , my honoured master , ” she softly whispers , “ I must , for your own good , and my duty , take the <unk> of begging and <unk> that you will not lie here in the <unk> darkness watching and waiting and dragging through the time .
Let me draw the curtains , and light the candles , and make things more comfortable about you .
The <unk> will strike the hours just the same , Sir Leicester , and the night will pass away just the same .
My Lady will come back , just the same . ” “ I know it , Mrs. Rouncewell , but I am weak — and she has been so long gone . ” “ Not so very long , Sir Leicester .
Not <unk> hours yet . ” “ But that is a long time .
Oh , it is a long time ! ” He says it with a groan that <unk> her heart .
She knows that this is not a period for bringing the rough light upon him ; she thinks his tears too sacred to be seen , even by her .
Therefore she sits in the darkness for a while without a word , then gently begins to move about , now stirring the fire , now standing at the dark window looking out .
<unk> he tells her , with recovered <unk> , “ As you say , Mrs. Rouncewell , it is no worse for being confessed .
It is getting late , and they are not come .
<unk> the room ! ” When it is lighted and the weather shut out , it is only left to him to listen .
But they find that however dejected and ill he is , he <unk> when a quiet pretence is made of looking at the fires in her rooms and being sure that everything is ready to receive her .
Poor pretence as it is , these <unk> to her being expected keep up hope within him .
<unk> comes , and with it the same blank .
The carriages in the streets are few , and other late sounds in that neighbourhood there are none , unless a man so very <unk> drunk as to stray into the <unk> <unk> goes <unk> and <unk> along the pavement .
Upon this wintry night it is so still that listening to the intense silence is like looking at intense darkness .
If any distant sound be audible in this case , it departs through the gloom like a feeble light in that , and all is <unk> than before .
The <unk> of servants are dismissed to bed ( not unwilling to go , for they were up all last night ) , and only Mrs. Rouncewell and George keep watch in Sir Leicester ’ s room .
As the night <unk> <unk> on — or rather when it seems to stop altogether , at between two and three o ’ clock — they find a restless <unk> on him to know more about the weather , now he cannot see it .
Hence George , <unk> regularly every half-hour to the rooms so carefully looked after , <unk> his march to the <unk> , looks about him , and brings back the best report he can make of the worst of nights , the sleet still falling and even the stone <unk> lying <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Volumnia , in her room up a retired landing on the staircase — the second turning past the end of the <unk> and <unk> , a cousinly room containing a fearful <unk> of a portrait of Sir Leicester <unk> for its <unk> , and commanding in the day a solemn yard planted with <unk> <unk> like <unk> specimens of black tea — is a prey to horrors of many kinds .
Not last nor least among them , possibly , is a horror of what may <unk> her little income in the event , as she expresses it , “ of anything <unk> ” to Sir Leicester .
Anything , in this sense , meaning one thing only ; and that the last thing that can happen to the consciousness of any baronet in the known world .
An effect of these horrors is that Volumnia finds she cannot go to bed in her own room or sit by the fire in her own room , but must come forth with her fair head tied up in a <unk> of shawl , and her fair form <unk> in <unk> , and <unk> the mansion like a ghost , particularly <unk> the rooms , warm and <unk> , prepared for one who still does not return .
<unk> under such circumstances being not to be thought of , Volumnia is attended by her maid , who , impressed from her own bed for that purpose , extremely cold , very <unk> , and generally an injured maid as <unk> by circumstances to take office with a cousin , when she had resolved to be maid to nothing less than ten thousand a year , has not a sweet expression of countenance .
The <unk> visits of the trooper to these rooms , however , in the course of his <unk> is an assurance of protection and company both to mistress and maid , which <unk> them very <unk> in the small hours of the night .
Whenever he is heard advancing , they both make some little <unk> preparation to receive him ; at other times they <unk> their watches into short scraps of oblivion and <unk> not wholly free from <unk> , as to whether Miss Dedlock , sitting with her feet upon the <unk> , was or was not falling into the fire when <unk> ( to her great displeasure ) by her guardian <unk> the maid .
“ How is Sir Leicester now , Mr. George ? ” inquires Volumnia , adjusting her <unk> over her head .
“ Why , Sir Leicester is much the same , miss .
He is very low and ill , and he even <unk> a little sometimes . ” “ Has he asked for me ? ” inquires Volumnia tenderly .
“ Why , no , I can ’ t say he has , miss .
Not within my hearing , that is to say . ” “ This is a truly sad time , Mr. George . ” “ It is indeed , miss .
Hadn ’ t you better go to bed ? ” “ You had a deal better go to bed , Miss Dedlock , ” quoth the maid sharply .
But Volumnia answers No !
No !
She may be asked for , she may be wanted at a moment ’ s notice .
She never should forgive herself “ if anything was to happen ” and she was not on the spot .
She <unk> to enter on the question , <unk> by the maid , how the spot comes to be there , and not in her room ( which is nearer to Sir Leicester ’ s ) , but <unk> declares that on the spot she will remain .
Volumnia further makes a merit of not having “ closed an eye ” — as if she had twenty or thirty — though it is hard to <unk> this <unk> with her having most <unk> opened two within five minutes .
But when it comes to four o ’ clock , and still the same blank , Volumnia ’ s constancy begins to fail her , or rather it begins to <unk> , for she now considers that it is her duty to be ready for the morrow , when much may be expected of her , that , in fact , <unk> anxious to remain upon the spot , it may be required of her , as an act of <unk> , to desert the spot .
So when the trooper <unk> with his , “ Hadn ’ t you better go to bed , miss ? ” and when the maid <unk> , more sharply than before , “ You had a deal better go to bed , Miss Dedlock ! ” she <unk> rises and says , “ Do with me what you think best ! ” Mr. George undoubtedly thinks it best to escort her on his arm to the door of her cousinly chamber , and the maid as undoubtedly thinks it best to <unk> her into bed with mighty little ceremony .
<unk> , these steps are taken ; and now the trooper , in his <unk> , has the house to himself .
There is no <unk> in the weather .
From the <unk> , from the <unk> , from the parapet , from every <unk> and post and pillar , <unk> the <unk> snow .
It has crept , as if for shelter , into the <unk> of the great door — under it , into the corners of the windows , into every <unk> and <unk> of retreat , and there <unk> and dies .
It is falling still ; upon the roof , upon the skylight , even through the skylight , and drip , drip , drip , with the <unk> of the Ghost ’ s Walk , on the stone floor below .
The trooper , his old <unk> awakened by the solitary grandeur of a great house — no novelty to him once at Chesney Wold — goes up the stairs and through the chief rooms , holding up his light at arm ’ s length .
<unk> of his <unk> fortunes within the last few weeks , and of his rustic <unk> , and of the two periods of his life so strangely brought together across the wide <unk> space ; thinking of the murdered man whose image is fresh in his mind ; thinking of the lady who has disappeared from these very rooms and the tokens of whose <unk> presence are all here ; thinking of the master of the house upstairs and of the <unk> , “ Who will tell him ! ” he looks here and looks there , and <unk> how he <unk> see something now , which it would tax his <unk> to walk up to , lay his hand upon , and prove to be a fancy .
But it is all blank , blank as the darkness above and below , while he goes up the great staircase again , blank as the <unk> silence .
“ All is still in <unk> , George Rouncewell ? ” “ Quite orderly and right , Sir Leicester . ” “ No word of any kind ? ” The trooper shakes his head .
“ No letter that can possibly have been <unk> ? ” But he knows there is no such hope as that and lays his head down without looking for an answer .
Very familiar to him , as he said himself some hours ago , George Rouncewell lifts him into easier <unk> through the long remainder of the blank wintry night , and equally familiar with his <unk> wish , <unk> the light and <unk> the curtains at the first late break of day .
The day comes like a <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , and vague , it sends a warning <unk> before it of a <unk> <unk> , as if it cried out , “ Look what I am bringing you who watch there !
Who will tell him ! ” CHAPTER <unk> Esther ’ s Narrative It was three o ’ clock in the morning when the houses outside London did at last begin to <unk> the country and to close us in with streets .
We had made our way along roads in a far worse condition than when we had <unk> them by daylight , both the fall and the <unk> having lasted ever since ; but the energy of my companion never <unk> .
It had only been , as I thought , of less assistance than the horses in getting us on , and it had often <unk> them .
They had stopped exhausted <unk> up hills , they had been driven through streams of <unk> water , they had slipped down and become <unk> with the <unk> ; but he and his little lantern had been always ready , and when the <unk> was set right , I had never heard any <unk> in his cool , “ Get on , my <unk> ! ” The <unk> and confidence with which he had directed our journey back I could not account for .
Never <unk> , he never even stopped to make an inquiry until we were within a few miles of London .
A very few words , here and there , were then enough for him ; and thus we came , at between three and four o ’ clock in the morning , into <unk> .
I will not <unk> on the suspense and anxiety with which I reflected all this time that we were leaving my mother farther and farther behind every minute .
I think I had some strong hope that he must be right and could not fail to have a satisfactory object in following this woman , but I <unk> myself with <unk> it and <unk> it during the whole journey .
What was to <unk> when we found her and what could <unk> us for this loss of time were questions also that I could not possibly dismiss ; my mind was quite <unk> by long dwelling on such <unk> when we stopped .
We stopped in a <unk> where there was a <unk> .
My companion paid our two <unk> , who were as completely covered with <unk> as if they had been dragged along the roads like the carriage itself , and giving them some brief direction where to take it , lifted me out of it and into a <unk> he had chosen from the rest .
“ Why , my dear ! ” he said as he did this .
“ How wet you are ! ” I had not been conscious of it .
But the melted snow had found its way into the carriage , and I had got out two or three times when a fallen horse was plunging and had to be got up , and the wet had <unk> my dress .
I assured him it was no matter , but the driver , who knew him , would not be <unk> by me from running down the street to his stable , whence he brought an <unk> of clean dry straw .
They shook it out and <unk> it well about me , and I found it warm and comfortable .
“ Now , my dear , ” said Mr. Bucket , with his head in at the window after I was shut up .
“ We ’ re a-going to mark this person down .
It may take a little time , but you don ’ t mind that .
You ’ re pretty sure that I ’ ve got a <unk> .
Ain ’ t you ? ” I little thought what it was , little thought in how short a time I should understand it better , but I assured him that I had confidence in him .
“ So you may have , my dear , ” he returned .
“ And I tell you what !
If you only repose half as much confidence in me as I repose in you after what I ’ ve experienced of you , that ’ ll do .
Lord !
You ’ re no trouble at all .
I never see a young woman in any station of society — and I ’ ve seen many elevated ones too — conduct herself like you have conducted yourself since you was called out of your bed .
You ’ re a pattern , you know , that ’ s what you are , ” said Mr. Bucket <unk> ; “ you ’ re a pattern . ” I told him I was very glad , as indeed I was , to have been no <unk> to him , and that I hoped I should be none now .
“ My dear , ” he returned , “ when a young lady is as mild as she ’ s game , and as game as she ’ s mild , that ’ s all I ask , and more than I expect .
She then becomes a queen , and that ’ s about what you are yourself . ” With these encouraging words — they really were encouraging to me under those lonely and anxious circumstances — he got upon the box , and we once more drove away .
Where we drove I neither knew then nor have ever known since , but we appeared to seek out the <unk> and worst streets in London .
Whenever I saw him directing the driver , I was prepared for our <unk> into a deeper <unk> of such streets , and we never failed to do so .
Sometimes we <unk> upon a <unk> thoroughfare or came to a larger building than the <unk> , well lighted .
Then we stopped at offices like those we had visited when we began our journey , and I saw him in <unk> with others .
Sometimes he would get down by an archway or at a street corner and mysteriously show the light of his little lantern .
This would <unk> similar lights from various dark quarters , like so many <unk> , and a fresh <unk> would be held .
By degrees we appeared to <unk> our search within <unk> and easier limits .
<unk> <unk> on duty could now tell Mr. Bucket what he wanted to know and point to him where to go .
At last we stopped for a rather long conversation between him and one of these men , which I supposed to be satisfactory from his manner of nodding from time to time .
When it was finished he came to me looking very busy and very attentive .
“ Now , Miss Summerson , ” he said to me , “ you won ’ t be alarmed whatever comes off , I know .
It ’ s not necessary for me to give you any further caution than to tell you that we have marked this person down and that you may be of use to me before I know it myself .
I don ’ t like to ask such a thing , my dear , but would you walk a little way ? ” Of course I got out directly and took his arm .
“ It ain ’ t so easy to keep your feet , ” said Mr. Bucket , “ but take time . ” Although I looked about me <unk> and hurriedly as we crossed the street , I thought I knew the place .
“ Are we in Holborn ? ” I asked him .
“ Yes , ” said Mr. Bucket .
“ Do you know this turning ? ” “ It looks like Chancery Lane . ” “ And was christened so , my dear , ” said Mr. Bucket .
We turned down it , and as we went shuffling through the sleet , I heard the clocks strike half-past five .
We passed on in silence and as quickly as we could with such a <unk> , when some one coming towards us on the narrow pavement , wrapped in a cloak , stopped and stood aside to give me room .
In the same moment I heard an exclamation of wonder and my own name from Mr. Woodcourt .
I knew his voice very well .
It was so unexpected and so — I don ’ t know what to call it , whether pleasant or painful — to come upon it after my <unk> wandering journey , and in the midst of the night , that I could not keep back the tears from my eyes .
It was like hearing his voice in a strange country .
“ My dear Miss Summerson , that you should be out at this hour , and in such weather ! ” He had heard from my guardian of my having been called away on some uncommon business and said so to dispense with any explanation .
I told him that we had but just left a coach and were going — but then I was obliged to look at my companion .
“ Why , you see , Mr. Woodcourt ” — he had caught the name from me — “ we are a-going at present into the next street .
Inspector Bucket . ” Mr. Woodcourt , <unk> my <unk> , had hurriedly taken off his cloak and was putting it about me .
“ That ’ s a good move , too , ” said Mr. Bucket , assisting , “ a very good move . ” “ May I go with you ? ” said Mr. Woodcourt .
I don ’ t know whether to me or to my companion .
“ Why , Lord ! ” exclaimed Mr. Bucket , taking the answer on himself .
“ Of course you may . ” It was all said in a moment , and they took me between them , wrapped in the cloak .
“ I have just left Richard , ” said Mr. Woodcourt .
“ I have been sitting with him since ten o ’ clock last night . ” “ Oh , dear me , he is ill ! ” “ No , no , believe me ; not ill , but not quite well .
He was depressed and faint — you know he gets so <unk> and so worn sometimes — and Ada sent to me of course ; and when I came home I found her note and came straight here .
Well !
Richard revived so much after a little while , and Ada was so happy and so convinced of its being my doing , though God knows I had little enough to do with it , that I remained with him until he had been fast asleep some hours .
As fast asleep as she is now , I hope ! ” His friendly and familiar way of speaking of them , his <unk> devotion to them , the grateful confidence with which I knew he had inspired my darling , and the comfort he was to her ; could I separate all this from his promise to me ?
How <unk> I must have been if it had not recalled the words he said to me when he was so moved by the change in my appearance : “ I will accept him as a trust , and it shall be a sacred one ! ” We now turned into another narrow street .
“ Mr.
Woodcourt , ” said Mr. Bucket , who had eyed him closely as we came along , “ our business takes us to a law-stationer ’ s here , a certain Mr. Snagsby ’ s .
What , you know him , do you ? ” He was so quick that he saw it in an instant .
“ Yes , I know a little of him and have called upon him at this place . ” “ Indeed , sir ? ” said Mr. Bucket .
“ Then you will be so good as to let me leave Miss Summerson with you for a moment while I go and have half a word with him ? ” The last <unk> with whom he had <unk> was standing silently behind us .
I was not aware of it until he struck in on my saying I heard some one crying .
“ Don ’ t be alarmed , miss , ” he returned .
“ It ’ s Snagsby ’ s servant . ” “ Why , you see , ” said Mr. Bucket , “ the girl ’ s subject to fits , and has ’ em bad upon her to-night .
A most contrary circumstance it is , for I want certain information out of that girl , and she must be brought to reason somehow . ” “ At all events , they wouldn ’ t be up yet if it wasn ’ t for her , Mr. Bucket , ” said the other man .
“ She ’ s been at it pretty well all night , sir . ” “ Well , that ’ s true , ” he returned .
“ My light ’ s burnt out .
<unk> yours a moment . ” All this passed in a whisper a door or two from the house in which I could faintly hear crying and <unk> .
In the little round of light produced for the purpose , Mr. Bucket went up to the door and knocked .
The door was opened after he had knocked twice , and he went in , leaving us standing in the street .
“ Miss Summerson , ” said Mr. Woodcourt , “ if without <unk> myself on your confidence I may remain near you , pray let me do so . ” “ You are truly kind , ” I answered .
“ I need wish to keep no secret of my own from you ; if I keep any , it is another ’ s . ” “ I quite understand .
Trust me , I will remain near you only so long as I can fully respect it . ” “ I trust <unk> to you , ” I said .
“ I know and deeply feel how <unk> you keep your promise . ” After a short time the little round of light shone out again , and Mr. Bucket advanced towards us in it with his earnest face .
“ Please to come in , Miss Summerson , ” he said , “ and sit down by the fire .
Mr. Woodcourt , from information I have received I understand you are a medical man .
Would you look to this girl and see if anything can be done to bring her round .
She has a letter somewhere that I particularly want .
It ’ s not in her box , and I think it must be about her ; but she is so twisted and <unk> up that she is difficult to handle without hurting . ” We all three went into the house together ; although it was cold and raw , it <unk> close too from being up all night .
In the passage behind the door stood a <unk> , <unk> little man in a grey coat who seemed to have a naturally polite manner and spoke <unk> .
“ <unk> , if you please , Mr. Bucket , ” said he .
“ The lady will excuse the front kitchen ; we use it as our <unk> sitting-room .
The back is Guster ’ s bedroom , and in it she ’ s <unk> on , poor thing , to a <unk> extent ! ” We went downstairs , followed by Mr. Snagsby , as I soon found the little man to be .
In the front kitchen , sitting by the fire , was Mrs. Snagsby , with very red eyes and a very severe expression of face .
“ My little woman , ” said Mr. Snagsby , entering behind us , “ to wave — not to put too fine a point upon it , my dear — <unk> for one single moment in the course of this <unk> night , here is Inspector Bucket , Mr. Woodcourt , and a lady . ” She looked very much astonished , as she had reason for doing , and looked particularly hard at me .
“ My little woman , ” said Mr. Snagsby , sitting down in the remotest corner by the door , as if he were taking a liberty , “ it is not unlikely that you may inquire of me why Inspector Bucket , Mr. Woodcourt , and a lady call upon us in Cook ’ s Court , Cursitor Street , at the present hour .
I don ’ t know .
I have not the least idea .
If I was to be informed , I should despair of understanding , and I ’ d rather not be told . ” He appeared so miserable , sitting with his head upon his hand , and I appeared so <unk> , that I was going to offer an apology when Mr. Bucket took the matter on himself .
“ Now , Mr. Snagsby , ” said he , “ the best thing you can do is to go along with Mr. Woodcourt to look after your Guster — ” “ My Guster , Mr. Bucket ! ” cried Mr. Snagsby .
“ Go on , sir , go on .
I shall be charged with that next . ” “ And to hold the candle , ” pursued Mr. Bucket without correcting himself , “ or hold her , or make yourself useful in any way you ’ re asked .
Which there ’ s not a man alive more ready to do , for you ’ re a man of <unk> and <unk> , you know , and you ’ ve got the sort of heart that can feel for another .
Mr. Woodcourt , would you be so good as see to her , and if you can get that letter from her , to let me have it as soon as ever you can ? ” As they went out , Mr. Bucket made me sit down in a corner by the fire and take off my wet shoes , which he turned up to dry upon the <unk> , talking all the time .
“ Don ’ t you be at all put out , miss , by the want of a hospitable look from Mrs. Snagsby there , because she ’ s under a mistake altogether .
She ’ ll find that out sooner than will be agreeable to a lady of her generally correct manner of <unk> her thoughts , because I ’ m a-going to explain it to her . ” Here , standing on the hearth with his wet hat and <unk> in his hand , himself a pile of wet , he turned to Mrs. Snagsby .
“ Now , the first thing that I say to you , as a married woman possessing what you may call charms , you know — ‘ <unk> Me , if All Those <unk> , ’ and <unk> — you ’ re well acquainted with the song , because it ’ s in vain for you to tell me that you and good society are <unk> — charms — attractions , mind you , that ought to give you confidence in yourself — is , that you ’ ve done it . ” Mrs. Snagsby looked rather alarmed , <unk> a little and <unk> , what did Mr. Bucket mean .
“ What does Mr. Bucket mean ? ” he repeated , and I saw by his face that all the time he talked he was listening for the discovery of the letter , to my own great agitation , for I knew then how important it must be ; “ I ’ ll tell you what he means , ma ’ am .
Go and see <unk> <unk> .
That ’ s the <unk> for you . ” Mrs. Snagsby <unk> asked why .
“ Why ? ” said Mr. Bucket .
“ Because you ’ ll come to that if you don ’ t look out .
Why , at the very moment while I speak , I know what your mind ’ s not wholly free from respecting this young lady .
But shall I tell you who this young lady is ?
Now , come , you ’ re what I call an intellectual woman — with your soul too large for your body , if you come to that , and <unk> it — and you know me , and you recollect where you saw me last , and what was talked of in that circle .
Don ’ t you ?
Yes !
Very well .
This young lady is that young lady . ” Mrs. Snagsby appeared to understand the reference better than I did at the time .
“ And Toughey — him as you call Jo — was mixed up in the same business , and no other ; and the law-writer that you know of was mixed up in the same business , and no other ; and your husband , with no more knowledge of it than your great grandfather , was mixed up ( by Mr. Tulkinghorn , deceased , his best customer ) in the same business , and no other ; and the whole <unk> of people was mixed up in the same business , and no other .
And yet a married woman , possessing your attractions , shuts her eyes ( and <unk> too ) , and goes and runs her <unk> head against a wall .
Why , I am ashamed of you !
( I expected Mr. Woodcourt might have got it by this time .
) ” Mrs. Snagsby shook her head and put her handkerchief to her eyes .
“ Is that all ? ” said Mr. Bucket <unk> .
“ No .
See what happens .
Another person mixed up in that business and no other , a person in a wretched state , comes here to-night and is seen <unk> to your <unk> ; and between her and your <unk> there passes a paper that I would give a hundred pound for , down .
What do you do ?
You hide and you watch ’ em , and you <unk> upon that <unk> — knowing what she ’ s subject to and what a little thing will bring ’ em on — in that surprising manner and with that severity that , by the Lord , she goes off and keeps off , when a life may be hanging upon that girl ’ s words ! ” He so thoroughly meant what he said now that I <unk> clasped my hands and felt the room turning away from me .
But it stopped .
Mr. Woodcourt came in , put a paper into his hand , and went away again .
“ Now , Mrs. Snagsby , the only <unk> you can make , ” said Mr. Bucket , rapidly glancing at it , “ is to let me speak a word to this young lady in private here .
And if you know of any help that you can give to that gentleman in the next kitchen there or can think of any one thing that ’ s <unk> than another to bring the girl round , do your <unk> and best ! ” In an instant she was gone , and he had shut the door .
“ Now my dear , you ’ re steady and quite sure of yourself ? ” “ Quite , ” said I.
“ <unk> writing is that ? ” It was my mother ’ s .
A <unk> , on a crushed and torn piece of paper , blotted with wet .
<unk> <unk> like a letter , and directed to me at my guardian ’ s .
“ You know the hand , ” he said , “ and if you are firm enough to read it to me , do !
But be particular to a word . ” It had been written in <unk> , at different times .
I read what follows : I came to the cottage with two objects .
First , to see the dear one , if I could , once more — but only to see her — not to speak to her or let her know that I was near .
The other object , to <unk> pursuit and to be lost .
Do not blame the mother for her share .
The assistance that she rendered me , she rendered on my strongest assurance that it was for the dear one ’ s good .
You remember her dead child .
The men ’ s consent I bought , but her help was freely given .
“ ‘ I came . ’ That was written , ” said my companion , “ when she rested there .
It bears out what I made of it .
I was right . ” The next was written at another time : I have wandered a long distance , and for many hours , and I know that I must soon die .
These streets !
I have no purpose but to die .
When I left , I had a worse , but I am saved from adding that <unk> to the rest .
<unk> , wet , and fatigue are sufficient causes for my being found dead , but I shall die of others , though I suffer from these .
It was right that all that had <unk> me should give way at once and that I should die of terror and my conscience .
“ Take courage , ” said Mr. Bucket .
“ There ’ s only a few words more . ” Those , too , were written at another time .
To all appearance , almost in the dark : I have done all I could do to be lost .
I shall be soon forgotten so , and shall disgrace him least .
I have nothing about me by which I can be recognized .
This paper I part with now .
The place where I shall lie down , if I can get so far , has been often in my mind .
<unk> .
<unk> .
Mr. Bucket , <unk> me with his arm , <unk> me gently into my chair .
“ <unk> up !
Don ’ t think me hard with you , my dear , but as soon as ever you feel equal to it , get your shoes on and be ready . ” I did as he required , but I was left there a long time , <unk> for my unhappy mother .
They were all occupied with the poor girl , and I heard Mr. Woodcourt directing them and speaking to her often .
At length he came in with Mr. Bucket and said that as it was important to address her gently , he thought it best that I should ask her for whatever information we desired to obtain .
There was no doubt that she could now reply to questions if she were <unk> and not alarmed .
The questions , Mr. Bucket said , were how she came by the letter , what passed between her and the person who gave her the letter , and where the person went .
<unk> my mind as steadily as I could to these points , I went into the next room with them .
Mr. Woodcourt would have remained outside , but at my <unk> went in with us .
The poor girl was sitting on the floor where they had laid her down .
They stood around her , though at a little distance , that she might have air .
She was not pretty and looked weak and poor , but she had a plaintive and a good face , though it was still a little wild .
I <unk> on the ground beside her and put her poor head upon my shoulder , <unk> she drew her arm round my neck and burst into tears .
“ My poor girl , ” said I , laying my face against her forehead , for indeed I was crying too , and trembling , “ it seems cruel to trouble you now , but more <unk> on our knowing something about this letter than I could tell you in an hour . ” She began <unk> <unk> that she didn ’ t mean any harm , she didn ’ t mean any harm , Mrs. Snagsby !
“ We are all sure of that , ” said I.
“ But pray tell me how you got it . ” “ Yes , dear lady , I will , and tell you true .
I ’ ll tell true , indeed , Mrs. Snagsby . ” “ I am sure of that , ” said I.
“ And how was it ? ” “ I had been out on an errand , dear lady — long after it was dark — quite late ; and when I came home , I found a <unk> person , all wet and muddy , looking up at our house .
When she saw me coming in at the door , she called me back and said did I live here .
And I said yes , and she said she knew only one or two places about here , but had lost her way and couldn ’ t find them .
Oh , what shall I do , what shall I do !
They won ’ t believe me !
She didn ’ t say any harm to me , and I didn ’ t say any harm to her , indeed , Mrs. Snagsby ! ” It was necessary for her mistress to comfort her — which she did , I must say , with a good deal of <unk> — before she could be got beyond this .
“ She could not find those places , ” said I.
“ No ! ” cried the girl , shaking her head .
“ No !
<unk> ’ t find them .
And she was so faint , and lame , and miserable , Oh so wretched , that if you had seen her , Mr. Snagsby , you ’ d have given her half a crown , I know ! ” “ Well , Guster , my girl , ” said he , at first not knowing what to say .
“ I hope I should . ” “ And yet she was so well spoken , ” said the girl , looking at me with wide open eyes , “ that it made a person ’ s heart <unk> .
And so she said to me , did I know the way to the burying ground ?
And I asked her which burying ground .
And she said , the poor burying ground .
And so I told her I had been a poor child myself , and it was according to <unk> .
But she said she meant a poor burying ground not very far from here , where there was an archway , and a step , and an iron gate . ” As I watched her face and <unk> her to go on , I saw that Mr. Bucket received this with a look which I could not separate from one of alarm .
“ Oh , dear , dear ! ” cried the girl , pressing her hair back with her hands .
“ What shall I do , what shall I do !
She meant the burying ground where the man was buried that took the <unk> — that you came home and told us of , Mr. Snagsby — that frightened me so , Mrs. Snagsby .
Oh , I am frightened again .
Hold me ! ” “ You are so much better now , ” <unk> I.
“ Pray , pray tell me more . ” “ Yes I will , yes I will !
But don ’ t be angry with me , that ’ s a dear lady , because I have been so ill . ” <unk> with her , poor soul !
“ There !
Now I will , now I will .
So she said , could I tell her how to find it , and I said yes , and I told her ; and she looked at me with eyes like almost as if she was blind , and herself all waving back .
And so she took out the letter , and showed it me , and said if she was to put that in the post-office , it would be rubbed out and not <unk> and never sent ; and would I take it from her , and send it , and the messenger would be paid at the house .
And so I said yes , if it was no harm , and she said no — no harm .
And so I took it from her , and she said she had nothing to give me , and I said I was poor myself and consequently wanted nothing .
And so she said God bless you , and went . ” “ And did she go — ” “ Yes , ” cried the girl , anticipating the inquiry .
“ Yes !
She went the way I had shown her .
Then I came in , and Mrs. Snagsby came behind me from somewhere and laid hold of me , and I was frightened . ” Mr. Woodcourt took her kindly from me .
Mr. Bucket wrapped me up , and immediately we were in the street .
Mr. Woodcourt <unk> , but I said , “ Don ’ t leave me now ! ” and Mr. Bucket added , “ You ’ ll be better with us , we may want you ; don ’ t lose time ! ” I have the most confused impressions of that walk .
I recollect that it was neither night nor day , that morning was <unk> but the <unk> were not yet put out , that the sleet was still falling and that all the ways were deep with it .
I recollect a few chilled people passing in the streets .
I recollect the wet <unk> , the <unk> and bursting <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> of blackened <unk> and snow over which we passed , the <unk> of the courts by which we went .
At the same time I remember that the poor girl seemed to be yet telling her story <unk> and plainly in my hearing , that I could feel her resting on my arm , that the stained <unk> put on human shapes and looked at me , that great <unk> seemed to be opening and closing in my head or in the air , and that the <unk> things were more <unk> than the real .
At last we stood under a dark and miserable covered way , where one lamp was burning over an iron gate and where the morning faintly <unk> in .
The gate was closed .
<unk> it was a <unk> ground — a dreadful spot in which the night was very slowly stirring , but where I could dimly see heaps of <unk> graves and stones , <unk> in by <unk> houses with a few dull lights in their windows and on whose walls a thick <unk> broke out like a <unk> .
On the step at the gate , <unk> in the fearful wet of such a place , which <unk> and <unk> down everywhere , I saw , with a cry of pity and horror , a woman lying — Jenny , the mother of the dead child .
I ran forward , but they stopped me , and Mr. Woodcourt entreated me with the greatest earnestness , even with tears , before I went up to the figure to listen for an instant to what Mr. Bucket said .
I did so , as I thought .
I did so , as I am sure .
“ Miss Summerson , you ’ ll understand me , if you think a moment .
They changed clothes at the cottage . ” They changed clothes at the cottage .
I could repeat the words in my mind , and I knew what they meant of themselves , but I attached no meaning to them in any other connexion .
“ And one returned , ” said Mr. Bucket , “ and one went on .
And the one that went on only went on a certain way agreed upon to deceive and then turned across country and went home .
Think a moment ! ” I could repeat this in my mind too , but I had not the least idea what it meant .
I saw before me , lying on the step , the mother of the dead child .
She lay there with one arm creeping round a bar of the iron gate and seeming to embrace it .
She lay there , who had so lately spoken to my mother .
She lay there , a distressed , <unk> , <unk> creature .
She who had brought my mother ’ s letter , who could give me the only clue to where my mother was ; she , who was to guide us to <unk> and save her whom we had sought so far , who had come to this condition by some means connected with my mother that I could not follow , and might be passing beyond our reach and help at that moment ; she lay there , and they stopped me !
I saw but did not comprehend the solemn and compassionate look in Mr. Woodcourt ’ s face .
I saw but did not comprehend his touching the other on the breast to keep him back .
I saw him stand <unk> in the bitter air , with a <unk> for something .
But my understanding for all this was gone .
I even heard it said between them , “ Shall she go ? ” “ She had better go .
Her hands should be the first to touch her .
They have a higher right than ours . ” I passed on to the gate and stooped down .
I lifted the heavy head , put the long <unk> hair aside , and turned the face .
And it was my mother , cold and dead .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> I proceed to other passages of my narrative .
From the goodness of all about me I derived such consolation as I can never think of unmoved .
I have already said so much of myself , and so much still remains , that I will not <unk> upon my sorrow .
I had an illness , but it was not a long one ; and I would avoid even this mention of it if I could quite keep down the recollection of their sympathy .
I proceed to other passages of my narrative .
During the time of my illness , we were still in London , where Mrs. Woodcourt had come , on my guardian ’ s <unk> , to stay with us .
When my guardian thought me well and cheerful enough to talk with him in our old way — though I could have done that sooner if he would have believed me — I resumed my work and my chair beside his .
He had appointed the time himself , and we were alone .
“ Dame Trot , ” said he , receiving me with a kiss , “ welcome to the growlery again , my dear .
I have a scheme to <unk> , little woman .
I propose to remain here , perhaps for six months , perhaps for a longer time — as it may be .
Quite to settle here for a while , in short . ” “ And in the meanwhile leave Bleak House ? ” said I.
“ Aye , my dear ?
Bleak House , ” he returned , “ must learn to take care of itself . ” I thought his tone sounded sorrowful , but looking at him , I saw his kind face lighted up by its pleasantest smile .
“ Bleak House , ” he repeated — and his tone did NOT sound sorrowful , I found — “ must learn to take care of itself .
It is a long way from Ada , my dear , and Ada stands much in need of you . ” “ It ’ s like you , guardian , ” said I , “ to have been taking that into consideration for a happy surprise to both of us . ” “ Not so disinterested either , my dear , if you mean to <unk> me for that virtue , since if you were generally on the road , you could be seldom with me .
And besides , I wish to hear as much and as often of Ada as I can in this condition of <unk> from poor Rick .
Not of her alone , but of him too , poor fellow . ” “ Have you seen Mr. Woodcourt , this morning , guardian ? ” “ I see Mr. Woodcourt every morning , Dame Durden . ” “ Does he still say the same of Richard ? ” “ Just the same .
He knows of no direct bodily illness that he has ; on the contrary , he believes that he has none .
Yet he is not easy about him ; who CAN be ? ” My dear girl had been to see us lately every day , some times twice in a day .
But we had <unk> , all along , that this would only last until I was quite myself .
We knew full well that her <unk> heart was as full of affection and gratitude towards her cousin John as it had ever been , and we <unk> Richard of laying any injunctions upon her to stay away ; but we knew on the other hand that she felt it a part of her duty to him to be sparing of her visits at our house .
My guardian ’ s delicacy had soon perceived this and had tried to <unk> to her that he thought she was right .
“ Dear , unfortunate , mistaken Richard , ” said I.
“ When will he awake from his <unk> ! ” “ He is not in the way to do so now , my dear , ” replied my guardian .
“ The more he <unk> , the more <unk> he will be to me , having made me the principal representative of the great occasion of his suffering . ” I could not help adding , “ So <unk> ! ” “ Ah , Dame Trot , Dame Trot , ” returned my guardian , “ what shall we find reasonable in Jarndyce and Jarndyce !
<unk> and injustice at the top , <unk> and injustice at the heart and at the bottom , <unk> and injustice from beginning to end — if it ever has an end — how should poor Rick , always hovering near it , <unk> reason out of it ?
He no more <unk> <unk> from <unk> or <unk> from <unk> than older men did in old times . ” His gentleness and consideration for Richard whenever we spoke of him touched me so that I was always silent on this subject very soon .
“ I suppose the Lord Chancellor , and the <unk> Chancellors , and the whole Chancery <unk> of great guns would be infinitely astonished by such <unk> and injustice in one of their suitors , ” pursued my guardian .
“ When those learned gentlemen begin to raise <unk> from the powder they <unk> in their wigs , I shall begin to be astonished too ! ” He checked himself in glancing towards the window to look where the wind was and leaned on the back of my chair instead .
“ Well , well , little woman !
To go on , my dear .
This rock we must leave to time , chance , and hopeful circumstance .
We must not shipwreck Ada upon it .
She cannot afford , and he cannot afford , the remotest chance of another separation from a friend .
Therefore I have particularly begged of Woodcourt , and I now particularly beg of you , my dear , not to move this subject with Rick .
Let it rest .
Next week , next month , next year , sooner or later , he will see me with clearer eyes .
I can wait . ” But I had already discussed it with him , I confessed ; and so , I thought , had Mr. Woodcourt .
“ So he tells me , ” returned my guardian .
“ Very good .
He has made his protest , and Dame Durden has made hers , and there is nothing more to be said about it .
Now I come to Mrs. Woodcourt .
How do you like her , my dear ? ” In answer to this question , which was <unk> <unk> , I said I liked her very much and thought she was more agreeable than she used to be .
“ I think so too , ” said my guardian .
“ <unk> <unk> ?
Not so much of Morgan <unk> — what ’ s his name ? ” That was what I meant , I acknowledged , though he was a very harmless person , even when we had had more of him .
“ Still , upon the whole , he is as well in his native mountains , ” said my guardian .
“ I agree with you .
Then , little woman , can I do better for a time than retain Mrs. Woodcourt here ? ” No .
And yet — My guardian looked at me , waiting for what I had to say .
I had nothing to say .
At least I had nothing in my mind that I could say .
I had an <unk> impression that it might have been better if we had had some other <unk> , but I could hardly have explained why even to myself .
Or , if to myself , certainly not to anybody else .
“ You see , ” said my guardian , “ our neighbourhood is in Woodcourt ’ s way , and he can come here to see her as often as he likes , which is agreeable to them both ; and she is familiar to us and fond of you . ” Yes .
That was <unk> .
I had nothing to say against it .
I could not have suggested a better arrangement , but I was not quite easy in my mind .
Esther , Esther , why not ?
Esther , think !
“ It is a very good plan indeed , dear guardian , and we could not do better . ” “ <unk> , little woman ? ” Quite sure .
I had had a moment ’ s time to think , since I had urged that duty on myself , and I was quite sure .
“ Good , ” said my guardian .
“ It shall be done .
<unk> <unk> . ” “ <unk> <unk> , ” I repeated , going on with my work .
It was a cover for his <unk> that I happened to be <unk> .
It had been laid by on the night <unk> my sad journey and never resumed .
I showed it to him now , and he admired it highly .
After I had explained the pattern to him and all the great effects that were to come out by and by , I thought I would go back to our last theme .
“ You said , dear guardian , when we spoke of Mr. Woodcourt before Ada left us , that you thought he would give a long trial to another country .
Have you been <unk> him since ? ” “ Yes , little woman , pretty often . ” “ Has he decided to do so ? ” “ I rather think not . ” “ Some other prospect has opened to him , perhaps ? ” said I.
“ Why — yes — perhaps , ” returned my guardian , beginning his answer in a very <unk> manner .
“ About half a year hence or so , there is a medical attendant for the poor to be appointed at a certain place in <unk> .
It is a <unk> place , pleasantly situated — streams and streets , town and country , mill and <unk> — and seems to present an opening for such a man .
I mean a man whose hopes and <unk> may sometimes lie ( as most men ’ s sometimes do , I dare say ) above the ordinary level , but to whom the ordinary level will be high enough after all if it should prove to be a way of <unk> and good service leading to no other .
All generous spirits are <unk> , I suppose , but the ambition that calmly trusts itself to such a road , instead of <unk> trying to fly over it , is of the kind I care for .
It is Woodcourt ’ s kind . ” “ And will he get this appointment ? ” I asked .
“ Why , little woman , ” returned my guardian , smiling , “ not being an <unk> , I cannot confidently say , but I think so .
His reputation stands very high ; there were people from that part of the country in the shipwreck ; and strange to say , I believe the best man has the best chance .
You must not suppose it to be a fine <unk> .
It is a very , very <unk> affair , my dear , an appointment to a great amount of work and a small amount of pay ; but better things will <unk> about it , it may be <unk> hoped . ” “ The poor of that place will have reason to bless the choice if it falls on Mr. Woodcourt , guardian . ” “ You are right , little woman ; that I am sure they will . ” We said no more about it , nor did he say a word about the future of Bleak House .
But it was the first time I had taken my seat at his side in my mourning dress , and that <unk> for it , I considered .
I now began to visit my dear girl every day in the dull dark corner where she lived .
The morning was my usual time , but whenever I found I had an hour or so to spare , I put on my bonnet and <unk> off to Chancery Lane .
They were both so glad to see me at all hours , and used to brighten up so when they heard me opening the door and coming in ( being quite at home , I never knocked ) , that I had no fear of becoming troublesome just yet .
On these occasions I frequently found Richard absent .
At other times he would be writing or reading papers in the cause at that table of his , so covered with papers , which was never disturbed .
Sometimes I would come upon him lingering at the door of Mr. Vholes ’ s office .
Sometimes I would meet him in the neighbourhood <unk> about and biting his <unk> .
I often met him wandering in Lincoln ’ s Inn , near the place where I had first seen him , oh how different , how different !
That the money Ada brought him was melting away with the candles I used to see burning after dark in Mr. Vholes ’ s office I knew very well .
It was not a large amount in the beginning , he had married in debt , and I could not fail to understand , by this time , what was meant by Mr. Vholes ’ s shoulder being at the wheel — as I still heard it was .
My dear made the best of <unk> and tried hard to save , but I knew that they were getting poorer and poorer every day .
She shone in the miserable corner like a beautiful star .
She <unk> and <unk> it so that it became another place .
<unk> than she had been at home , and a little quieter than I had thought natural when she was yet so cheerful and hopeful , her face was so <unk> that I half believed she was <unk> by her love for Richard to his <unk> career .
I went one day to dine with them while I was under this impression .
As I turned into Symond ’ s Inn , I met little Miss Flite coming out .
She had been to make a stately call upon the wards in Jarndyce , as she still called them , and had derived the highest gratification from that ceremony .
Ada had already told me that she called every <unk> at five o ’ clock , with one little extra white bow in her bonnet , which never appeared there at any other time , and with her <unk> reticule of documents on her arm .
“ My dear ! ” she began .
“ So delighted !
How do you do !
So glad to see you .
And you are going to visit our interesting Jarndyce wards ?
TO be sure !
Our beauty is at home , my dear , and will be charmed to see you . ” “ Then Richard is not come in yet ? ” said I.
“ I am glad of that , for I was afraid of being a little late . ” “ No , he is not come in , ” returned Miss Flite .
“ He has had a long day in court .
I left him there with Vholes .
You don ’ t like Vholes , I hope ?
DON ’ T like Vholes .
<unk> man ! ” “ I am afraid you see Richard oftener than ever now , ” said I.
“ My dearest , ” returned Miss Flite , “ daily and <unk> .
You know what I told you of the attraction on the Chancellor ’ s table ?
My dear , next to myself he is the most constant suitor in court .
He begins quite to <unk> our little party .
Ve-ry friendly little party , are we not ? ” It was miserable to hear this from her poor mad lips , though it was no surprise .
“ In short , my <unk> friend , ” pursued Miss Flite , advancing her lips to my ear with an air of equal patronage and mystery , “ I must tell you a secret .
I have made him my <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , and appointed him .
In my will .
Ye-es . ” “ Indeed ? ” said I.
“ Ye-es , ” repeated Miss Flite in her most genteel <unk> , “ my <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
( Our Chancery <unk> , my love . )
I have reflected that if I should wear out , he will be able to watch that judgment .
Being so very regular in his attendance . ” It made me sigh to think of him .
“ I did at one time mean , ” said Miss Flite , echoing the sigh , “ to <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> poor Gridley .
Also very regular , my charming girl .
I assure you , most exemplary !
But he wore out , poor man , so I have appointed his <unk> .
Don ’ t mention it .
This is in confidence . ” She carefully opened her reticule a little way and showed me a folded piece of paper inside as the appointment of which she spoke .
“ Another secret , my dear .
I have added to my collection of birds . ” “ Really , Miss Flite ? ” said I , knowing how it pleased her to have her confidence received with an appearance of interest .
She nodded several times , and her face became <unk> and gloomy .
“ Two more .
I call them the <unk> in Jarndyce .
They are <unk> up with all the others .
With <unk> , Joy , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Death , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ! ” The poor soul kissed me with the most troubled look I had ever seen in her and went her way .
Her manner of running over the names of her birds , as if she were afraid of hearing them even from her own lips , quite chilled me .
This was not a <unk> preparation for my visit , and I could have dispensed with the company of Mr. Vholes , when Richard ( who arrived within a minute or two after me ) brought him to share our dinner .
Although it was a very plain one , Ada and Richard were for some minutes both out of the room together helping to get ready what we were to eat and drink .
Mr. Vholes took that opportunity of holding a little conversation in a low voice with me .
He came to the window where I was sitting and began upon Symond ’ s Inn .
“ A dull place , Miss Summerson , for a life that is not an official one , ” said Mr. Vholes , <unk> the glass with his black glove to make it clearer for me .
“ There is not much to see here , ” said I.
“ Nor to hear , miss , ” returned Mr. Vholes .
“ A little music does occasionally stray in , but we are not musical in the law and soon <unk> it .
I hope Mr. Jarndyce is as well as his friends could wish him ? ” I thanked Mr. Vholes and said he was quite well .
“ I have not the pleasure to be admitted among the number of his friends myself , ” said Mr. Vholes , “ and I am aware that the gentlemen of our profession are sometimes regarded in such quarters with an <unk> eye .
Our plain course , however , under good report and evil report , and all kinds of prejudice ( we are the <unk> of prejudice ) , is to have everything openly carried on .
How do you find Mr. C. looking , Miss Summerson ? ” “ He looks very ill . <unk> anxious . ” “ Just so , ” said Mr. Vholes .
He stood behind me with his long black figure <unk> nearly to the ceiling of those low rooms , feeling the <unk> on his face as if they were ornaments and speaking <unk> and <unk> as though there were not a human passion or emotion in his nature .
“ Mr.
Woodcourt is in attendance upon Mr. C. , I believe ? ” he resumed .
“ Mr.
Woodcourt is his disinterested friend , ” I answered .
“ But I mean in professional attendance , medical attendance . ” “ That can do little for an unhappy mind , ” said I.
“ Just so , ” said Mr. Vholes .
So slow , so eager , so <unk> and gaunt , I felt as if Richard were <unk> away beneath the eyes of this adviser and there were something of the <unk> in him .
“ Miss Summerson , ” said Mr. Vholes , very slowly rubbing his <unk> hands , as if , to his cold sense of touch , they were much the same in black <unk> or out of it , “ this was an <unk> marriage of Mr. C. ’ s . ” I begged he would excuse me from <unk> it .
They had been engaged when they were both very young , I told him ( a little indignantly ) and when the prospect before them was much <unk> and brighter .
When Richard had not yielded himself to the unhappy influence which now darkened his life .
“ Just so , ” assented Mr. Vholes again .
“ Still , with a view to everything being openly carried on , I will , with your permission , Miss Summerson , observe to you that I consider this a very <unk> marriage indeed .
I owe the opinion not only to Mr. C. ’ s connexions , against whom I should naturally wish to protect myself , but also to my own reputation — dear to myself as a professional man <unk> to keep respectable ; dear to my three girls at home , for whom I am striving to <unk> some little independence ; dear , I will even say , to my aged father , whom it is my privilege to support . ” “ It would become a very different marriage , a much happier and better marriage , another marriage altogether , Mr. Vholes , ” said I , “ if Richard were persuaded to turn his back on the fatal pursuit in which you are engaged with him . ” Mr. Vholes , with a <unk> cough — or rather gasp — into one of his black gloves , inclined his head as if he did not wholly dispute even that .
“ Miss Summerson , ” he said , “ it may be so ; and I freely admit that the young lady who has taken Mr. C. ’ s name upon herself in so <unk> a manner — you will I am sure not quarrel with me for throwing out that remark again , as a duty I owe to Mr. C. ’ s connexions — is a highly genteel young lady .
<unk> has prevented me from <unk> much with general society in any but a professional character ; still I trust I am <unk> to perceive that she is a highly genteel young lady .
As to beauty , I am not a judge of that myself , and I never did give much attention to it from a boy , but I dare say the young lady is equally <unk> in that point of view .
She is considered so ( I have heard ) among the clerks in the Inn , and it is a point more in their way than in mine .
In reference to Mr. C. ’ s pursuit of his interests — ” “ Oh !
His interests , Mr. Vholes ! ” “ Pardon me , ” returned Mr. Vholes , going on in exactly the same inward and <unk> manner .
“ Mr.
C. takes certain interests under certain wills disputed in the suit .
It is a term we use .
In reference to Mr. <unk> , ’ s pursuit of his interests , I mentioned to you , Miss Summerson , the first time I had the pleasure of seeing you , in my desire that everything should be openly carried on — I used those words , for I happened afterwards to note them in my <unk> , which is <unk> at any time — I mentioned to you that Mr. C. had laid down the principle of watching his own interests , and that when a client of mine laid down a principle which was not of an <unk> ( that is to say , <unk> ) nature , it <unk> upon me to carry it out .
I HAVE carried it out ; I do carry it out .
But I will not smooth things over to any connexion of Mr. C. ’ s on any account .
As open as I was to Mr. Jarndyce , I am to you .
I regard it in the light of a professional duty to be so , though it can be charged to no one .
I openly say , <unk> as it may be , that I consider Mr. C. ’ s affairs in a very bad way , that I consider Mr. C. himself in a very bad way , and that I regard this as an exceedingly <unk> marriage .
Am I here , sir ?
Yes , I thank you ; I am here , Mr. C. , and enjoying the pleasure of some agreeable conversation with Miss Summerson , for which I have to thank you very much , sir ! ” He broke off thus in answer to Richard , who addressed him as he came into the room .
By this time I too well understood Mr. Vholes ’ s <unk> way of <unk> himself and his respectability not to feel that our worst fears did but keep pace with his client ’ s progress .
We sat down to dinner , and I had an opportunity of observing Richard , anxiously .
I was not disturbed by Mr. Vholes ( who took off his gloves to dine ) , though he sat opposite to me at the small table , for I doubt if , looking up at all , he once removed his eyes from his host ’ s face .
I found Richard thin and languid , <unk> in his dress , <unk> in his manner , <unk> his spirits now and then , and at other intervals relapsing into a dull <unk> .
About his large bright eyes that used to be so merry there was a <unk> and a <unk> that changed them altogether .
I cannot use the expression that he looked old .
There is a ruin of youth which is not like age , and into such a ruin Richard ’ s youth and youthful beauty had all fallen away .
He <unk> little and seemed indifferent what it was , showed himself to be much more impatient than he used to be , and was quick even with Ada .
I thought at first that his old light-hearted manner was all gone , but it shone out of him sometimes as I had occasionally known little <unk> <unk> of my own old face to look out upon me from the glass .
His laugh had not quite left him either , but it was like the echo of a joyful sound , and that is always sorrowful .
Yet he was as glad as ever , in his old affectionate way , to have me there , and we talked of the old times pleasantly .
These did not appear to be interesting to Mr. Vholes , though he occasionally made a gasp which I believe was his smile .
He rose shortly after dinner and said that with the permission of the ladies he would retire to his office .
“ Always devoted to business , Vholes ! ” cried Richard .
“ Yes , Mr. C. , ” he returned , “ the interests of clients are never to be neglected , sir .
They are <unk> in the thoughts of a professional man like myself , who wishes to preserve a good name among his <unk> and society at large .
My <unk> myself the pleasure of the present agreeable conversation may not be wholly <unk> of your own interests , Mr. C. ” Richard expressed himself quite sure of that and lighted Mr. Vholes out .
On his return he told us , more than once , that Vholes was a good fellow , a safe fellow , a man who did what he pretended to do , a very good fellow indeed !
He was so <unk> about it that it struck me he had begun to doubt Mr. Vholes .
Then he threw himself on the sofa , tired out ; and Ada and I put things to rights , for they had no other servant than the woman who attended to the chambers .
My dear girl had a cottage piano there and quietly sat down to sing some of Richard ’ s <unk> , the lamp being first removed into the next room , as he complained of its hurting his eyes .
I sat between them , at my dear girl ’ s side , and felt very melancholy listening to her sweet voice .
I think Richard did too ; I think he darkened the room for that reason .
She had been singing some time , rising between <unk> to <unk> over him and speak to him , when Mr. Woodcourt came in .
Then he sat down by Richard and half <unk> , half earnestly , quite naturally and easily , found out how he felt and where he had been all day .
Presently he proposed to accompany him in a short walk on one of the bridges , as it was a moonlight airy night ; and Richard readily <unk> , they went out together .
They left my dear girl still sitting at the piano and me still sitting beside her .
When they were gone out , I drew my arm round her waist .
She put her left hand in mine ( I was sitting on that side ) , but kept her right upon the keys , going over and over them without striking any note .
“ Esther , my dearest , ” she said , breaking silence , “ Richard is never so well and I am never so easy about him as when he is with Allan Woodcourt .
We have to thank you for that . ” I pointed out to my darling how this could scarcely be , because Mr. Woodcourt had come to her cousin John ’ s house and had known us all there , and because he had always liked Richard , and Richard had always liked him , and — and so forth .
“ All true , ” said Ada , “ but that he is such a devoted friend to us we owe to you . ” I thought it best to let my dear girl have her way and to say no more about it .
So I said as much .
I said it lightly , because I felt her trembling .
“ Esther , my dearest , I want to be a good wife , a very , very good wife indeed .
You shall teach me . ” I teach !
I said no more , for I noticed the hand that was fluttering over the keys , and I knew that it was not I who ought to speak , that it was she who had something to say to me .
“ When I married Richard I was not insensible to what was before him .
I had been perfectly happy for a long time with you , and I had never known any trouble or anxiety , so loved and cared for , but I understood the danger he was in , dear Esther . ” “ I know , I know , my darling . ” “ When we were married I had some little hope that I might be able to <unk> him of his mistake , that he might come to regard it in a new way as my husband and not pursue it all the more <unk> for my sake — as he does .
But if I had not had that hope , I would have married him just the same , Esther .
Just the same ! ” In the <unk> <unk> of the hand that was never still — a <unk> inspired by the utterance of these last words , and dying away with them — I saw the confirmation of her earnest tones .
“ You are not to think , my dearest Esther , that I fail to see what you see and fear what you fear .
No one can understand him better than I do .
The greatest wisdom that ever lived in the world could scarcely know Richard better than my love does . ” She spoke so modestly and softly and her trembling hand expressed such agitation as it moved to and fro upon the silent notes !
My dear , dear girl !
“ I see him at his worst every day .
I watch him in his sleep .
I know every change of his face .
But when I married Richard I was quite determined , Esther , if heaven would help me , never to show him that I grieved for what he did and so to make him more unhappy .
I want him , when he comes home , to find no trouble in my face .
I want him , when he looks at me , to see what he loved in me .
I married him to do this , and this <unk> me . ” I felt her trembling more .
I waited for what was yet to come , and I now thought I began to know what it was .
“ And something else <unk> me , Esther . ” She stopped a minute .
<unk> speaking only ; her hand was still in motion .
“ I look forward a little while , and I don ’ t know what great aid may come to me .
When Richard turns his eyes upon me then , there may be something lying on my breast more eloquent than I have been , with greater power than mine to show him his true course and win him back . ” Her hand stopped now .
She clasped me in her arms , and I clasped her in mine .
“ If that little creature should fail too , Esther , I still look forward .
I look forward a long while , through years and years , and think that then , when I am growing old , or when I am dead perhaps , a beautiful woman , his daughter , happily married , may be proud of him and a blessing to him .
Or that a generous brave man , as handsome as he used to be , as hopeful , and far more happy , may walk in the sunshine with him , honouring his grey head and saying to himself , ‘ I thank God this is my father !
<unk> by a fatal inheritance , and restored through me ! ’ ” Oh , my sweet girl , what a heart was that which beat so fast against me !
“ These hopes <unk> me , my dear Esther , and I know they will .
Though sometimes even they depart from me before a dread that arises when I look at Richard . ” I tried to cheer my darling , and asked her what it was .
<unk> and weeping , she replied , “ That he may not live to see his child . ” CHAPTER <unk> A Discovery The days when I <unk> that miserable corner which my dear girl brightened can never <unk> in my remembrance .
I never see it , and I never wish to see it now ; I have been there only once since , but in my memory there is a <unk> glory shining on the place which will shine for ever .
Not a day passed without my going there , of course .
At first I found Mr. Skimpole there , on two or three occasions , <unk> playing the piano and talking in his usual vivacious <unk> .
Now , besides my very much <unk> the probability of his being there without making Richard poorer , I felt as if there were something in his careless gaiety too <unk> with what I knew of the <unk> of Ada ’ s life .
I clearly perceived , too , that Ada <unk> my feelings .
I therefore resolved , after much thinking of it , to make a private visit to Mr. Skimpole and try delicately to explain myself .
My dear girl was the great consideration that made me bold .
I set off one morning , accompanied by Charley , for <unk> <unk> .
As I approached the house , I was strongly inclined to turn back , for I felt what a desperate attempt it was to make an impression on Mr. Skimpole and how extremely likely it was that he would <unk> <unk> me .
However , I thought that being there , I would go through with it .
I knocked with a trembling hand at Mr. Skimpole ’ s door — <unk> with a hand , for the <unk> was gone — and after a long <unk> gained admission from an <unk> , who was in the area when I knocked , breaking up the <unk> of a <unk> with a <unk> to light the fire with .
Mr. Skimpole , lying on the sofa in his room , playing the <unk> a little , was enchanted to see me .
Now , who should receive me , he asked .
Who would I prefer for mistress of the <unk> ?
Would I have his Comedy daughter , his Beauty daughter , or his Sentiment daughter ?
Or would I have all the daughters at once in a perfect nosegay ?
I replied , half <unk> already , that I wished to speak to himself only if he would give me leave .
“ My dear Miss Summerson , most <unk> !
Of course , ” he said , bringing his chair nearer mine and breaking into his fascinating smile , “ of course it ’ s not business .
Then it ’ s pleasure ! ” I said it certainly was not business that I came upon , but it was not quite a pleasant matter .
“ Then , my dear Miss Summerson , ” said he with the <unk> gaiety , “ don ’ t allude to it .
Why should you allude to anything that is NOT a pleasant matter ?
I never do .
And you are a much pleasanter creature , in every point of view , than I.
You are perfectly pleasant ; I am imperfectly pleasant ; then , if I never allude to an unpleasant matter , how much less should you !
So that ’ s disposed of , and we will talk of something else . ” Although I was embarrassed , I took courage to <unk> that I still wished to pursue the subject .
“ I should think it a mistake , ” said Mr. Skimpole with his airy laugh , “ if I thought Miss Summerson capable of making one .
But I don ’ t ! ” “ Mr.
Skimpole , ” said I , raising my eyes to his , “ I have so often heard you say that you are <unk> with the common affairs of life — ” “ <unk> our three <unk> friends , <unk> , S , and who ’ s the <unk> partner ?
D ? ” said Mr. Skimpole , brightly .
“ Not an idea of them ! ” “ — That perhaps , ” I went on , “ you will excuse my <unk> on that account .
I think you ought most seriously to know that Richard is poorer than he was . ” “ Dear me ! ” said Mr. Skimpole .
“ So am I , they tell me . ” “ And in very embarrassed circumstances . ” “ <unk> case , exactly ! ” said Mr. Skimpole with a delighted countenance .
“ This at present naturally causes Ada much secret anxiety , and as I think she is less anxious when no claims are made upon her by visitors , and as Richard has one uneasiness always heavy on his mind , it has occurred to me to take the liberty of saying that — if you would — not — ” I was coming to the point with great difficulty when he took me by both hands and with a radiant face and in the <unk> way anticipated it .
“ Not go there ?
Certainly not , my dear Miss Summerson , most assuredly not .
Why <unk> I go there ?
When I go anywhere , I go for pleasure .
I don ’ t go anywhere for pain , because I was made for pleasure .
<unk> comes to ME when it wants me .
Now , I have had very little pleasure at our dear Richard ’ s lately , and your practical <unk> <unk> why .
Our young friends , losing the youthful poetry which was once so captivating in them , begin to think , ‘ This is a man who wants pounds . ’ So I am ; I always want pounds ; not for myself , but because <unk> always want them of me .
Next , our young friends begin to think , becoming <unk> , ‘ This is the man who HAD pounds , who borrowed them , ’ which I did .
I always borrow pounds .
So our young friends , <unk> to prose ( which is much to be regretted ) , <unk> in their power of <unk> pleasure to me .
Why should I go to see them , therefore ?
<unk> ! ” Through the <unk> smile with which he regarded me as he <unk> thus , there now broke forth a look of disinterested benevolence quite astonishing .
“ Besides , ” he said , pursuing his argument in his tone of light-hearted conviction , “ if I don ’ t go anywhere for pain — which would be a <unk> of the intention of my being , and a monstrous thing to do — why should I go anywhere to be the cause of pain ?
If I went to see our young friends in their present <unk> state of mind , I should give them pain .
The <unk> with me would be disagreeable .
They might say , ‘ This is the man who had pounds and who can ’ t pay pounds , ’ which I can ’ t , of course ; nothing could be more out of the question !
Then kindness requires that I shouldn ’ t go near them — and I won ’ t . ” He finished by <unk> kissing my hand and thanking me .
Nothing but Miss Summerson ’ s fine tact , he said , would have found this out for him .
I was much disconcerted , but I reflected that if the main point were gained , it <unk> little how strangely he <unk> everything leading to it .
I had determined to mention something else , however , and I thought I was not to be put off in that .
“ Mr.
Skimpole , ” said I , “ I must take the liberty of saying before I conclude my visit that I was much surprised to learn , on the best authority , some little time ago , that you knew with whom that poor boy left Bleak House and that you accepted a present on that occasion .
I have not mentioned it to my guardian , for I fear it would hurt him <unk> ; but I may say to you that I was much surprised . ” “ No ?
Really surprised , my dear Miss Summerson ? ” he returned inquiringly , raising his pleasant eyebrows .
“ <unk> surprised . ” He thought about it for a little while with a highly agreeable and <unk> expression of face , then quite gave it up and said in his most engaging manner , “ You know what a child I am .
Why surprised ? ” I was <unk> to enter <unk> into that question , but as he begged I would , for he was really curious to know , I gave him to understand in the <unk> words I could use that his conduct seemed to involve a <unk> of several moral obligations .
He was much amused and interested when he heard this and said , “ No , really ? ” with ingenuous simplicity .
“ You know I don ’ t intend to be responsible .
I never could do it .
<unk> is a thing that has always been above me — or below me , ” said Mr. Skimpole .
“ I don ’ t even know which ; but as I understand the way in which my dear Miss Summerson ( always remarkable for her practical good sense and <unk> ) puts this case , I should imagine it was chiefly a question of money , do you know ? ” I <unk> gave a <unk> assent to this .
“ Ah !
Then you see , ” said Mr. Skimpole , shaking his head , “ I am hopeless of understanding it . ” I suggested , as I rose to go , that it was not right to <unk> my guardian ’ s confidence for a <unk> .
“ My dear Miss Summerson , ” he returned with a candid <unk> that was all his own , “ I can ’ t be <unk> . ” “ Not by Mr. Bucket ? ” said I.
“ No , ” said he .
“ Not by anybody .
I don ’ t <unk> any value to money .
I don ’ t care about it , I don ’ t know about it , I don ’ t want it , I don ’ t keep it — it goes away from me directly .
How can I be <unk> ? ” I showed that I was of a different opinion , though I had not the capacity for arguing the question .
“ On the contrary , ” said Mr. Skimpole , “ I am exactly the man to be placed in a superior position in such a case as that .
I am above the rest of mankind in such a case as that .
I can act with philosophy in such a case as that .
I am not <unk> by <unk> , as an Italian baby is by <unk> .
I am as free as the air .
I feel myself as far above suspicion as <unk> ’ s wife . ” Anything to equal the <unk> of his manner and the playful <unk> with which he seemed to <unk> himself , as he <unk> the matter about like a ball of feathers , was surely never seen in anybody else !
“ <unk> the case , my dear Miss Summerson .
Here is a boy received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to .
The boy being in bed , a man arrives — like the house that <unk> built .
Here is the man who demands the boy who is received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to .
Here is a <unk> produced by the man who demands the boy who is received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to .
Here is the Skimpole who <unk> the <unk> produced by the man who demands the boy who is received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to .
Those are the facts .
Very well .
<unk> the Skimpole have refused the note ?
<unk> should the Skimpole have refused the note ?
Skimpole <unk> to Bucket , ‘ What ’ s this for ?
I don ’ t understand it , it is of no use to me , take it away . ’ Bucket still <unk> Skimpole to accept it .
Are there reasons why Skimpole , not being <unk> by <unk> , should accept it ?
Yes .
Skimpole perceives them .
What are they ?
Skimpole reasons with himself , this is a <unk> <unk> , an active <unk> , an intelligent man , a person of a <unk> directed energy and great <unk> both of <unk> and <unk> , who <unk> our friends and enemies for us when they run away , recovers our property for us when we are robbed , <unk> us comfortably when we are murdered .
This active <unk> and intelligent man has acquired , in the exercise of his art , a strong faith in money ; he finds it very useful to him , and he makes it very useful to society .
Shall I shake that faith in Bucket because I want it myself ; shall I deliberately <unk> one of Bucket ’ s weapons ; shall I positively <unk> Bucket in his next <unk> <unk> ?
And again .
If it is <unk> in Skimpole to take the note , it is <unk> in Bucket to offer the note — much more <unk> in Bucket , because he is the knowing man .
Now , Skimpole wishes to think well of Bucket ; Skimpole <unk> it essential , in its little place , to the general <unk> of things , that he <unk> think well of Bucket .
The state expressly asks him to trust to Bucket .
And he does .
And that ’ s all he does ! ” I had nothing to offer in reply to this <unk> and therefore took my leave .
Mr. Skimpole , however , who was in excellent spirits , would not hear of my returning home attended only by “ Little Coavinses , ” and accompanied me himself .
He entertained me on the way with a variety of delightful conversation and assured me , at parting , that he should never forget the fine tact with which I had found that out for him about our young friends .
As it so happened that I never saw Mr. Skimpole again , I may at once finish what I know of his history .
A coolness arose between him and my guardian , <unk> principally on the <unk> grounds and on his having <unk> <unk> my guardian ’ s entreaties ( as we afterwards learned from Ada ) in reference to Richard .
His being heavily in my guardian ’ s debt had nothing to do with their separation .
He died some five years afterwards and left a <unk> behind him , with letters and other <unk> towards his life , which was published and which showed him to have been the victim of a <unk> on the part of mankind against an amiable child .
It was considered very pleasant reading , but I never read more of it myself than the sentence on which I <unk> to light on opening the book .
It was this : “ Jarndyce , in common with most other men I have known , is the <unk> of <unk> . ” And now I come to a part of my story touching myself very nearly indeed , and for which I was quite unprepared when the circumstance occurred .
Whatever little <unk> may have now and then revived in my mind associated with my poor old face had only revived as belonging to a part of my life that was gone — gone like my <unk> or my childhood .
I have suppressed none of my many weaknesses on that subject , but have written them as faithfully as my memory has recalled them .
And I hope to do , and mean to do , the same down to the last words of these pages , which I see now not so very far before me .
The months were gliding away , and my dear girl , <unk> by the hopes she had confided in me , was the same beautiful star in the miserable corner .
Richard , more worn and haggard , <unk> the court day after day , <unk> sat there the whole day long when he knew there was no remote chance of the suit being mentioned , and became one of the stock <unk> of the place .
I wonder whether any of the gentlemen remembered him as he was when he first went there .
So completely was he absorbed in his fixed idea that he used to <unk> in his cheerful moments that he should never have breathed the fresh air now “ but for Woodcourt . ” It was only Mr. Woodcourt who could occasionally <unk> his attention for a few hours at a time and <unk> him , even when he sunk into a <unk> of mind and body that alarmed us greatly , and the returns of which became more frequent as the months went on .
My dear girl was right in saying that he only pursued his errors the more <unk> for her sake .
I have no doubt that his desire to <unk> what he had lost was rendered the more intense by his grief for his young wife , and became like the <unk> of a <unk> .
I was there , as I have mentioned , at all hours .
When I was there at night , I generally went home with Charley in a coach ; sometimes my guardian would meet me in the neighbourhood , and we would walk home together .
One evening he had arranged to meet me at eight o ’ clock .
I could not leave , as I usually did , quite <unk> at the time , for I was working for my dear girl and had a few <unk> more to do to finish what I was about ; but it was within a few minutes of the hour when I <unk> up my little <unk> , gave my darling my last kiss for the night , and hurried downstairs .
Mr. Woodcourt went with me , as it was dusk .
When we came to the usual place of meeting — it was close by , and Mr. Woodcourt had often accompanied me before — my guardian was not there .
We waited half an hour , walking up and down , but there were no signs of him .
We agreed that he was either prevented from coming or that he had come and gone away , and Mr. Woodcourt proposed to walk home with me .
It was the first walk we had ever taken together , except that very short one to the usual place of meeting .
We spoke of Richard and Ada the whole way .
I did not thank him in words for what he had done — my appreciation of it had risen above all words then — but I hoped he might not be without some understanding of what I felt so strongly .
<unk> at home and going upstairs , we found that my guardian was out and that Mrs. Woodcourt was out too .
We were in the very same room into which I had brought my blushing girl when her youthful lover , now her so altered husband , was the choice of her young heart , the very same room from which my guardian and I had watched them going away through the sunlight in the fresh bloom of their hope and promise .
We were standing by the opened window looking down into the street when Mr. Woodcourt spoke to me .
I learned in a moment that he loved me .
I learned in a moment that my <unk> face was all <unk> to him .
I learned in a moment that what I had thought was pity and compassion was devoted , generous , faithful love .
Oh , too late to know it now , too late , too late .
That was the first ungrateful thought I had .
<unk> late .
“ When I returned , ” he told me , “ when I came back , no richer than when I went away , and found you newly risen from a sick bed , yet so inspired by sweet consideration for others and so free from a selfish thought — ” “ Oh , Mr. Woodcourt , <unk> , <unk> ! ” I entreated him .
“ I do not <unk> your high praise .
I had many selfish thoughts at that time , many ! ” “ Heaven knows , beloved of my life , ” said he , “ that my praise is not a lover ’ s praise , but the truth .
You do not know what all around you see in Esther Summerson , how many hearts she touches and <unk> , what sacred admiration and what love she <unk> . ” “ Oh , Mr. Woodcourt , ” cried I , “ it is a great thing to win love , it is a great thing to win love !
I am proud of it , and honoured by it ; and the hearing of it causes me to shed these tears of mingled joy and sorrow — joy that I have won it , sorrow that I have not <unk> it better ; but I am not free to think of yours . ” I said it with a stronger heart , for when he praised me thus and when I heard his voice <unk> with his belief that what he said was true , I aspired to be more worthy of it .
It was not too late for that .
Although I closed this <unk> page in my life to-night , I could be <unk> of it all through my life .
And it was a comfort to me , and an impulse to me , and I felt a dignity rise up within me that was derived from him when I thought so .
He broke the silence .
“ I should poorly show the trust that I have in the dear one who will evermore be as dear to me as now ” — and the deep earnestness with which he said it at once strengthened me and made me <unk> — “ if , after her assurance that she is not free to think of my love , I urged it .
Dear Esther , let me only tell you that the fond idea of you which I took abroad was <unk> to the <unk> when I came home .
I have always hoped , in the first hour when I seemed to stand in any ray of good fortune , to tell you this .
I have always feared that I should tell it you in vain .
My hopes and fears are both <unk> to-night .
I distress you .
I have said enough . ” Something seemed to pass into my place that was like the angel he thought me , and I felt so sorrowful for the loss he had <unk> !
I wished to help him in his trouble , as I had wished to do when he showed that first <unk> for me .
“ Dear Mr. Woodcourt , ” said I , “ before we part to-night , something is left for me to say .
I never could say it as I wish — I never shall — but — ” I had to think again of being more <unk> of his love and his affliction before I could go on .
“ — I am deeply sensible of your generosity , and I shall <unk> its remembrance to my dying hour .
I know full well how changed I am , I know you are not <unk> with my history , and I know what a noble love that is which is so faithful .
What you have said to me could have affected me so much from no other lips , for there are none that could give it such a value to me .
It shall not be lost .
It shall make me better . ” He covered his eyes with his hand and turned away his head .
How could I ever be worthy of those tears ?
“ If , in the <unk> <unk> we shall have together — in <unk> Richard and Ada , and I hope in many happier <unk> of life — you ever find anything in me which you can <unk> think is better than it used to be , believe that it will have <unk> up from to-night and that I shall owe it to you .
And never believe , dear dear Mr. Woodcourt , never believe that I forget this night or that while my heart beats it can be insensible to the pride and joy of having been beloved by you . ” He took my hand and kissed it .
He was like himself again , and I felt still more encouraged .
“ I am induced by what you said just now , ” said I , “ to hope that you have succeeded in your endeavour . ” “ I have , ” he answered .
“ With such help from Mr. Jarndyce as you who know him so well can imagine him to have rendered me , I have succeeded . ” “ Heaven bless him for it , ” said I , giving him my hand ; “ and heaven bless you in all you do ! ” “ I shall do it better for the wish , ” he answered ; “ it will make me enter on these new duties as on another sacred trust from you . ” “ Ah !
Richard ! ” I exclaimed <unk> , “ What will he do when you are gone ! ” “ I am not required to go yet ; I would not desert him , dear Miss Summerson , even if I were . ” One other thing I felt it <unk> to touch upon before he left me .
I knew that I should not be <unk> of the love I could not take if I reserved it .
“ Mr.
Woodcourt , ” said I , “ you will be glad to know from my lips before I say good night that in the future , which is clear and bright before me , I am most happy , most fortunate , have nothing to regret or desire . ” It was indeed a glad hearing to him , he replied .
“ From my childhood I have been , ” said I , “ the object of the <unk> goodness of the best of human <unk> , to whom I am so bound by every tie of attachment , gratitude , and love , that nothing I could do in the <unk> of a life could express the feelings of a single day . ” “ I share those feelings , ” he returned .
“ You speak of Mr. Jarndyce . ” “ You know his virtues well , ” said I , “ but few can know the greatness of his character as I know it .
All its highest and best qualities have been revealed to me in nothing more brightly than in the <unk> out of that future in which I am so happy .
And if your highest homage and respect had not been his already — which I know they are — they would have been his , I think , on this assurance and in the feeling it would have awakened in you towards him for my sake . ” He <unk> replied that indeed indeed they would have been .
I gave him my hand again .
“ Good night , ” I said , “ Good-bye . ” “ The first until we meet to-morrow , the second as a farewell to this theme between us for ever . ” “ Yes . ” “ Good night ; good-bye . ” He left me , and I stood at the dark window watching the street .
His love , in all its constancy and generosity , had come so suddenly upon me that he had not left me a minute when my <unk> gave way again and the street was blotted out by my rushing tears .
But they were not tears of regret and sorrow .
No .
He had called me the beloved of his life and had said I would be evermore as dear to him as I was then , and I felt as if my heart would not hold the triumph of having heard those words .
My first wild thought had died away .
It was not too late to hear them , for it was not too late to be animated by them to be good , true , grateful , and contented .
How easy my path , how much easier than his !
CHAPTER <unk> Another Discovery I had not the courage to see any one that night .
I had not even the courage to see myself , for I was afraid that my tears might a little reproach me .
I went up to my room in the dark , and prayed in the dark , and lay down in the dark to sleep .
I had no need of any light to read my guardian ’ s letter by , for I knew it by heart .
I took it from the place where I kept it , and repeated its contents by its own clear light of <unk> and love , and went to sleep with it on my pillow .
I was up very early in the morning and called Charley to come for a walk .
We bought flowers for the <unk> , and came back and arranged them , and were as busy as possible .
We were so early that I had a good time still for Charley ’ s lesson before breakfast ; Charley ( who was not in the least improved in the old defective article of <unk> ) came through it with great <unk> ; and we were altogether very <unk> .
When my guardian appeared he said , “ Why , little woman , you look <unk> than your flowers ! ” And Mrs. Woodcourt repeated and <unk> a passage from the <unk> expressive of my being like a <unk> with the sun upon it .
This was all so pleasant that I hope it made me still more like the <unk> than I had been before .
After breakfast I waited my opportunity and <unk> about a little until I saw my guardian in his own room — the room of last night — by himself .
Then I made an excuse to go in with my housekeeping keys , shutting the door after me .
“ Well , Dame Durden ? ” said my guardian ; the post had brought him several letters , and he was writing .
“ You want money ? ” “ No , indeed , I have plenty in hand . ” “ There never was such a Dame Durden , ” said my guardian , “ for making money last . ” He had laid down his pen and leaned back in his chair looking at me .
I have often spoken of his bright face , but I thought I had never seen it look so bright and good .
There was a high happiness upon it which made me think , “ He has been doing some great kindness this morning . ” “ There never was , ” said my guardian , musing as he smiled upon me , “ such a Dame Durden for making money last . ” He had never yet altered his old manner .
I loved it and him so much that when I now went up to him and took my usual chair , which was always put at his side — for sometimes I read to him , and sometimes I talked to him , and sometimes I silently worked by him — I hardly liked to disturb it by laying my hand on his breast .
But I found I did not disturb it at all .
“ Dear guardian , ” said I , “ I want to speak to you .
Have I been <unk> in anything ? ” “ <unk> in anything , my dear ! ” “ Have I not been what I have meant to be since — I brought the answer to your letter , guardian ? ” “ You have been everything I could desire , my love . ” “ I am very glad indeed to hear that , ” I returned .
“ You know , you said to me , was this the mistress of Bleak House .
And I said , yes . ” “ Yes , ” said my guardian , nodding his head .
He had put his arm about me as if there were something to protect me from and looked in my face , smiling .
“ Since then , ” said I , “ we have never spoken on the subject except once . ” “ And then I said Bleak House was <unk> fast ; and so it was , my dear . ” “ And I said , ” I timidly reminded him , “ but its mistress remained . ” He still held me in the same <unk> manner and with the same bright goodness in his face .
“ Dear guardian , ” said I , “ I know how you have felt all that has happened , and how considerate you have been .
As so much time has passed , and as you spoke only this morning of my being so well again , perhaps you expect me to renew the subject .
Perhaps I ought to do so .
I will be the mistress of Bleak House when you please . ” “ See , ” he returned gaily , “ what a sympathy there must be between us !
I have had nothing else , poor Rick <unk> — it ’ s a large <unk> — in my mind .
When you came in , I was full of it .
When shall we give Bleak House its mistress , little woman ? ” “ When you please . ” “ Next month ? ” “ Next month , dear guardian . ” “ The day on which I take the happiest and best step of my life — the day on which I shall be a man more <unk> and more <unk> than any other man in the world — the day on which I give Bleak House its little mistress — shall be next month then , ” said my guardian .
I put my arms round his neck and kissed him just as I had done on the day when I brought my answer .
A servant came to the door to <unk> Mr. Bucket , which was quite unnecessary , for Mr. Bucket was already looking in over the servant ’ s shoulder .
“ Mr.
Jarndyce and Miss Summerson , ” said he , rather out of breath , “ with all <unk> for <unk> , WILL you allow me to order up a person that ’ s on the stairs and that objects to being left there in case of becoming the subject of observations in his absence ?
Thank you .
Be so good as chair that there member in this direction , will you ? ” said Mr. Bucket , <unk> over the <unk> .
This singular request produced an old man in a black skull-cap , unable to walk , who was carried up by a couple of bearers and deposited in the room near the door .
Mr. Bucket immediately got rid of the bearers , mysteriously shut the door , and <unk> it .
“ Now you see , Mr. Jarndyce , ” he then began , putting down his hat and opening his subject with a <unk> of his <unk> finger , “ you know me , and Miss Summerson knows me .
This gentleman likewise knows me , and his name is Smallweed .
The <unk> line is his line principally , and he ’ s what you may call a <unk> in bills .
That ’ s about what YOU are , you know , ain ’ t you ? ” said Mr. Bucket , stopping a little to address the gentleman in question , who was exceedingly suspicious of him .
He seemed about to dispute this <unk> of himself when he was seized with a violent fit of coughing .
“ Now , moral , you know ! ” said Mr. Bucket , improving the accident .
“ Don ’ t you <unk> when there ain ’ t no occasion , and you won ’ t be took in that way .
Now , Mr. Jarndyce , I address myself to you .
I ’ ve been <unk> with this gentleman on behalf of Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and one way and another I ’ ve been in and out and about his premises a deal .
His premises are the premises formerly occupied by Krook , <unk> <unk> <unk> — a relation of this gentleman ’ s that you saw in his lifetime if I don ’ t mistake ? ” My guardian replied , “ Yes . ” “ Well !
You are to understand , ” said Mr. Bucket , “ that this gentleman he come into Krook ’ s property , and a good deal of <unk> property there was .
<unk> <unk> of waste-paper among the rest .
Lord bless you , of no use to nobody ! ” The <unk> of Mr. Bucket ’ s eye and the masterly manner in which he <unk> , without a look or a word against which his watchful <unk> could protest , to let us know that he stated the case according to previous agreement and could say much more of Mr. Smallweed if he thought it <unk> , <unk> us of any merit in quite understanding him .
His difficulty was increased by Mr. Smallweed ’ s being deaf as well as suspicious and watching his face with the <unk> attention .
“ Among them odd heaps of old papers , this gentleman , when he comes into the property , naturally begins to <unk> , don ’ t you see ? ” said Mr. Bucket .
“ To which ?
Say that again , ” cried Mr. Smallweed in a shrill , sharp voice .
“ To <unk> , ” repeated Mr. Bucket .
“ Being a prudent man and accustomed to take care of your own affairs , you begin to <unk> among the papers as you have come into ; don ’ t you ? ” “ Of course I do , ” cried Mr. Smallweed .
“ Of course you do , ” said Mr. Bucket <unk> , “ and much to blame you would be if you didn ’ t .
And so you chance to find , you know , ” Mr. Bucket went on , stooping over him with an air of cheerful <unk> which Mr. Smallweed by no means <unk> , “ and so you chance to find , you know , a paper with the <unk> of Jarndyce to it .
Don ’ t you ? ” Mr. Smallweed glanced with a troubled eye at us and <unk> nodded assent .
“ And coming to look at that paper at your full leisure and <unk> — all in good time , for you ’ re not curious to read it , and why should you be ? — what do you find it to be but a will , you see .
That ’ s the <unk> of it , ” said Mr. Bucket with the same lively air of <unk> a joke for the enjoyment of Mr. Smallweed , who still had the same <unk> appearance of not enjoying it at all ; “ what do you find it to be but a will ? ” “ I don ’ t know that it ’ s good as a will or as anything else , ” <unk> Mr. Smallweed .
Mr. Bucket eyed the old man for a moment — he had slipped and <unk> down in his chair into a mere bundle — as if he were much disposed to <unk> upon him ; <unk> , he continued to <unk> over him with the same agreeable air , keeping the corner of one of his eyes upon us .
“ <unk> which , ” said Mr. Bucket , “ you get a little doubtful and uncomfortable in your mind about it , having a very tender mind of your own . ” “ Eh ?
What do you say I have got of my own ? ” asked Mr. Smallweed with his hand to his ear .
“ A very tender mind . ” “ Ho !
Well , go on , ” said Mr. Smallweed .
“ And as you ’ ve heard a good deal mentioned regarding a celebrated Chancery will case of the same name , and as you know what a card Krook was for buying all manner of old pieces of <unk> , and books , and papers , and what not , and never liking to part with ’ em , and always a-going to teach himself to read , you begin to think — and you never was more correct in your born days — ‘ <unk> , if I don ’ t look about me , I may get into trouble regarding this will . ’ ” “ Now , mind how you put it , Bucket , ” cried the old man anxiously with his hand at his ear .
“ Speak up ; none of your brimstone <unk> .
<unk> me up ; I want to hear better .
Oh , Lord , I am shaken to bits ! ” Mr. Bucket had certainly picked him up at a <unk> .
However , as soon as he could be heard through Mr. Smallweed ’ s coughing and his <unk> <unk> of “ Oh , my bones !
Oh , dear !
I ’ ve no breath in my body !
I ’ m worse than the chattering , <unk> , brimstone pig at home ! ” Mr. Bucket proceeded in the same <unk> manner as before .
“ So , as I happen to be in the habit of coming about your premises , you take me into your confidence , don ’ t you ? ” I think it would be impossible to make an admission with more ill will and a worse grace than Mr. Smallweed <unk> when he admitted this , rendering it perfectly evident that Mr. Bucket was the very last person he would have thought of taking into his confidence if he could by any possibility have kept him out of it .
“ And I go into the business with you — very pleasant we are over it ; and I confirm you in your <unk> fears that you will get yourself into a most precious line if you don ’ t come out with that there will , ” said Mr. Bucket <unk> ; “ and accordingly you arrange with me that it shall be delivered up to this present Mr. Jarndyce , on no conditions .
If it should prove to be <unk> , you trusting yourself to him for your reward ; that ’ s about where it is , ain ’ t it ? ” “ That ’ s what was agreed , ” Mr. Smallweed assented with the same bad grace .
“ In consequence of which , ” said Mr. Bucket , <unk> his agreeable manner all at once and becoming strictly business-like , “ you ’ ve got that will upon your person at the present time , and the only thing that remains for you to do is just to out with it ! ” Having given us one glance out of the watching corner of his eye , and having given his nose one triumphant rub with his forefinger , Mr. Bucket stood with his eyes fastened on his confidential friend and his hand stretched forth ready to take the paper and present it to my guardian .
It was not produced without much <unk> and many <unk> on the part of Mr. Smallweed that he was a poor industrious man and that he left it to Mr. Jarndyce ’ s honour not to let him lose by his <unk> .
Little by little he very slowly took from a <unk> a stained , discoloured paper which was much <unk> upon the outside and a little burnt at the <unk> , as if it had long ago been thrown upon a fire and hastily <unk> off again .
Mr. Bucket lost no time in <unk> this paper , with the <unk> of a <unk> , from Mr. Smallweed to Mr. Jarndyce .
As he gave it to my guardian , he whispered behind his fingers , “ Hadn ’ t settled how to make their <unk> of it .
<unk> and hinted about it .
I laid out twenty pound upon it .
First the <unk> <unk> <unk> upon him on account of their objections to his living so <unk> long , and then they <unk> on one another .
Lord !
There ain ’ t one of the family that wouldn ’ t sell the other for a pound or two , except the old lady — and she ’ s only out of it because she ’ s too weak in her mind to drive a bargain . ” “ Mr Bucket , ” said my guardian aloud , “ whatever the worth of this paper may be to any one , my obligations are great to you ; and if it be of any worth , I hold myself bound to see Mr. Smallweed <unk> accordingly . ” “ Not according to your merits , you know , ” said Mr. Bucket in friendly explanation to Mr. Smallweed .
“ Don ’ t you be afraid of that .
<unk> to its value . ” “ That is what I mean , ” said my guardian .
“ You may observe , Mr. Bucket , that I <unk> from examining this paper myself .
The plain truth is , I have <unk> and <unk> the whole business these many years , and my soul is sick of it .
But Miss Summerson and I will immediately place the paper in the hands of my solicitor in the cause , and its existence shall be made known without delay to all other parties interested . ” “ Mr.
Jarndyce can ’ t say <unk> than that , you understand , ” observed Mr. Bucket to his <unk> .
“ And it being now made clear to you that nobody ’ s a-going to be <unk> — which must be a great relief to YOUR mind — we may proceed with the ceremony of <unk> you home again . ” He <unk> the door , called in the bearers , wished us good morning , and with a look full of meaning and a crook of his finger at parting went his way .
We went our way too , which was to Lincoln ’ s Inn , as quickly as possible .
Mr. Kenge was <unk> , and we found him at his table in his dusty room with the <unk> books and the piles of papers .
<unk> having been placed for us by Mr. Guppy , Mr. Kenge expressed the surprise and gratification he felt at the unusual sight of Mr. Jarndyce in his office .
He turned over his double eye-glass as he spoke and was more Conversation Kenge than ever .
“ I hope , ” said Mr. Kenge , “ that the genial influence of Miss Summerson , ” he bowed to me , “ may have induced Mr. Jarndyce , ” he bowed to him , “ to <unk> some little of his <unk> towards a cause and towards a court which are — shall I say , which take their place in the stately <unk> of the <unk> of our profession ? ” “ I am inclined to think , ” returned my guardian , “ that Miss Summerson has seen too much of the effects of the court and the cause to <unk> any influence in their favour .
Nevertheless , they are a part of the occasion of my being here .
Mr. Kenge , before I lay this paper on your desk and have done with it , let me tell you how it has come into my hands . ” He did so shortly and distinctly .
“ It could not , sir , ” said Mr. Kenge , “ have been stated more plainly and to the purpose if it had been a case at law . ” “ Did you ever know English law , or equity either , plain and to the purpose ? ” said my guardian .
“ Oh , <unk> ! ” said Mr. Kenge .
At first he had not seemed to <unk> much importance to the paper , but when he saw it he appeared more interested , and when he had opened and read a little of it through his eye-glass , he became amazed .
“ Mr.
Jarndyce , ” he said , looking off it , “ you have <unk> this ? ” “ Not I ! ” returned my guardian .
“ But , my dear sir , ” said Mr. Kenge , “ it is a will of later date than any in the suit .
It appears to be all in the <unk> ’ s handwriting .
It is <unk> executed and <unk> .
And even if intended to be <unk> , as might possibly be supposed to be <unk> by these marks of fire , it is NOT <unk> .
Here it is , a perfect instrument ! ” “ Well ! ” said my guardian .
“ What is that to me ? ” “ Mr.
Guppy ! ” cried Mr. Kenge , raising his voice .
“ I beg your pardon , Mr. Jarndyce . ” “ Sir . ” “ Mr.
Vholes of Symond ’ s Inn .
My compliments .
Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
Glad to speak with him . ” Mr. Guppy disappeared .
“ You ask me what is this to you , Mr. Jarndyce .
If you had <unk> this document , you would have seen that it <unk> your interest considerably , though still leaving it a very handsome one , still leaving it a very handsome one , ” said Mr. Kenge , waving his hand <unk> and <unk> .
“ You would further have seen that the interests of Mr. Richard Carstone and of Miss Ada Clare , now Mrs. Richard Carstone , are very <unk> advanced by it . ” “ Kenge , ” said my guardian , “ if all the <unk> wealth that the suit brought into this <unk> court of Chancery could fall to my two young cousins , I should be well contented .
But do you ask ME to believe that any good is to come of Jarndyce and Jarndyce ? ” “ Oh , really , Mr. Jarndyce !
<unk> , prejudice .
My dear sir , this is a very great country , a very great country .
Its system of equity is a very great system , a very great system .
Really , really ! ” My guardian said no more , and Mr. Vholes arrived .
He was modestly impressed by Mr. Kenge ’ s professional <unk> .
“ How do you do , Mr. Vholes ?
Will you be so good as to take a chair here by me and look over this paper ? ” Mr. Vholes did as he was asked and seemed to read it every word .
He was not excited by it , but he was not excited by anything .
When he had well examined it , he retired with Mr. Kenge into a window , and shading his mouth with his black glove , spoke to him at some length .
I was not surprised to observe Mr. Kenge inclined to dispute what he said before he had said much , for I knew that no two people ever did agree about anything in Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
But he seemed to get the better of Mr. Kenge too in a conversation that sounded as if it were almost composed of the words “ <unk> , ” “ <unk> , ” “ report , ” “ estate , ” and “ costs . ” When they had finished , they came back to Mr. Kenge ’ s table and spoke aloud .
“ Well !
But this is a very remarkable document , Mr. Vholes , ” said Mr. Kenge .
Mr. Vholes said , “ Very much so . ” “ And a very important document , Mr. Vholes , ” said Mr. Kenge .
Again Mr. Vholes said , “ Very much so . ” “ And as you say , Mr. Vholes , when the cause is in the paper next term , this document will be an unexpected and interesting feature in it , ” said Mr. Kenge , looking <unk> at my guardian .
Mr. Vholes was gratified , as a smaller practitioner striving to keep respectable , to be confirmed in any opinion of his own by such an authority .
“ And when , ” asked my guardian , rising after a pause , during which Mr. Kenge had rattled his money and Mr. Vholes had picked his <unk> , “ when is next term ? ” “ Next term , Mr. Jarndyce , will be next month , ” said Mr. Kenge .
“ Of course we shall at once proceed to do what is necessary with this document and to <unk> the necessary evidence concerning it ; and of course you will receive our usual <unk> of the cause being in the paper . ” “ To which I shall pay , of course , my usual attention . ” “ Still bent , my dear sir , ” said Mr. Kenge , showing us through the outer office to the door , “ still bent , even with your <unk> mind , on echoing a popular prejudice ?
We are a prosperous community , Mr. Jarndyce , a very prosperous community .
We are a great country , Mr. Jarndyce , we are a very great country .
This is a great system , Mr. Jarndyce , and would you wish a great country to have a little system ?
Now , really , really ! ” He said this at the <unk> , gently moving his right hand as if it were a silver <unk> with which to spread the <unk> of his words on the <unk> of the system and <unk> it for a thousand ages .
CHAPTER <unk> Steel and <unk> George ’ s Shooting Gallery is to let , and the stock is sold off , and George himself is at Chesney Wold attending on Sir Leicester in his <unk> and riding very near his <unk> because of the uncertain hand with which he <unk> his horse .
But not to-day is George so occupied .
He is <unk> to-day into the iron country farther north to look about him .
As he comes into the iron country farther north , such fresh green woods as those of Chesney Wold are left behind ; and coal <unk> and ashes , high chimneys and red bricks , blighted <unk> , <unk> fires , and a heavy <unk> cloud of smoke become the features of the <unk> .
Among such objects <unk> the trooper , looking about him and always looking for something he has come to find .
At last , on the black <unk> bridge of a busy town , with a <unk> of iron in it , and more fires and more smoke than he has seen yet , the trooper , <unk> with the dust of the coal roads , checks his horse and asks a workman does he know the name of Rouncewell <unk> .
“ Why , master , ” quoth the workman , “ do I know my own name ? ” “ ’ Tis so well known here , is it , comrade ? ” asks the trooper .
“ Rouncewell ’ s ?
Ah !
You ’ re right . ” “ And where might it be now ? ” asks the trooper with a glance before him .
“ The bank , the factory , or the house ? ” the workman wants to know .
“ Hum !
Rouncewell ’ s is so great apparently , ” mutters the trooper , <unk> his chin , “ that I have as good as half a mind to go back again .
Why , I don ’ t know which I want .
<unk> I find Mr. Rouncewell at the factory , do you think ? ” “ <unk> ’ t easy to say where you ’ d find him — at this time of the day you might find either him or his son there , if he ’ s in town ; but his <unk> take him away . ” And which is the factory ?
Why , he sees those chimneys — the <unk> ones !
Yes , he sees <unk> .
Well !
Let him keep his eye on those chimneys , going on as straight as ever he can , and presently he ’ ll see ’ em down a turning on the left , shut in by a great brick wall which forms one side of the street .
That ’ s Rouncewell ’ s .
The trooper thanks his <unk> and <unk> slowly on , looking about him .
He does not turn back , but puts up his horse ( and is much disposed to <unk> him too ) at a public-house where some of Rouncewell ’ s hands are <unk> , as the <unk> tells him .
Some of Rouncewell ’ s hands have just knocked off for <unk> and seem to be <unk> the whole town .
They are very <unk> and strong , are Rouncewell ’ s hands — a little <unk> too .
He comes to a gateway in the brick wall , looks in , and sees a great perplexity of iron lying about in every stage and in a vast variety of shapes — in bars , in <unk> , in sheets ; in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in wheels , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> ; twisted and <unk> into eccentric and <unk> forms as separate parts of <unk> ; mountains of it broken up , and rusty in its age ; distant <unk> of it glowing and <unk> in its youth ; bright <unk> of it <unk> about under the blows of the <unk> ; <unk> iron , <unk> iron , <unk> iron ; an iron taste , an iron smell , and a <unk> of iron sounds .
“ This is a place to make a man ’ s head ache too ! ” says the trooper , looking about him for a <unk> .
“ Who comes here ?
This is very like me before I was set up .
This ought to be my <unk> , if <unk> run in families .
Your servant , sir . ” “ <unk> , sir .
Are you looking for any one ? ” “ Excuse me .
Young Mr. Rouncewell , I believe ? ” “ Yes . ” “ I was looking for your father , sir .
I wish to have a word with him . ” The young man , telling him he is fortunate in his choice of a time , for his father is there , leads the way to the office where he is to be found .
“ Very like me before I was set up — <unk> like me ! ” thinks the trooper as he follows .
They come to a building in the yard with an office on an upper floor .
At sight of the gentleman in the office , Mr. George turns very red .
“ What name shall I say to my father ? ” asks the young man .
George , full of the idea of iron , in <unk> answers “ Steel , ” and is so presented .
He is left alone with the gentleman in the office , who sits at a table with <unk> before him and some sheets of paper blotted with <unk> of figures and <unk> of <unk> shapes .
It is a bare office , with bare windows , looking on the iron view below .
<unk> together on the table are some pieces of iron , purposely broken to be <unk> at various periods of their service , in various <unk> .
There is <unk> on everything ; and the smoke is seen through the windows rolling heavily out of the tall chimneys to <unk> with the smoke from a <unk> <unk> of other chimneys .
“ I am at your service , Mr. Steel , ” says the gentleman when his visitor has taken a rusty chair .
“ Well , Mr. Rouncewell , ” George replies , leaning forward with his left arm on his knee and his hat in his hand , and very <unk> of meeting his brother ’ s eye , “ I am not without my expectations that in the present visit I may prove to be more free than welcome .
I have served as a <unk> in my day , and a comrade of mine that I was once rather partial to was , if I don ’ t deceive myself , a brother of yours .
I believe you had a brother who gave his family some trouble , and ran away , and never did any good but in keeping away ? ” “ Are you quite sure , ” returns the ironmaster in an altered voice , “ that your name is Steel ? ” The trooper falters and looks at him .
His brother starts up , calls him by his name , and <unk> him by both hands .
“ You are too quick for me ! ” cries the trooper with the tears <unk> out of his eyes .
“ How do you do , my dear old fellow ?
I never could have thought you would have been half so glad to see me as all this .
How do you do , my dear old fellow , how do you do ! ” They shake hands and embrace each other over and over again , the trooper still <unk> his “ How do you do , my dear old fellow ! ” with his <unk> that he never thought his brother would have been half so glad to see him as all this !
“ So far from it , ” he declares at the end of a full account of what has preceded his arrival there , “ I had very little idea of making myself known .
I thought if you took by any means <unk> to my name I might gradually get myself up to the point of writing a letter .
But I should not have been surprised , brother , if you had considered it anything but welcome news to hear of me . ” “ We will show you at home what kind of news we think it , George , ” returns his brother .
“ This is a great day at home , and you could not have arrived , you <unk> old soldier , on a better .
I make an agreement with my son Watt to-day that on this day <unk> he shall marry as pretty and as good a girl as you have seen in all your <unk> .
She goes to <unk> to-morrow with one of your <unk> for a little <unk> up in her education .
We make a <unk> of the event , and you will be made the <unk> of it . ” Mr. George is so entirely overcome at first by this prospect that he <unk> the proposed honour with great earnestness .
Being <unk> , however , by his brother and his <unk> — concerning whom he <unk> his <unk> that he never could have thought they would have been half so glad to see him — he is taken home to an elegant house in all the arrangements of which there is to be observed a pleasant mixture of the originally simple habits of the father and mother with such as are suited to their altered station and the higher fortunes of their children .
Here Mr. George is much <unk> by the <unk> and <unk> of his <unk> that are and by the beauty of Rosa , his niece that is to be , and by the affectionate <unk> of these young ladies , which he receives in a sort of dream .
He is <unk> taken <unk> , too , by the dutiful behaviour of his <unk> and has a <unk> consciousness upon him of being a <unk> .
However , there is great <unk> and a very hearty company and infinite enjoyment , and Mr. George comes <unk> and martial through it all , and his <unk> to be present at the marriage and give away the bride is received with <unk> favour .
A <unk> head has Mr. George that night when he lies down in the <unk> of his brother ’ s house to think of all these things and to see the <unk> of his <unk> ( awful all the evening in their <unk> <unk> ) <unk> , after the German manner , over his <unk> .
The brothers are <unk> next morning in the ironmaster ’ s room , where the elder is proceeding , in his clear sensible way , to show how he thinks he may best dispose of George in his business , when George <unk> his hand and stops him .
“ <unk> , I thank you a million times for your more than brotherly welcome , and a million times more to that for your more than brotherly intentions .
But my plans are made .
Before I say a word as to them , I wish to consult you upon one family point .
How , ” says the trooper , folding his arms and looking with <unk> <unk> at his brother , “ how is my mother to be got to scratch me ? ” “ I am not sure that I understand you , George , ” replies the ironmaster .
“ I say , brother , how is my mother to be got to scratch me ?
She must be got to do it somehow . ” “ <unk> you out of her will , I think you mean ? ” “ Of course I do .
In short , ” says the trooper , folding his arms more <unk> yet , “ I mean — TO — scratch me ! ” “ My dear George , ” returns his brother , “ is it so <unk> that you should <unk> that process ? ” “ Quite !
<unk> !
I couldn ’ t be guilty of the meanness of coming back without it .
I should never be safe not to be off again .
I have not <unk> home to <unk> your children , if not yourself , brother , of your rights .
I , who <unk> mine long ago !
If I am to remain and hold up my head , I must be <unk> .
Come .
You are a man of celebrated <unk> and intelligence , and you can tell me how it ’ s to be brought about . ” “ I can tell you , George , ” replies the ironmaster deliberately , “ how it is not to be brought about , which I hope may answer the purpose as well .
Look at our mother , think of her , recall her emotion when she recovered you .
Do you believe there is a consideration in the world that would induce her to take such a step against her favourite son ?
Do you believe there is any chance of her consent , to balance against the <unk> it would be to her ( loving dear old lady ! )
to propose it ?
If you do , you are wrong .
No , George !
You must make up your mind to remain <unk> , I think . ” There is an amused smile on the ironmaster ’ s face as he watches his brother , who is pondering , deeply disappointed .
“ I think you may manage almost as well as if the thing were done , though . ” “ How , brother ? ” “ Being bent upon it , you can dispose by will of anything you have the misfortune to <unk> in any way you like , you know . ” “ That ’ s true ! ” says the trooper , pondering again .
Then he <unk> asks , with his hand on his brother ’ s , “ Would you mind mentioning that , brother , to your wife and family ? ” “ Not at all . ” “ Thank you .
You wouldn ’ t object to say , perhaps , that although an <unk> vagabond , I am a vagabond of the <unk> order , and not of the mean sort ? ” The ironmaster , <unk> his amused smile , <unk> .
“ Thank you .
Thank you .
It ’ s a weight off my mind , ” says the trooper with a <unk> of his chest as he <unk> his arms and puts a hand on each leg , “ though I had set my heart on being <unk> , too ! ” The brothers are very like each other , sitting face to face ; but a certain massive simplicity and absence of <unk> in the ways of the world is all on the trooper ’ s side .
“ Well , ” he proceeds , throwing off his disappointment , “ next and last , those plans of mine .
You have been so brotherly as to propose to me to fall in here and take my place among the <unk> of your perseverance and sense .
I thank you heartily .
It ’ s more than brotherly , as I said before , and I thank you heartily for it , ” shaking him a long time by the hand .
“ But the truth is , brother , I am a — I am a kind of a <unk> , and it ’ s too late to <unk> me in a regular garden . ” “ My dear George , ” returns the elder , <unk> his strong steady brow upon him and smiling confidently , “ leave that to me , and let me try . ” George shakes his head .
“ You could do it , I have not a doubt , if anybody could ; but it ’ s not to be done .
Not to be done , sir !
Whereas it so falls out , on the other hand , that I am able to be of some trifle of use to Sir Leicester Dedlock since his illness — brought on by family <unk> — and that he would rather have that help from our mother ’ s son than from anybody else . ” “ Well , my dear George , ” returns the other with a very slight shade upon his open face , “ if you prefer to serve in Sir Leicester Dedlock ’ s household <unk> — ” “ There it is , brother , ” cries the trooper , <unk> him , with his hand upon his knee again ; “ there it is !
You don ’ t take kindly to that idea ; I don ’ t mind it .
You are not used to being <unk> ; I am .
Everything about you is in perfect order and discipline ; everything about me requires to be kept so .
We are not accustomed to carry things with the same hand or to look at ’ em from the same point .
I don ’ t say much about my <unk> manners because I found myself pretty well at my ease last night , and they wouldn ’ t be noticed here , I dare say , once and away .
But I shall get on best at Chesney Wold , where there ’ s more room for a <unk> than there is here ; and the dear old lady will be made happy besides .
Therefore I accept of Sir Leicester Dedlock ’ s proposals .
When I come over next year to give away the bride , or whenever I come , I shall have the sense to keep the household <unk> in <unk> and not to <unk> it on your ground .
I thank you heartily again and am proud to think of the <unk> as they ’ ll be founded by you . ” “ You know yourself , George , ” says the elder brother , returning the <unk> of his hand , “ and perhaps you know me better than I know myself .
Take your way .
So that we don ’ t quite lose one another again , take your way . ” “ No fear of that ! ” returns the trooper .
“ Now , before I turn my horse ’ s head <unk> , brother , I will ask you — if you ’ ll be so good — to look over a letter for me .
I brought it with me to send from these parts , as Chesney Wold might be a painful name just now to the person it ’ s written to .
I am not much accustomed to correspondence myself , and I am particular respecting this present letter because I want it to be both <unk> and delicate . ” <unk> he hands a letter , closely written in somewhat pale ink but in a neat round hand , to the ironmaster , who reads as follows : Miss Esther Summerson , A communication having been made to me by Inspector Bucket of a letter to myself being found among the papers of a certain person , I take the liberty to make known to you that it was but a few lines of <unk> from abroad , when , where , and how to deliver an enclosed letter to a young and beautiful lady , then <unk> , in England .
I <unk> observed the same .
I further take the liberty to make known to you that it was got from me as a proof of handwriting only and that otherwise I would not have given it up , as appearing to be the most harmless in my possession , without being previously shot through the heart .
I further take the liberty to mention that if I could have supposed a certain unfortunate gentleman to have been in existence , I never could and never would have rested until I had discovered his retreat and <unk> my last <unk> with him , as my duty and my inclination would have equally been .
But he was ( <unk> ) reported <unk> , and assuredly went over the side of a <unk> at night in an <unk> <unk> within a few hours of her arrival from the <unk> <unk> , as I have myself heard both from officers and men on board , and know to have been ( <unk> ) confirmed .
I further take the liberty to state that in my humble quality as one of the <unk> and file , I am , and shall ever continue to be , your thoroughly devoted and admiring servant and that I esteem the qualities you possess above all others far beyond the limits of the present dispatch .
I have the honour to be , <unk> “ A little formal , ” observes the elder brother , <unk> it with a <unk> face .
“ But nothing that might not be sent to a pattern young lady ? ” asks the younger .
“ Nothing at all . ” Therefore it is <unk> and deposited for <unk> among the iron correspondence of the day .
This done , Mr. George takes a hearty farewell of the family party and prepares to <unk> and mount .
His brother , however , unwilling to part with him so soon , proposes to ride with him in a light open carriage to the place where he will <unk> for the night , and there remain with him until morning , a servant riding for so much of the journey on the <unk> old grey from Chesney Wold .
The offer , being <unk> accepted , is followed by a pleasant ride , a pleasant dinner , and a pleasant breakfast , all in brotherly <unk> .
Then they once more shake hands long and heartily and part , the ironmaster turning his face to the smoke and fires , and the trooper to the green country .
<unk> in the afternoon the subdued sound of his heavy military <unk> is heard on the turf in the avenue as he <unk> on with imaginary <unk> and <unk> of <unk> under the old <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> Esther ’ s Narrative <unk> after I had that conversation with my guardian , he put a <unk> paper in my hand one morning and said , “ This is for next month , my dear . ” I found in it two hundred pounds .
I now began very quietly to make such preparations as I thought were necessary .
<unk> my <unk> by my guardian ’ s taste , which I knew very well of course , I arranged my <unk> to please him and hoped I should be highly <unk> .
I did it all so quietly because I was not quite free from my old apprehension that Ada would be rather sorry and because my guardian was so quiet himself .
I had no doubt that under all the circumstances we should be married in the most private and simple manner .
Perhaps I should only have to say to Ada , “ Would you like to come and see me married to-morrow , my pet ? ” Perhaps our <unk> might even be as <unk> as her own , and I might not find it necessary to say anything about it until it was over .
I thought that if I were to choose , I would like this best .
The only <unk> I made was Mrs. Woodcourt .
I told her that I was going to be married to my guardian and that we had been engaged some time .
She highly <unk> .
She could never do enough for me and was remarkably softened now in comparison with what she had been when we first knew her .
There was no trouble she would not have taken to have been of use to me , but I need hardly say that I only allowed her to take as little as gratified her kindness without <unk> it .
Of course this was not a time to <unk> my guardian , and of course it was not a time for <unk> my darling .
So I had plenty of occupation , which I was glad of ; and as to Charley , she was absolutely not to be seen for needlework .
To <unk> herself with great heaps of it — <unk> full and tables full — and do a little , and spend a great deal of time in staring with her round eyes at what there was to do , and persuade herself that she was going to do it , were Charley ’ s great <unk> and <unk> .
Meanwhile , I must say , I could not agree with my guardian on the subject of the will , and I had some sanguine hopes of Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
Which of us was right will soon appear , but I certainly did encourage expectations .
In Richard , the discovery gave occasion for a burst of business and agitation that <unk> him up for a little time , but he had lost the <unk> even of hope now and seemed to me to retain only its <unk> <unk> .
From something my guardian said one day when we were talking about this , I understood that my marriage would not take place until after the <unk> we had been told to look forward to ; and I thought the more , for that , how rejoiced I should be if I could be married when Richard and Ada were a little more prosperous .
The term was very near indeed when my guardian was called out of town and went down into <unk> on Mr. Woodcourt ’ s business .
He had told me beforehand that his presence there would be necessary .
I had just come in one night from my dear girl ’ s and was sitting in the midst of all my new clothes , looking at them all around me and thinking , when a letter from my guardian was brought to me .
It asked me to join him in the country and mentioned by what <unk> my place was taken and at what time in the morning I should have to leave town .
It added in a <unk> that I would not be many hours from Ada .
I expected few things less than a journey at that time , but I was ready for it in half an hour and set off as appointed early next morning .
I <unk> all day , wondering all day what I could be wanted for at such a distance ; now I thought it might be for this purpose , and now I thought it might be for that purpose , but I was never , never , never near the truth .
It was night when I came to my journey ’ s end and found my guardian waiting for me .
This was a great relief , for towards evening I had begun to fear ( the more so as his letter was a very short one ) that he might be ill .
However , there he was , as well as it was possible to be ; and when I saw his genial face again at its brightest and best , I said to myself , he has been doing some other great kindness .
Not that it required much <unk> to say that , because I knew that his being there at all was an act of kindness .
<unk> was ready at the hotel , and when we were alone at table he said , “ <unk> of curiosity , no doubt , little woman , to know why I have brought you here ? ” “ Well , guardian , ” said I , “ without thinking myself a <unk> or you a <unk> <unk> , I am a little curious about it . ” “ Then to <unk> your night ’ s rest , my love , ” he returned gaily , “ I won ’ t wait until to-morrow to tell you .
I have very much wished to express to Woodcourt , somehow , my sense of his humanity to poor unfortunate Jo , his <unk> services to my young cousins , and his value to us all .
When it was decided that he should settle here , it came into my head that I might ask his acceptance of some <unk> and suitable little place to lay his own head in .
I therefore caused such a place to be looked out for , and such a place was found on very easy terms , and I have been touching it up for him and making it <unk> .
However , when I walked over it the day before yesterday and it was reported ready , I found that I was not housekeeper enough to know whether things were all as they ought to be .
So I sent off for the best little housekeeper that could possibly be got to come and give me her advice and opinion .
And here she is , ” said my guardian , “ laughing and crying both together ! ” Because he was so dear , so good , so <unk> .
I tried to tell him what I thought of him , but I could not <unk> a word .
“ <unk> , <unk> ! ” said my guardian .
“ You make too much of it , little woman .
Why , how you sob , Dame Durden , how you sob ! ” “ It is with <unk> pleasure , guardian — with a heart full of thanks . ” “ Well , well , ” said he .
“ I am delighted that you approve .
I thought you would .
I meant it as a pleasant surprise for the little mistress of Bleak House . ” I kissed him and dried my eyes .
“ I know now ! ” said I.
“ I have seen this in your face a long while . ” “ No ; have you really , my dear ? ” said he .
“ What a Dame Durden it is to read a face ! ” He was so <unk> cheerful that I could not long be otherwise , and was almost ashamed of having been otherwise at all .
When I went to bed , I cried .
I am bound to confess that I cried ; but I hope it was with pleasure , though I am not quite sure it was with pleasure .
I repeated every word of the letter twice over .
A most beautiful summer morning succeeded , and after breakfast we went out arm in arm to see the house of which I was to give my mighty housekeeping opinion .
We entered a flower-garden by a gate in a side wall , of which he had the key , and the first thing I saw was that the beds and flowers were all laid out according to the manner of my beds and flowers at home .
“ You see , my dear , ” observed my guardian , standing still with a delighted face to watch my looks , “ knowing there could be no better plan , I borrowed yours . ” We went on by a pretty little <unk> , where the <unk> were <unk> among the green leaves and the shadows of the <unk> were <unk> on the grass , to the house itself — a cottage , quite a rustic cottage of doll ’ s rooms ; but such a lovely place , so tranquil and so beautiful , with such a rich and smiling country spread around it ; with water sparkling away into the distance , here all <unk> with <unk> , there turning a <unk> mill ; at its nearest point glancing through a <unk> by the cheerful town , where <unk> were <unk> in bright groups and a <unk> was flying from a white <unk> that <unk> in the sweet west wind .
And still , as we went through the pretty rooms , out at the little rustic <unk> doors , and underneath the tiny wooden <unk> <unk> with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , I saw in the <unk> on the walls , in the colours of the furniture , in the arrangement of all the pretty objects , MY little tastes and <unk> , MY little <unk> and <unk> which they used to laugh at while they praised them , my odd ways everywhere .
I could not say enough in admiration of what was all so beautiful , but one secret doubt arose in my mind when I saw this , I thought , oh , would he be the happier for it !
Would it not have been better for his peace that I should not have been so brought before him ?
Because although I was not what he thought me , still he loved me very dearly , and it might remind him <unk> of what be believed he had lost .
I did not wish him to forget me — perhaps he might not have done so , without these <unk> to his memory — but my way was easier than his , and I could have <unk> myself even to that so that he had been the happier for it .
“ And now , little woman , ” said my guardian , whom I had never seen so proud and joyful as in showing me these things and watching my appreciation of them , “ now , last of all , for the name of this house . ” “ What is it called , dear guardian ? ” “ My child , ” said he , “ come and see , ” He took me to the porch , which he had <unk> <unk> , and said , pausing before we went out , “ My dear child , don ’ t you guess the name ? ” “ No ! ” said I.
We went out of the porch and he showed me written over it , Bleak House .
He led me to a seat among the leaves close by , and sitting down beside me and taking my hand in his , spoke to me thus , “ My darling girl , in what there has been between us , I have , I hope , been really <unk> for your happiness .
When I wrote you the letter to which you brought the answer , ” smiling as he referred to it , “ I had my own too much in view ; but I had yours too .
Whether , under different circumstances , I might ever have renewed the old dream I sometimes dreamed when you were very young , of making you my wife one day , I need not ask myself .
I did renew it , and I wrote my letter , and you brought your answer .
You are following what I say , my child ? ” I was cold , and I trembled violently , but not a word he uttered was lost .
As I sat looking fixedly at him and the sun ’ s <unk> <unk> , softly shining through the leaves upon his bare head , I felt as if the brightness on him must be like the brightness of the angels .
“ <unk> me , my love , but do not speak .
It is for me to speak now .
When it was that I began to doubt whether what I had done would really make you happy is no matter .
Woodcourt came home , and I soon had no doubt at all . ” I clasped him round the neck and hung my head upon his breast and wept .
“ Lie lightly , confidently here , my child , ” said he , pressing me gently to him .
“ I am your guardian and your father now .
<unk> confidently here . ” <unk> , like the gentle rustling of the leaves ; and <unk> , like the <unk> weather ; and <unk> and <unk> , like the sunshine , he went on .
“ <unk> me , my dear girl .
I had no doubt of your being contented and happy with me , being so dutiful and so devoted ; but I saw with whom you would be happier .
That I <unk> his secret when Dame Durden was blind to it is no wonder , for I knew the good that could never change in her better far than she did .
Well !
I have long been in Allan Woodcourt ’ s confidence , although he was not , until yesterday , a few hours before you came here , in mine .
But I would not have my Esther ’ s bright example lost ; I would not have a <unk> of my dear girl ’ s virtues <unk> and <unk> ; I would not have her admitted on <unk> into the line of Morgan ap-Kerrig , no , not for the weight in gold of all the mountains in <unk> ! ” He stopped to kiss me on the forehead , and I sobbed and wept afresh .
For I felt as if I could not bear the painful delight of his praise .
“ Hush , little woman !
Don ’ t cry ; this is to be a day of joy .
I have looked forward to it , ” he said <unk> , “ for months on months !
A few words more , Dame Trot , and I have said my say .
<unk> not to throw away one <unk> of my Esther ’ s worth , I took Mrs. Woodcourt into a separate confidence .
‘ Now , <unk> , ’ said I , ‘ I clearly perceive — and indeed I know , to <unk> — that your son loves my ward .
I am further very sure that my ward loves your son , but will sacrifice her love to a sense of duty and affection , and will sacrifice it so completely , so entirely , so <unk> , that you should never suspect it though you watched her night and day . ’ Then I told her all our story — ours — yours and mine .
‘ Now , <unk> , ’ said I , ‘ come you , knowing this , and live with us .
Come you , and see my child from hour to hour ; set what you see against her <unk> , which is this , and this ’ — for I <unk> to <unk> it — ‘ and tell me what is the true <unk> when you shall have quite made up your mind on that subject . ’ Why , honour to her old <unk> blood , my dear , ” cried my guardian with enthusiasm , “ I believe the heart it <unk> beats no less <unk> , no less <unk> , no less <unk> , towards Dame Durden than my own ! ” He tenderly raised my head , and as I clung to him , kissed me in his old fatherly way again and again .
What a light , now , on the <unk> manner I had thought about !
“ One more last word .
When Allan Woodcourt spoke to you , my dear , he spoke with my knowledge and consent — but I gave him no encouragement , not I , for these <unk> were my great reward , and I was too <unk> to part with a scrap of it .
He was to come and tell me all that passed , and he did .
I have no more to say .
My dearest , Allan Woodcourt stood beside your father when he lay dead — stood beside your mother .
This is Bleak House .
This day I give this house its little mistress ; and before God , it is the brightest day in all my life ! ” He rose and raised me with him .
We were no longer alone .
My husband — I have called him by that name full seven happy years now — stood at my side .
“ Allan , ” said my guardian , “ take from me a willing <unk> , the best wife that ever man had .
What more can I say for you than that I know you <unk> her !
Take with her the little home she brings you .
You know what she will make it , Allan ; you know what she has made its <unk> .
Let me share its <unk> sometimes , and what do I sacrifice ?
Nothing , nothing . ” He kissed me once again , and now the tears were in his eyes as he said more softly , “ Esther , my dearest , after so many years , there is a kind of parting in this too .
I know that my mistake has caused you some distress .
<unk> your old guardian , in <unk> him to his old place in your <unk> ; and <unk> it out of your memory .
Allan , take my dear . ” He moved away from under the green roof of leaves , and stopping in the sunlight outside and turning cheerfully towards us , said , “ I shall be found about here somewhere .
It ’ s a west wind , little woman , due west !
Let no one thank me any more , for I am going to <unk> to my <unk> habits , and if anybody <unk> this warning , I ’ ll run away and never come back ! ” What happiness was ours that day , what joy , what rest , what hope , what gratitude , what <unk> !
We were to be married before the month was out , but when we were to come and take possession of our own house was to depend on Richard and Ada .
We all three went home together next day .
As soon as we arrived in town , Allan went straight to see Richard and to carry our joyful news to him and my darling .
<unk> as it was , I meant to go to her for a few minutes before lying down to sleep , but I went home with my guardian first to make his tea for him and to occupy the old chair by his side , for I did not like to think of its being empty so soon .
When we came home we found that a young man had called three times in the course of that one day to see me and that having been told on the occasion of his third call that I was not expected to return before ten o ’ clock at night , he had left word that he would call about then .
He had left his card three times .
Mr. Guppy .
As I naturally <unk> on the object of these visits , and as I always associated something <unk> with the visitor , it fell out that in laughing about Mr. Guppy I told my guardian of his old proposal and his <unk> <unk> .
“ After that , ” said my guardian , “ we will certainly receive this <unk> . ” So instructions were given that Mr. Guppy should be shown in when he came again , and they were scarcely given when he did come again .
He was embarrassed when he found my guardian with me , but recovered himself and said , “ How de do , sir ? ” “ How do you do , sir ? ” returned my guardian .
“ Thank you , sir , I am <unk> , ” returned Mr. Guppy .
“ Will you allow me to <unk> my mother , Mrs. Guppy of the Old Street Road , and my particular friend , Mr. Weevle .
That is to say , my friend has gone by the name of Weevle , but his name is really and truly Jobling . ” My guardian begged them to be seated , and they all sat down .
“ Tony , ” said Mr. Guppy to his friend after an awkward silence .
“ Will you open the case ? ” “ Do it yourself , ” returned the friend rather <unk> .
“ Well , Mr. Jarndyce , sir , ” Mr. Guppy , after a moment ’ s consideration , began , to the great <unk> of his mother , which she <unk> by <unk> Mr. Jobling with her elbow and winking at me in a most remarkable manner , “ I had an idea that I should see Miss Summerson by herself and was not quite prepared for your esteemed presence .
But Miss Summerson has mentioned to you , perhaps , that something has passed between us on former occasions ? ” “ Miss Summerson , ” returned my guardian , smiling , “ has made a communication to that effect to me . ” “ That , ” said Mr. Guppy , “ makes matters easier .
Sir , I have come out of my articles at Kenge and Carboy ’ s , and I believe with satisfaction to all parties .
I am now admitted ( after <unk> an examination that ’ s enough to <unk> a man blue , touching a <unk> of nonsense that he don ’ t want to know ) on the roll of <unk> and have taken out my <unk> , if it would be any satisfaction to you to see it . ” “ Thank you , Mr. Guppy , ” returned my guardian .
“ I am quite willing — I believe I use a legal phrase — to admit the <unk> . ” Mr. Guppy therefore <unk> from taking something out of his pocket and proceeded without it .
“ I have no capital myself , but my mother has a little property which takes the form of an <unk> ” — here Mr. Guppy ’ s mother rolled her head as if she never could sufficiently enjoy the observation , and put her handkerchief to her mouth , and again <unk> at me — “ and a few pounds for expenses out of pocket in conducting business will never be wanting , free of interest , which is an advantage , you know , ” said Mr. Guppy feelingly .
“ Certainly an advantage , ” returned my guardian .
“ I HAVE some connexion , ” pursued Mr. Guppy , “ and it lays in the direction of <unk> Square , <unk> .
I have therefore taken a ’ ouse in that <unk> , which , in the opinion of my friends , is a hollow bargain ( <unk> ridiculous , and use of <unk> included in the rent ) , and intend setting up professionally for myself there <unk> . ” Here Mr. Guppy ’ s mother fell into an extraordinary passion of rolling her head and smiling <unk> at anybody who would look at her .
“ It ’ s a <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , ” said Mr. Guppy , “ and in the opinion of my friends , a <unk> <unk> .
When I mention my friends , I refer principally to my friend Jobling , who I believe has known me , ” Mr. Guppy looked at him with a <unk> air , “ from <unk> ’ s hour . ” Mr. Jobling confirmed this with a sliding movement of his legs .
“ My friend Jobling will render me his assistance in the capacity of clerk and will live in the ’ ouse , ” said Mr. Guppy .
“ My mother will likewise live in the ’ ouse when her present quarter in the Old Street Road shall have ceased and <unk> ; and consequently there will be no want of society .
My friend Jobling is naturally aristocratic by taste , and besides being acquainted with the movements of the upper circles , fully backs me in the intentions I am now <unk> . ” Mr. Jobling said “ Certainly ” and withdrew a little from the elbow of Mr Guppy ’ s mother .
“ Now , I have no occasion to mention to you , sir , you being in the confidence of Miss Summerson , ” said Mr. Guppy , “ ( mother , I wish you ’ d be so good as to keep still ) , that Miss Summerson ’ s image was formerly imprinted on my ’ eart and that I made her a proposal of marriage . ” “ That I have heard , ” returned my guardian .
“ <unk> , ” pursued Mr. Guppy , “ over which I had no control , but quite the contrary , <unk> the impression of that image for a time .
At which time Miss Summerson ’ s conduct was highly genteel ; I may even add , <unk> . ” My guardian patted me on the shoulder and seemed much amused .
“ Now , sir , ” said Mr. Guppy , “ I have got into that state of mind myself that I wish for a <unk> of <unk> behaviour .
I wish to prove to Miss Summerson that I can rise to a <unk> of which perhaps she hardly thought me capable .
I find that the image which I did suppose had been <unk> from my ’ eart is NOT <unk> .
Its influence over me is still <unk> , and yielding to it , I am willing to <unk> the circumstances over which none of us have had any control and to renew those proposals to Miss Summerson which I had the honour to make at a former period .
I beg to lay the ’ ouse in <unk> Square , the business , and myself before Miss Summerson for her acceptance . ” “ Very <unk> indeed , sir , ” observed my guardian .
“ Well , sir , ” replied Mr. Guppy with candour , “ my wish is to BE <unk> .
I do not consider that in making this offer to Miss Summerson I am by any means throwing myself away ; neither is that the opinion of my friends .
Still , there are circumstances which I submit may be taken into account as a set off against any little <unk> of mine , and so a fair and <unk> balance arrived at . ” “ I take upon myself , sir , ” said my guardian , laughing as he rang the bell , “ to reply to your proposals on behalf of Miss Summerson .
She is very sensible of your handsome intentions , and wishes you good evening , and wishes you well . ” “ Oh ! ” said Mr. Guppy with a blank look .
“ Is that <unk> , sir , to acceptance , or <unk> , or consideration ? ” “ To decided <unk> , if you please , ” returned my guardian .
Mr. Guppy looked <unk> at his friend , and at his mother , who suddenly turned very angry , and at the floor , and at the ceiling .
“ Indeed ? ” said he .
“ Then , Jobling , if you was the friend you represent yourself , I should think you might hand my mother out of the <unk> instead of <unk> her to remain where she ain ’ t wanted . ” But Mrs. Guppy positively refused to come out of the <unk> .
She wouldn ’ t hear of it .
“ Why , get along with you , ” said she to my guardian , “ what do you mean ?
Ain ’ t my son good enough for you ?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself .
Get out with you ! ” “ My good lady , ” returned my guardian , “ it is hardly reasonable to ask me to get out of my own room . ” “ I don ’ t care for that , ” said Mrs. Guppy .
“ Get out with you .
If we ain ’ t good enough for you , go and <unk> somebody that is good enough .
Go along and find ’ em . ” I was quite unprepared for the rapid manner in which Mrs. Guppy ’ s power of <unk> <unk> into a power of taking the <unk> offence .
“ Go along and find somebody that ’ s good enough for you , ” repeated Mrs. Guppy .
“ Get out ! ” Nothing seemed to <unk> Mr. Guppy ’ s mother so much and to make her so very indignant as our not getting out .
“ Why don ’ t you get out ? ” said Mrs. Guppy .
“ What are you stopping here for ? ” “ Mother , ” interposed her son , always getting before her and pushing her back with one shoulder as she <unk> at my guardian , “ WILL you hold your tongue ? ” “ No , William , ” she returned , “ I won ’ t !
Not unless he gets out , I won ’ t ! ” However , Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling together closed on Mr. Guppy ’ s mother ( who began to be quite <unk> ) and took her , very much against her will , downstairs , her voice rising a <unk> higher every time her figure got a <unk> lower , and <unk> that we should immediately go and find somebody who was good enough for us , and above all things that we should get out .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> the <unk> The term had commenced , and my guardian found an <unk> from Mr. Kenge that the cause would come on in two days .
As I had sufficient hopes of the will to be in a <unk> about it , Allan and I agreed to go down to the court that morning .
Richard was extremely <unk> and was so weak and low , though his illness was still of the mind , that my dear girl indeed had <unk> occasion to be supported .
But she looked forward — a very little way now — to the help that was to come to her , and never <unk> .
It was at Westminster that the cause was to come on .
It had come on there , I dare say , a hundred times before , but I could not <unk> myself of an idea that it <unk> lead to some result now .
We left home directly after breakfast to be at Westminster Hall in good time and walked down there through the lively streets — so happily and strangely it seemed ! — together .
As we were going along , <unk> what we should do for Richard and Ada , I heard somebody calling “ Esther !
My dear Esther !
Esther ! ” And there was Caddy Jellyby , with her head out of the window of a little carriage which she <unk> now to go about in to her pupils ( she had so many ) , as if she wanted to embrace me at a hundred yards ’ distance .
I had written her a note to tell her of all that my guardian had done , but had not had a moment to go and see her .
Of course we turned back , and the affectionate girl was in that state of rapture , and was so <unk> to talk about the night when she brought me the flowers , and was so determined to <unk> my face ( bonnet and all ) between her hands , and go on in a wild manner altogether , calling me all kinds of precious names , and telling Allan I had done I don ’ t know what for her , that I was just obliged to get into the little carriage and calm her down by letting her say and do exactly what she liked .
Allan , standing at the window , was as pleased as Caddy ; and I was as pleased as either of them ; and I wonder that I got away as I did , rather than that I came off laughing , and red , and anything but tidy , and looking after Caddy , who looked after us out of the <unk> as long as she could see us .
This made us some quarter of an hour late , and when we came to Westminster Hall we found that the day ’ s business was begun .
<unk> than that , we found such an unusual crowd in the Court of Chancery that it was full to the door , and we could neither see nor hear what was passing within .
It appeared to be something droll , for occasionally there was a laugh and a cry of “ <unk> ! ” It appeared to be something interesting , for every one was pushing and striving to get nearer .
It appeared to be something that made the professional gentlemen very merry , for there were several young <unk> in wigs and whiskers on the outside of the crowd , and when one of them told the others about it , they put their hands in their pockets , and quite <unk> themselves up with laughter , and went <unk> about the pavement of the Hall .
We asked a gentleman by us if he knew what cause was on .
He told us Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
We asked him if he knew what was doing in it .
He said really , no he did not , nobody ever did , but as well as he could make out , it was over .
Over for the day ?
we asked him .
No , he said , over for good .
Over for good !
When we heard this unaccountable answer , we looked at one another quite lost in amazement .
Could it be possible that the will had set things right at last and that Richard and Ada were going to be rich ?
It seemed too good to be true .
<unk> it was !
Our suspense was short , for a <unk> soon took place in the crowd , and the people came <unk> out looking flushed and hot and bringing a quantity of bad air with them .
Still they were all exceedingly amused and were more like people coming out from a <unk> or a <unk> than from a court of justice .
We stood aside , watching for any countenance we knew , and presently great bundles of paper began to be carried out — bundles in bags , bundles too large to be got into any bags , immense <unk> of papers of all shapes and no shapes , which the bearers <unk> under , and threw down for the time being , <unk> , on the Hall pavement , while they went back to bring out more .
Even these clerks were laughing .
We glanced at the papers , and seeing Jarndyce and Jarndyce everywhere , asked an <unk> person who was standing in the midst of them whether the cause was over .
Yes , he said , it was all up with it at last , and burst out laughing too .
At this <unk> we perceived Mr. Kenge coming out of court with an affable dignity upon him , listening to Mr. Vholes , who was deferential and carried his own bag .
Mr. Vholes was the first to see us .
“ Here is Miss Summerson , sir , ” he said .
“ And Mr. Woodcourt . ” “ Oh , indeed !
Yes .
Truly ! ” said Mr. Kenge , raising his hat to me with <unk> politeness .
“ How do you do ?
Glad to see you .
Mr. Jarndyce is not here ? ” No .
He never came there , I reminded him .
“ Really , ” returned Mr. Kenge , “ it is as well that he is NOT here to-day , for his — shall I say , in my good friend ’ s absence , his <unk> <unk> of opinion ? — might have been strengthened , perhaps ; not <unk> , but might have been strengthened . ” “ Pray what has been done to-day ? ” asked Allan .
“ I beg your pardon ? ” said Mr. Kenge with <unk> <unk> .
“ What has been done to-day ? ” “ What has been done , ” repeated Mr. Kenge .
“ Quite so .
Yes .
Why , not much has been done ; not much .
We have been checked — brought up suddenly , I would say — upon the — shall I term it threshold ? ” “ Is this will considered a genuine document , sir ? ” said Allan .
“ Will you tell us that ? ” “ Most certainly , if I could , ” said Mr. Kenge ; “ but we have not gone into that , we have not gone into that . ” “ We have not gone into that , ” repeated Mr. Vholes as if his low inward voice were an echo .
“ You are to reflect , Mr. Woodcourt , ” observed Mr. Kenge , using his silver <unk> <unk> and <unk> , “ that this has been a great cause , that this has been a <unk> cause , that this has been a <unk> cause .
Jarndyce and Jarndyce has been <unk> , not <unk> , a monument of Chancery practice . ” “ And patience has sat upon it a long time , ” said Allan .
“ Very well indeed , sir , ” returned Mr. Kenge with a certain condescending laugh he had .
“ Very well !
You are further to reflect , Mr. Woodcourt , ” becoming dignified almost to severity , “ that on the numerous difficulties , <unk> , masterly <unk> , and forms of <unk> in this great cause , there has been <unk> study , <unk> , eloquence , knowledge , <unk> , Mr. Woodcourt , high <unk> .
For many years , the — a — I would say the flower of the bar , and the — a — I would presume to add , the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> — have been <unk> upon Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
If the public have the <unk> , and if the country have the <unk> , of this great <unk> , it must be paid for in money or money ’ s worth , sir . ” “ Mr.
Kenge , ” said Allan , appearing <unk> all in a moment .
“ Excuse me , our time <unk> .
Do I understand that the whole estate is found to have been absorbed in costs ? ” “ Hem !
I believe so , ” returned Mr. Kenge .
“ Mr.
Vholes , what do YOU say ? ” “ I believe so , ” said Mr. Vholes .
“ And that thus the suit <unk> and <unk> away ? ” “ Probably , ” returned Mr. Kenge .
“ Mr.
Vholes ? ” “ Probably , ” said Mr. Vholes .
“ My dearest life , ” whispered Allan , “ this will break Richard ’ s heart ! ” There was such a shock of apprehension in his face , and he knew Richard so perfectly , and I too had seen so much of his <unk> <unk> , that what my dear girl had said to me in the fullness of her <unk> love sounded like a <unk> in my ears .
“ In case you should be wanting Mr. C. , sir , ” said Mr. Vholes , coming after us , “ you ’ ll find him in court .
I left him there resting himself a little .
Good day , sir ; good day , Miss Summerson . ” As he gave me that slowly <unk> look of his , while <unk> up the strings of his bag before he <unk> with it after Mr. Kenge , the benignant shadow of whose <unk> presence he seemed afraid to leave , he gave one gasp as if he had swallowed the last morsel of his client , and his black <unk> unwholesome figure <unk> away to the low door at the end of the Hall .
“ My dear love , ” said Allan , “ leave to me , for a little while , the charge you gave me .
Go home with this intelligence and come to Ada ’ s by and by ! ” I would not let him take me to a coach , but entreated him to go to Richard without a moment ’ s delay and leave me to do as he wished .
<unk> home , I found my guardian and told him gradually with what news I had returned .
“ Little woman , ” said he , quite unmoved for himself , “ to have done with the suit on any terms is a greater blessing than I had looked for .
But my poor young cousins ! ” We talked about them all the morning and discussed what it was possible to do .
In the afternoon my guardian walked with me to Symond ’ s Inn and left me at the door .
I went upstairs .
When my darling heard my footsteps , she came out into the small passage and threw her arms round my neck , but she composed herself directly and said that Richard had asked for me several times .
Allan had found him sitting in the corner of the court , she told me , like a stone figure .
On being <unk> , he had broken away and made as if he would have spoken in a fierce voice to the judge .
He was stopped by his mouth being full of blood , and Allan had brought him home .
He was lying on a sofa with his eyes closed when I went in .
There were <unk> on the table ; the room was made as airy as possible , and was darkened , and was very orderly and quiet .
Allan stood behind him watching him gravely .
His face appeared to me to be quite <unk> of colour , and now that I saw him without his seeing me , I fully saw , for the first time , how worn away he was .
But he looked <unk> than I had seen him look for many a day .
I sat down by his side in silence .
<unk> his eyes by and by , he said in a weak voice , but with his old smile , “ Dame Durden , kiss me , my dear ! ” It was a great comfort and surprise to me to find him in his low state cheerful and looking forward .
He was happier , he said , in our intended marriage than he could find words to tell me .
My husband had been a guardian angel to him and Ada , and he blessed us both and wished us all the joy that life could yield us .
I almost felt as if my own heart would have broken when I saw him take my husband ’ s hand and hold it to his breast .
We spoke of the future as much as possible , and he said several times that he must be present at our marriage if he could stand upon his feet .
Ada would <unk> to take him , somehow , he said .
“ Yes , surely , dearest Richard ! ” But as my darling answered him thus hopefully , so serene and beautiful , with the help that was to come to her so near — I knew — I knew !
It was not good for him to talk too much , and when he was silent , we were silent too .
<unk> beside him , I made a pretence of working for my dear , as he had always been used to joke about my being busy .
Ada leaned upon his pillow , holding his head upon her arm .
He <unk> often , and whenever he awoke without seeing him , said first of all , “ Where is Woodcourt ? ” <unk> had come on when I lifted up my eyes and saw my guardian standing in the little hall .
“ Who is that , Dame Durden ? ” Richard asked me .
The door was behind him , but he had observed in my face that some one was there .
I looked to Allan for advice , and as he nodded “ Yes , ” bent over Richard and told him .
My guardian saw what passed , came softly by me in a moment , and laid his hand on Richard ’ s .
“ Oh , sir , ” said Richard , “ you are a good man , you are a good man ! ” and burst into tears for the first time .
My guardian , the picture of a good man , sat down in my place , keeping his hand on Richard ’ s .
“ My dear Rick , ” said he , “ the clouds have cleared away , and it is bright now .
We can see now .
We were all <unk> , Rick , more or less .
What matters !
And how are you , my dear boy ? ” “ I am very weak , sir , but I hope I shall be stronger .
I have to begin the world . ” “ Aye , truly ; well said ! ” cried my guardian .
“ I will not begin it in the old way now , ” said Richard with a sad smile .
“ I have learned a lesson now , sir .
It was a hard one , but you shall be assured , indeed , that I have learned it . ” “ Well , well , ” said my guardian , <unk> him ; “ well , well , well , dear boy ! ” “ I was thinking , sir , ” resumed Richard , “ that there is nothing on earth I should so much like to see as their house — Dame Durden ’ s and Woodcourt ’ s house .
If I could be removed there when I begin to recover my strength , I feel as if I should get well there sooner than anywhere . ” “ Why , so have I been thinking too , Rick , ” said my guardian , “ and our little woman likewise ; she and I have been talking of it this very day .
I dare say her husband won ’ t object .
What do you think ? ” Richard smiled and lifted up his arm to touch him as he stood behind the head of the couch .
“ I say nothing of Ada , ” said Richard , “ but I think of her , and have thought of her very much .
Look at her !
See her here , sir , bending over this pillow when she has so much need to rest upon it herself , my dear love , my poor girl ! ” He clasped her in his arms , and none of us spoke .
He gradually released her , and she looked upon us , and looked up to heaven , and moved her lips .
“ When I get down to Bleak House , ” said Richard , “ I shall have much to tell you , sir , and you will have much to show me .
You will go , won ’ t you ? ” “ <unk> , dear Rick . ” “ Thank you ; like you , like you , ” said Richard .
“ But it ’ s all like you .
They have been telling me how you <unk> it and how you remembered all Esther ’ s familiar tastes and ways .
It will be like coming to the old Bleak House again . ” “ And you will come there too , I hope , Rick .
I am a solitary man now , you know , and it will be a charity to come to me .
A charity to come to me , my love ! ” he repeated to Ada as he gently passed his hand over her golden hair and put a lock of it to his lips .
( I think he <unk> within himself to <unk> her if she were left alone . )
“ It was a troubled dream ? ” said Richard , <unk> both my guardian ’ s hands <unk> .
“ Nothing more , Rick ; nothing more . ” “ And you , being a good man , can pass it as such , and forgive and pity the <unk> , and be <unk> and encouraging when he <unk> ? ” “ Indeed I can .
What am I but another <unk> , Rick ? ” “ I will begin the world ! ” said Richard with a light in his eyes .
My husband drew a little nearer towards Ada , and I saw him solemnly lift up his hand to warn my guardian .
“ When shall I go from this place to that pleasant country where the old times are , where I shall have strength to tell what Ada has been to me , where I shall be able to recall my many faults and <unk> , where I shall prepare myself to be a guide to my <unk> child ? ” said Richard .
“ When shall I go ? ” “ Dear Rick , when you are strong enough , ” returned my guardian .
“ Ada , my darling ! ” He sought to raise himself a little .
Allan raised him so that she could hold him on her bosom , which was what he wanted .
“ I have done you many wrongs , my own .
I have fallen like a poor stray shadow on your way , I have married you to <unk> and trouble , I have scattered your means to the winds .
You will forgive me all this , my Ada , before I begin the world ? ” A smile <unk> his face as she bent to kiss him .
He slowly laid his face down upon her bosom , drew his arms closer round her neck , and with one parting sob began the world .
Not this world , oh , not this !
The world that sets this right .
When all was still , at a late hour , poor <unk> Miss Flite came weeping to me and told me she had given her birds their liberty .
CHAPTER <unk> Down in Lincolnshire There is a <unk> upon Chesney Wold in these altered days , as there is upon a portion of the family history .
The story goes that Sir Leicester paid some who could have spoken out to hold their peace ; but it is a lame story , <unk> whispering and creeping about , and any brighter <unk> of life it shows soon dies away .
It is known for certain that the handsome Lady Dedlock lies in the <unk> in the park , where the trees arch <unk> overhead , and the <unk> is heard at night making the woods ring ; but whence she was brought home to be laid among the <unk> of that solitary place , or how she died , is all mystery .
Some of her old friends , principally to be found among the <unk> <unk> with the skeleton throats , did once occasionally say , as they <unk> in a <unk> manner with large <unk> — like <unk> <unk> to <unk> with grim death , after losing all their other <unk> — did once occasionally say , when the world assembled together , that they wondered the ashes of the Dedlocks , <unk> in the <unk> , never rose against the <unk> of her company .
But the <unk> Dedlocks take it very calmly and have never been known to object .
Up from among the fern in the hollow , and winding by the <unk> among the trees , comes sometimes to this lonely spot the sound of horses ’ <unk> .
Then may be seen Sir Leicester — <unk> , bent , and almost blind , but of worthy presence yet — riding with a stalwart man beside him , constant to his <unk> .
When they come to a certain spot before the <unk> , Sir Leicester ’ s accustomed horse stops of his own <unk> , and Sir Leicester , pulling off his hat , is still for a few moments before they ride away .
<unk> <unk> yet with the <unk> Boythorn , though at uncertain intervals , and now <unk> , and now coolly , <unk> like an <unk> fire .
The truth is said to be that when Sir Leicester came down to Lincolnshire for good , Mr. Boythorn showed a <unk> desire to abandon his right of way and do whatever Sir Leicester would , which Sir Leicester , <unk> to be a condescension to his illness or misfortune , took in such high <unk> , and was so <unk> <unk> by , that Mr. Boythorn found himself under the necessity of <unk> a <unk> trespass to restore his <unk> to himself .
<unk> , Mr. Boythorn continues to post tremendous <unk> on the disputed thoroughfare and ( with his bird upon his head ) to hold forth <unk> against Sir Leicester in the sanctuary of his own home ; <unk> , also , he <unk> him as of old in the little church by <unk> a <unk> <unk> of his existence .
But it is whispered that when he is most ferocious towards his old <unk> , he is really most considerate , and that Sir Leicester , in the dignity of being <unk> , little supposes how much he is <unk> .
As little does he think how near together he and his <unk> have suffered in the fortunes of two sisters , and his <unk> , who knows it now , is not the man to tell him .
So the quarrel goes on to the satisfaction of both .
In one of the lodges of the park — that lodge within sight of the house where , once upon a time , when the waters were out down in Lincolnshire , my Lady used to see the keeper ’ s child — the stalwart man , the trooper formerly , is <unk> .
Some <unk> of his old calling hang upon the walls , and these it is the chosen <unk> of a little lame man about the <unk> to keep <unk> bright .
A busy little man he always is , in the <unk> at <unk> doors , of <unk> , bits , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , anything in the way of a <unk> that will take a polish , leading a life of <unk> .
A <unk> little <unk> man , <unk> , not unlike an old dog of some <unk> breed , who has been considerably knocked about .
He answers to the name of Phil .
A goodly sight it is to see the grand old housekeeper ( harder of hearing now ) going to church on the arm of her son and to observe — which few do , for the house is <unk> of company in these times — the relations of both towards Sir Leicester , and his towards them .
They have visitors in the high summer weather , when a grey cloak and umbrella , unknown to Chesney Wold at other periods , are seen among the leaves ; when two young ladies are occasionally found <unk> in <unk> <unk> and such <unk> of the park ; and when the smoke of two pipes <unk> away into the <unk> evening air from the trooper ’ s door .
Then is a fife heard <unk> within the lodge on the <unk> <unk> of the “ British <unk> ” ; and as the evening closes in , a <unk> inflexible voice is heard to say , while two men pace together up and down , “ But I never own to it before the old girl .
Discipline must be maintained . ” The greater part of the house is shut up , and it is a <unk> no longer ; yet Sir Leicester holds his <unk> state in the long drawing-room for all that , and <unk> in his old place before my Lady ’ s picture .
<unk> in by night with broad screens , and <unk> only in that part , the light of the drawing-room seems gradually <unk> and <unk> until it shall be no more .
A little more , in truth , and it will be all <unk> for Sir Leicester ; and the damp door in the <unk> which shuts so tight , and looks so <unk> , will have opened and received him .
Volumnia , growing with the flight of time <unk> as to the red in her face , and <unk> as to the white , reads to Sir Leicester in the long evenings and is driven to various <unk> to conceal her <unk> , of which the chief and most <unk> is the <unk> of the pearl necklace between her rosy lips .
<unk> <unk> on the Buffy and Boodle question , showing how Buffy is <unk> and Boodle <unk> , and how the country is lost by being all Boodle and no Buffy , or saved by being all Buffy and no Boodle ( it must be one of the two , and cannot be anything else ) , are the <unk> of her reading .
Sir Leicester is not particular what it is and does not appear to follow it very closely , further than that he always comes broad awake the moment Volumnia ventures to leave off , and <unk> repeating her last words , begs with some displeasure to know if she finds herself fatigued .
However , Volumnia , in the course of her <unk> hopping about and <unk> at papers , has alighted on a <unk> concerning herself in the event of “ anything <unk> ” to her kinsman , which is handsome <unk> for an <unk> course of reading and holds even the dragon <unk> at <unk> .
The cousins generally are rather shy of Chesney Wold in its <unk> , but take to it a little in the shooting season , when guns are heard in the <unk> , and a few scattered <unk> and <unk> wait at the old places of appointment for low-spirited <unk> and <unk> of cousins .
The debilitated cousin , more debilitated by the <unk> of the place , gets into a fearful state of <unk> , <unk> under <unk> <unk> in his <unk> hours and protesting that such <unk> old <unk> ’ s — <unk> t ’ <unk> fler up — <unk> .
The only great occasions for Volumnia in this changed aspect of the place in Lincolnshire are those occasions , rare and <unk> separated , when something is to be done for the county or the country in the way of <unk> a public ball .
Then , indeed , does the <unk> <unk> come out in fairy form and proceed with joy under cousinly escort to the exhausted old <unk> , <unk> heavy miles off , which , during three hundred and <unk> days and nights of every ordinary year , is a kind of <unk> <unk> full of old chairs and tables <unk> down .
Then , indeed , does she <unk> all hearts by her condescension , by her <unk> <unk> , and by her <unk> about as in the days when the hideous old general with the mouth too full of teeth had not cut one of them at two guineas each .
Then does she <unk> and <unk> , a <unk> <unk> of good family , through the <unk> of the dance .
Then do the <unk> appear with tea , with <unk> , with <unk> , with homage .
Then is she kind and cruel , stately and <unk> , various , <unk> <unk> .
Then is there a singular kind of <unk> between her and the little glass <unk> of another age <unk> that <unk> , which , with their <unk> <unk> , their spare little drops , their <unk> knobs where no drops are , their bare little <unk> from which knobs and drops have both departed , and their little feeble <unk> <unk> , all seem <unk> .
For the rest , Lincolnshire life to Volumnia is a vast blank of <unk> house looking out upon trees , <unk> , <unk> their hands , bowing their heads , and casting their tears upon the <unk> in monotonous <unk> .
A <unk> of grandeur , less the property of an old family of human <unk> and their ghostly <unk> than of an old family of <unk> and <unk> which start out of their hundred graves at every sound and go <unk> through the building .
A waste of <unk> passages and staircases in which to drop a <unk> upon a bedroom floor at night is to send a <unk> <unk> on an errand through the house .
A place where few people care to go about alone , where a maid <unk> if an <unk> drops from the fire , takes to crying at all times and seasons , becomes the victim of a low disorder of the spirits , and gives warning and departs .
Thus Chesney Wold .
With so much of itself abandoned to darkness and <unk> ; with so little change under the summer shining or the wintry lowering ; so <unk> and motionless always — no <unk> flying now by day , no rows of lights sparkling by night ; with no family to come and go , no visitors to be the <unk> of pale cold shapes of rooms , no stir of life about it — passion and pride , even to the stranger ’ s eye , have died away from the place in Lincolnshire and yielded it to dull repose .
CHAPTER <unk> The <unk> of Esther ’ s Narrative <unk> seven happy years I have been the mistress of Bleak House .
The few words that I have to add to what I have written are soon <unk> ; then I and the unknown friend to whom I write will part for ever .
Not without much dear remembrance on my side .
Not without some , I hope , on his or hers .
They gave my darling into my arms , and through many weeks I never left her .
The little child who was to have done so much was born before the turf was planted on its father ’ s grave .
It was a boy ; and I , my husband , and my guardian gave him his father ’ s name .
The help that my dear counted on did come to her , though it came , in the eternal wisdom , for another purpose .
Though to bless and restore his mother , not his father , was the errand of this baby , its power was mighty to do it .
When I saw the strength of the weak little hand and how its touch could <unk> my darling ’ s heart and raised hope within her , I felt a new sense of the goodness and the tenderness of God .
They <unk> , and by degrees I saw my dear girl pass into my country garden and walk there with her infant in her arms .
I was married then .
I was the happiest of the happy .
It was at this time that my guardian joined us and asked Ada when she would come home .
“ Both houses are your home , my dear , ” said he , “ but the older Bleak House claims <unk> .
When you and my boy are strong enough to do it , come and take possession of your home . ” Ada called him “ her dearest cousin , John . ” But he said , no , it must be guardian now .
He was her guardian henceforth , and the boy ’ s ; and he had an old association with the name .
So she called him guardian , and has called him guardian ever since .
The children know him by no other name .
I say the children ; I have two little daughters .
It is difficult to believe that Charley ( <unk> still , and not at all <unk> ) is married to a <unk> in our neighbourhood ; yet so it is ; and even now , looking up from my desk as I write early in the morning at my summer window , I see the very mill beginning to go round .
I hope the <unk> will not spoil Charley ; but he is very fond of her , and Charley is rather vain of such a <unk> , for he is well to do and was in great request .
So far as my small maid is concerned , I might suppose time to have stood for seven years as still as the mill did half an hour ago , since little Emma , Charley ’ s sister , is exactly what Charley used to be .
As to Tom , Charley ’ s brother , I am really afraid to say what he did at school in <unk> , but I think it was <unk> .
He is <unk> to the <unk> , whatever it was , and is a good <unk> fellow , always falling in love with somebody and being ashamed of it .
Caddy Jellyby passed her very last <unk> with us and was a <unk> creature than ever , <unk> dancing in and out of the house with the children as if she had never given a <unk> in her life .
Caddy keeps her own little carriage now instead of <unk> one , and lives full two miles further <unk> than Newman Street .
She works very hard , her husband ( an excellent one ) being lame and able to do very little .
Still , she is more than contented and does all she has to do with all her heart .
Mr. Jellyby <unk> his evenings at her new house with his head against the wall as he used to do in her old one .
I have heard that Mrs. Jellyby was understood to suffer great <unk> from her daughter ’ s <unk> marriage and pursuits , but I hope she got over it in time .
She has been disappointed in Borrioboola-Gha , which turned out a failure in consequence of the king of <unk> wanting to sell everybody — who <unk> the <unk> — for <unk> , but she has taken up with the rights of women to sit in Parliament , and Caddy tells me it is a mission <unk> more correspondence than the old one .
I had almost forgotten Caddy ’ s poor little girl .
She is not such a mite now , but she is deaf and dumb .
I believe there never was a better mother than Caddy , who <unk> , in her <unk> intervals of leisure , innumerable deaf and dumb arts to soften the affliction of her child .
As if I were never to have done with Caddy , I am reminded here of Peepy and old Mr. Turveydrop .
Peepy is in the <unk> House , and doing extremely well .
Old Mr. Turveydrop , very <unk> , still <unk> his deportment about town , still <unk> himself in the old manner , is still believed in in the old way .
He is constant in his patronage of Peepy and is understood to have <unk> him a favourite French clock in his <unk> — which is not his property .
With the first money we saved at home , we added to our pretty house by throwing out a little growlery expressly for my guardian , which we <unk> with great splendour the next time he came down to see us .
I try to write all this lightly , because my heart is full in drawing to an end , but when I write of him , my tears will have their way .
I never look at him but I hear our poor dear Richard calling him a good man .
To Ada and her pretty boy , he is the <unk> father ; to me he is what he has ever been , and what name can I give to that ?
He is my husband ’ s best and dearest friend , he is our children ’ s darling , he is the object of our deepest love and <unk> .
Yet while I feel towards him as if he were a superior being , I am so familiar with him and so easy with him that I almost wonder at myself .
I have never lost my old names , nor has he lost his ; nor do I ever , when he is with us , sit in any other place than in my old chair at his side , Dame Trot , Dame Durden , Little <unk> — all just the same as ever ; and I answer , “ Yes , dear guardian ! ” just the same .
I have never known the wind to be in the east for a single moment since the day when he took me to the porch to read the name .
I remarked to him once that the wind seemed never in the east now , and he said , no , truly ; it had finally departed from that quarter on that very day .
I think my darling girl is more beautiful than ever .
The sorrow that has been in her face — for it is not there now — seems to have <unk> even its innocent expression and to have given it a <unk> quality .
Sometimes when I raise my eyes and see her in the black dress that she still wears , teaching my Richard , I feel — it is difficult to express — as if it were so good to know that she remembers her dear Esther in her prayers .
I call him my Richard !
But he says that he has two <unk> , and I am one .
We are not rich in the bank , but we have always <unk> , and we have quite enough .
I never walk out with my husband but I hear the people bless him .
I never go into a house of any degree but I hear his <unk> or see them in grateful eyes .
I never lie down at night but I know that in the course of that day he has <unk> pain and <unk> some <unk> in the time of need .
I know that from the beds of those who were past recovery , thanks have often , often gone up , in the last hour , for his patient <unk> .
Is not this to be rich ?
The people even praise me as the doctor ’ s wife .
The people even like me as I go about , and make so much of me that I am quite abashed .
I owe it all to him , my love , my pride !
They like me for his sake , as I do everything I do in life for his sake .
A night or two ago , after <unk> about preparing for my darling and my guardian and little Richard , who are coming to-morrow , I was sitting out in the porch of all places , that dearly memorable porch , when Allan came home .
So he said , “ My precious little woman , what are you doing here ? ” And I said , “ The moon is shining so brightly , Allan , and the night is so delicious , that I have been sitting here thinking . ” “ What have you been thinking about , my dear ? ” said Allan then .
“ How curious you are ! ” said I.
“ I am almost ashamed to tell you , but I will .
I have been thinking about my old looks — such as they were . ” “ And what have you been thinking about <unk> , my busy bee ? ” said Allan .
“ I have been thinking that I thought it was impossible that you <unk> have loved me any better , even if I had <unk> them . ” “ ‘ Such as they were ’ ? ” said Allan , laughing .
