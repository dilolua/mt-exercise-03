The <unk> of Esther ’ s Narrative <unk> A Chancery judge once had the kindness to inform me , as one of a company of some hundred and fifty men and women not labouring under any suspicions of lunacy , that the Court of Chancery , though the shining subject of much popular prejudice ( at which point I thought the judge ’ s eye had a cast in my direction ) , was almost <unk> .
There had been , he admitted , a trivial <unk> or so in its rate of progress , but this was <unk> and had been entirely <unk> to the “ <unk> of the public , ” which guilty public , it appeared , had been until lately bent in the most determined manner on by no means <unk> the number of Chancery <unk> appointed — I believe by Richard the Second , but any other king will do as well .
This seemed to me too profound a joke to be <unk> in the body of this book or I should have restored it to Conversation Kenge or to Mr. Vholes , with one or other of whom I think it must have originated .
In such <unk> I might have <unk> it with an apt <unk> from one of <unk> ’ s <unk> : “ My nature is subdued To what it works in , like the <unk> ’ s hand : <unk> me , then , and wish I were renewed ! ” But as it is wholesome that the <unk> public should know what has been doing , and still is doing , in this connexion , I mention here that everything set forth in these pages concerning the Court of Chancery is <unk> true , and within the truth .
The case of Gridley is in no essential altered from one of actual occurrence , made public by a disinterested person who was professionally acquainted with the whole of the monstrous wrong from beginning to end .
At the present moment ( <unk> , <unk> ) there is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago , in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time , in which costs have been <unk> to the amount of seventy thousand pounds , which is A <unk> <unk> , and which is ( I am assured ) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun .
There is another <unk> suit in Chancery , not yet decided , which was commenced before the close of the last century and in which more than double the amount of seventy thousand pounds has been swallowed up in costs .
If I wanted other authorities for Jarndyce and Jarndyce , I could rain them on these pages , to the shame of — a <unk> public .
There is only one other point on which I offer a word of remark .
The possibility of what is called spontaneous combustion has been <unk> since the death of Mr. Krook ; and my good friend Mr. <unk> ( quite mistaken , as he soon found , in supposing the thing to have been abandoned by all authorities ) published some <unk> letters to me at the time when that event was <unk> , arguing that spontaneous combustion could not possibly be .
I have no need to observe that I do not <unk> or <unk> <unk> my <unk> and that before I wrote that description I took pains to <unk> the subject .
There are about thirty cases on <unk> , of which the most famous , that of the <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> , was <unk> <unk> and described by <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> , otherwise distinguished in letters , who published an account of it at <unk> in <unk> , which he afterwards <unk> at <unk> .
The appearances , beyond all <unk> doubt , observed in that case are the appearances observed in Mr. Krook ’ s case .
The next most famous instance happened at <unk> six years earlier , and the <unk> in that case is <unk> <unk> , one of the most <unk> <unk> produced by <unk> .
The subject was a woman , whose husband was <unk> <unk> of having murdered her ; but on solemn appeal to a higher court , he was <unk> because it was shown upon the evidence that she had died the death of which this name of spontaneous combustion is given .
I do not think it necessary to add to these <unk> facts , and that general reference to the authorities which will be found at page <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> . , * the <unk> opinions and experiences of distinguished medical <unk> , French , English , and <unk> , in more <unk> days , <unk> myself with observing that I shall not abandon the facts until there shall have been a considerable spontaneous combustion of the testimony on which human occurrences are usually received .
* * In Bleak House I have purposely dwelt upon the romantic side of familiar things .
<unk> * <unk> ’ s note .
This referred to a <unk> page in the printed book .
In this Project Gutenberg <unk> the <unk> information is in <unk> <unk> , paragraph <unk> .
* * Another case , very clearly described by a <unk> , occurred at the town of <unk> , in the United States of America , quite recently .
The subject was a German who kept a <unk> and was an <unk> <unk> .
CHAPTER I In Chancery London .
<unk> term lately over , and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln ’ s Inn Hall .
<unk> November weather .
As much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth , and it would not be wonderful to meet a <unk> , forty feet long or so , <unk> like an <unk> <unk> up Holborn <unk> .
<unk> lowering down from <unk> , making a soft black <unk> , with <unk> of soot in it as <unk> as <unk> <unk> — gone into mourning , one might imagine , for the death of the sun .
<unk> , <unk> in mire .
<unk> , scarcely better ; <unk> to their very <unk> .
<unk> passengers , <unk> one another ’ s <unk> in a general <unk> of ill temper , and losing their <unk> at <unk> , where tens of thousands of other foot passengers have been <unk> and sliding since the day broke ( if this day ever broke ) , adding new deposits to the <unk> upon <unk> of mud , sticking at those points <unk> to the pavement , and <unk> at compound interest .
Fog everywhere .
Fog up the river , where it <unk> among green <unk> and <unk> ; fog down the river , where it rolls <unk> among the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of a great ( and dirty ) city .
Fog on the <unk> marshes , fog on the <unk> heights .
Fog creeping into the <unk> of <unk> ; fog lying out on the yards and hovering in the <unk> of great ships ; fog drooping on the <unk> of <unk> and small boats .
Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient <unk> <unk> , <unk> by the <unk> of their wards ; fog in the <unk> and <unk> of the afternoon pipe of the <unk> <unk> , down in his close <unk> ; fog <unk> pinching the <unk> and fingers of his shivering little ’ <unk> boy on <unk> .
<unk> people on the bridges peeping over the <unk> into a <unk> sky of fog , with fog all round them , as if they were up in a <unk> and hanging in the <unk> clouds .
<unk> <unk> through the fog in <unk> places in the streets , much as the sun may , from the <unk> fields , be seen to <unk> by <unk> and <unk> .
Most of the shops lighted two hours before their time — as the gas seems to know , for it has a haggard and unwilling look .
The raw afternoon is <unk> , and the dense fog is <unk> , and the muddy streets are <unk> near that <unk> old <unk> , <unk> <unk> for the threshold of a <unk> old <unk> , Temple <unk> .
And hard by Temple <unk> , in Lincoln ’ s Inn Hall , at the very heart of the fog , sits the Lord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery .
Never can there come fog too thick , never can there come mud and mire too deep , to <unk> with the groping and <unk> condition which this High Court of Chancery , most <unk> of <unk> <unk> , holds this day in the sight of heaven and earth .
On such an afternoon , if ever , the Lord High Chancellor ought to be sitting here — as here he is — with a <unk> glory round his head , softly <unk> in with <unk> cloth and curtains , addressed by a large <unk> with great whiskers , a little voice , and an <unk> brief , and outwardly directing his contemplation to the lantern in the roof , where he can see nothing but fog .
On such an afternoon some score of members of the High Court of Chancery bar ought to be — as here they are — <unk> engaged in one of the ten thousand <unk> of an <unk> cause , <unk> one another up on <unk> precedents , groping <unk> in <unk> , running their <unk> and <unk> <unk> heads against walls of words and making a pretence of equity with serious faces , as <unk> might .
On such an afternoon the various solicitors in the cause , some two or three of whom have inherited it from their fathers , who made a fortune by it , ought to be — as are they not ? — <unk> in a line , in a long <unk> well ( but you might look in vain for truth at the bottom of it ) between the <unk> ’ s red table and the silk gowns , with bills , <unk> , answers , <unk> , injunctions , affidavits , <unk> , references to masters , masters ’ reports , mountains of <unk> nonsense , <unk> before them .
Well may the court be dim , with <unk> candles here and there ; well may the fog hang heavy in it , as if it would never get out ; well may the <unk> windows lose their colour and admit no light of day into the place ; well may the <unk> from the streets , who peep in through the glass <unk> in the door , be <unk> from entrance by its <unk> aspect and by the <unk> , languidly echoing to the roof from the <unk> <unk> where the Lord High Chancellor looks into the lantern that has no light in it and where the attendant wigs are all <unk> in a <unk> !
This is the Court of Chancery , which has its decaying houses and its blighted <unk> in every <unk> , which has its <unk> <unk> in every <unk> and its dead in every churchyard , which has its ruined suitor with his <unk> heels and threadbare dress <unk> and begging through the round of every man ’ s acquaintance , which gives to <unk> might the means <unk> of <unk> out the right , which so <unk> <unk> , patience , courage , hope , so <unk> the <unk> and breaks the heart , that there is not an honourable man among its practitioners who would not give — who does not often give — the warning , “ <unk> any wrong that can be done you rather than come here ! ” Who happen to be in the Lord Chancellor ’ s court this <unk> afternoon besides the Lord Chancellor , the counsel in the cause , two or three counsel who are never in any cause , and the well of solicitors before mentioned ?
There is the <unk> below the judge , in wig and gown ; and there are two or three <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> purses , or whatever they may be , in legal court suits .
These are all <unk> , for no <unk> of amusement ever falls from Jarndyce and Jarndyce ( the cause in hand ) , which was squeezed dry years upon years ago .
The <unk> writers , the <unk> of the court , and the <unk> of the newspapers invariably <unk> with the rest of the <unk> when Jarndyce and Jarndyce comes on .
Their places are a blank .
<unk> on a seat at the side of the hall , the better to <unk> into the <unk> sanctuary , is a little mad old woman in a squeezed bonnet who is always in court , from its sitting to its rising , and always expecting some <unk> judgment to be given in her favour .
Some say she really is , or was , a party to a suit , but no one knows for certain because no one cares .
She carries some small litter in a reticule which she calls her documents , principally <unk> of paper <unk> and dry <unk> .
A sallow prisoner has come up , in custody , for the <unk> time to make a personal application “ to <unk> himself of his contempt , ” which , being a solitary <unk> <unk> who has fallen into a state of <unk> about accounts of which it is not pretended that he had ever any knowledge , he is not at all likely ever to do .
In the meantime his prospects in life are ended .
Another ruined suitor , who <unk> appears from Shropshire and breaks out into efforts to address the Chancellor at the close of the day ’ s business and who can by no means be made to understand that the Chancellor is <unk> <unk> of his existence after making it desolate for a quarter of a century , plants himself in a good place and keeps an eye on the judge , ready to call out “ My Lord ! ” in a voice of <unk> complaint on the instant of his rising .
A few lawyers ’ clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger on the chance of his <unk> some <unk> and <unk> the dismal weather a little .
Jarndyce and Jarndyce <unk> on .
This <unk> of a suit has , in course of time , become so <unk> that no man alive knows what it means .
The parties to it understand it least , but it has been observed that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five minutes without coming to a total <unk> as to all the premises .
<unk> children have been born into the cause ; innumerable young people have married into it ; innumerable old people have died out of it .
<unk> of persons have <unk> found themselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce without knowing how or why ; whole families have inherited <unk> <unk> with the suit .
The little <unk> or <unk> who was promised a new <unk> when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled has grown up , possessed himself of a real horse , and <unk> away into the other world .
<unk> wards of court have faded into mothers and <unk> ; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone out ; the <unk> of bills in the suit have been <unk> into mere bills of <unk> ; there are not three <unk> left upon the earth perhaps since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a <unk> in Chancery Lane ; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still <unk> its dreary length before the court , <unk> hopeless .
Jarndyce and Jarndyce has passed into a joke .
That is the only good that has ever come of it .
It has been death to many , but it is a joke in the profession .
Every master in Chancery has had a reference out of it .
Every Chancellor was “ in it , ” for somebody or other , when he was counsel at the bar .
Good things have been said about it by <unk> , <unk> old <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> after dinner in hall .
<unk> clerks have been in the habit of <unk> their legal wit upon it .
The last Lord Chancellor <unk> it neatly , when , correcting Mr. <unk> , the eminent silk gown who said that such a thing might happen when the sky rained potatoes , he observed , “ or when we get through Jarndyce and Jarndyce , Mr. <unk> ” — a <unk> that particularly <unk> the <unk> , bags , and purses .
How many people out of the suit Jarndyce and Jarndyce has stretched forth its unwholesome hand to spoil and <unk> would be a very wide question .
From the master upon whose <unk> <unk> <unk> of dusty <unk> in Jarndyce and Jarndyce have grimly <unk> into many shapes , down to the <unk> in the Six <unk> ’ Office who has copied his tens of thousands of Chancery <unk> under that eternal <unk> , no man ’ s nature has been made better by it .
In <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , under false <unk> of all sorts , there are influences that can never come to good .
The very solicitors ’ boys who have kept the wretched suitors at <unk> , by protesting time out of mind that Mr. <unk> , <unk> , or otherwise was particularly engaged and had <unk> until dinner , may have got an extra moral twist and shuffle into themselves out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
The <unk> in the cause has acquired a goodly sum of money by it but has acquired too a distrust of his own mother and a contempt for his own kind .
<unk> , <unk> , and otherwise have <unk> into a habit of <unk> promising themselves that they will look into that <unk> little matter and see what can be done for <unk> — who was not well used — when Jarndyce and Jarndyce shall be got out of the office .
<unk> and <unk> in all their many <unk> have been <unk> <unk> by the ill-fated cause ; and even those who have contemplated its history from the <unk> circle of such evil have been <unk> tempted into a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad course , and a loose belief that if the world go wrong it was in some off-hand manner never meant to go right .
Thus , in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog , sits the Lord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery .
“ Mr.
Tangle , ” says the Lord High Chancellor , <unk> something restless under the eloquence of that learned gentleman .
“ <unk> , ” says Mr. Tangle .
Mr. Tangle knows more of Jarndyce and Jarndyce than anybody .
He is famous for it — supposed never to have read anything else since he left school .
“ Have you nearly concluded your argument ? ” “ <unk> , no — variety of points — feel it my duty <unk> — <unk> , ” is the reply that <unk> out of Mr. Tangle .
“ Several members of the bar are still to be heard , I believe ? ” says the Chancellor with a slight smile .
<unk> of Mr. Tangle ’ s learned friends , each <unk> with a little <unk> of eighteen hundred sheets , <unk> up like eighteen <unk> in a <unk> , make eighteen bows , and drop into their eighteen places of <unk> .
“ We will proceed with the hearing on Wednesday fortnight , ” says the Chancellor .
For the question at <unk> is only a question of costs , a mere <unk> on the <unk> tree of the parent suit , and really will come to a settlement one of these days .
The Chancellor rises ; the bar rises ; the prisoner is brought forward in a hurry ; the man from Shropshire cries , “ My lord ! ” <unk> , bags , and purses indignantly <unk> silence and frown at the man from Shropshire .
“ In reference , ” proceeds the Chancellor , still on Jarndyce and Jarndyce , “ to the young girl — ” “ <unk> ’ s pardon — boy , ” says Mr. Tangle <unk> .
“ In reference , ” proceeds the Chancellor with extra distinctness , “ to the young girl and boy , the two young people ” — Mr.
Tangle crushed — “ whom I directed to be in attendance to-day and who are now in my private room , I will see them and satisfy myself as to the <unk> of making the order for their residing with their uncle . ” Mr. Tangle on his legs again .
“ <unk> ’ s pardon — dead . ” “ With their ” — Chancellor looking through his double eye-glass at the papers on his desk — “ grandfather . ” “ <unk> ’ s pardon — victim of rash action — brains . ” <unk> a very little counsel with a terrific <unk> voice arises , fully <unk> , in the back <unk> of the fog , and says , “ Will your lordship allow me ?
I appear for him .
He is a cousin , several times removed .
I am not at the moment prepared to inform the court in what exact remove he is a cousin , but he IS a cousin . ” Leaving this address ( delivered like a <unk> message ) ringing in the <unk> of the roof , the very little counsel drops , and the fog knows him no more .
Everybody looks for him .
Nobody can see him .
“ I will speak with both the young people , ” says the Chancellor anew , “ and satisfy myself on the subject of their residing with their cousin .
I will mention the matter to-morrow morning when I take my seat . ” The Chancellor is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is presented .
Nothing can possibly come of the prisoner ’ s <unk> but his being sent back to prison , which is soon done .
The man from Shropshire ventures another <unk> “ My lord ! ” but the Chancellor , being aware of him , has <unk> <unk> .
Everybody else quickly <unk> too .
A <unk> of blue bags is <unk> with heavy charges of papers and carried off by clerks ; the little mad old woman marches off with her documents ; the empty court is locked up .
If all the injustice it has committed and all the misery it has caused could only be locked up with it , and the whole burnt away in a great funeral <unk> — why so much the better for other parties than the parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce !
CHAPTER <unk> In <unk> It is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that we want on this same <unk> afternoon .
It is not so unlike the Court of Chancery but that we may pass from the one scene to the other , as the crow flies .
Both the world of fashion and the Court of Chancery are things of <unk> and <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who have played at strange games through a deal of <unk> weather ; sleeping <unk> whom the <unk> will wake one day , when all the stopped spits in the kitchen shall begin to turn <unk> !
It is not a large world .
<unk> even to this world of ours , which has its limits too ( as your Highness shall find when you have made the <unk> of it and are come to the <unk> of the void beyond ) , it is a very little speck .
There is much good in it ; there are many good and true people in it ; it has its appointed place .
But the evil of it is that it is a world wrapped up in too much <unk> ’ s <unk> and fine <unk> , and cannot hear the rushing of the larger <unk> , and cannot see them as they circle round the sun .
It is a <unk> world , and its growth is sometimes <unk> for want of air .
My Lady Dedlock has returned to her house in town for a few days previous to her departure for Paris , where her ladyship <unk> to stay some weeks , after which her movements are uncertain .
The fashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the <unk> , and it knows all fashionable things .
To know things otherwise were to be <unk> .
My Lady Dedlock has been down at what she calls , in familiar conversation , her “ place ” in Lincolnshire .
The waters are out in Lincolnshire .
An arch of the bridge in the park has been <unk> and <unk> away .
The <unk> <unk> ground for half a mile in breadth is a stagnant river with melancholy trees for <unk> in it and a surface <unk> all over , all day long , with falling rain .
My Lady Dedlock ’ s place has been extremely dreary .
The weather for many a day and night has been so wet that the trees seem wet through , and the soft <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> ’ s <unk> can make no crash or <unk> as they fall .
The <unk> , looking <unk> , leave <unk> where they pass .
The shot of a <unk> <unk> its <unk> in the <unk> air , and its smoke moves in a <unk> little cloud towards the green rise , <unk> , that makes a <unk> for the falling rain .
The view from my Lady Dedlock ’ s own windows is <unk> a <unk> view and a view in <unk> ink .
The <unk> on the stone terrace in the <unk> catch the rain all day ; and the heavy drops fall — drip , drip , drip — upon the broad <unk> pavement , called from old time the Ghost ’ s Walk , all night .
On Sundays the little church in the park is <unk> ; the <unk> <unk> breaks out into a cold <unk> ; and there is a general smell and taste as of the ancient Dedlocks in their graves .
My Lady Dedlock ( who is <unk> ) , looking out in the early twilight from her <unk> at a keeper ’ s lodge and seeing the light of a fire upon the <unk> <unk> , and smoke rising from the chimney , and a child , <unk> by a woman , running out into the rain to meet the shining figure of a <unk> man coming through the gate , has been put quite out of temper .
My Lady Dedlock says she has been “ bored to death . ” Therefore my Lady Dedlock has come away from the place in Lincolnshire and has left it to the rain , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> and <unk> .
The pictures of the Dedlocks past and gone have seemed to <unk> into the damp walls in mere <unk> of spirits , as the housekeeper has passed along the old rooms shutting up the shutters .
And when they will next come forth again , the fashionable intelligence — which , like the <unk> , is <unk> of the past and present , but not the future — cannot yet undertake to say .
Sir Leicester Dedlock is only a baronet , but there is no <unk> baronet than he .
His family is as old as the hills , and infinitely more respectable .
He has a general opinion that the world might get on without hills but would be done up without Dedlocks .
He would on the whole admit nature to be a good idea ( a little low , perhaps , when not enclosed with a <unk> ) , but an idea dependent for its <unk> on your great county families .
He is a gentleman of strict conscience , disdainful of all <unk> and meanness and ready on the <unk> notice to die any death you may please to mention rather than give occasion for the least <unk> of his <unk> .
He is an honourable , obstinate , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , perfectly unreasonable man .
Sir Leicester is twenty years , full measure , older than my Lady .
He will never see <unk> again , nor perhaps <unk> , nor yet <unk> .
He has a twist of the gout now and then and walks a little <unk> .
He is of a worthy presence , with his <unk> hair and whiskers , his fine <unk> , his <unk> waistcoat , and his blue coat with bright buttons always buttoned .
He is <unk> , stately , most polite on every occasion to my Lady , and holds her personal attractions in the highest <unk> .
His gallantry to my Lady , which has never changed since he <unk> her , is the one little touch of romantic fancy in him .
Indeed , he married her for love .
A whisper still goes about that she had not even family ; <unk> , Sir Leicester had so much family that perhaps he had enough and could dispense with any more .
But she had beauty , pride , ambition , <unk> resolve , and sense enough to portion out a <unk> of fine ladies .
<unk> and station , added to these , soon <unk> her upward , and for years now my Lady Dedlock has been at the centre of the fashionable intelligence and at the top of the fashionable tree .
How <unk> wept when he had no more <unk> to conquer , everybody knows — or has some reason to know by this time , the matter having been rather frequently mentioned .
My Lady Dedlock , having <unk> HER world , fell not into the melting , but rather into the <unk> , <unk> .
An exhausted composure , a <unk> <unk> , an <unk> of fatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction , are the <unk> of her <unk> .
She is perfectly <unk> .
If she could be <unk> to heaven to-morrow , she might be expected to <unk> without any rapture .
She has beauty still , and if it be not in its <unk> , it is not yet in its autumn .
She has a fine face — originally of a character that would be rather called very pretty than handsome , but improved into <unk> by the acquired expression of her fashionable state .
Her figure is elegant and has the effect of being tall .
Not that she is so , but that “ the most is made , ” as the Honourable Bob Stables has frequently <unk> upon oath , “ of all her points . ” The same authority observes that she is perfectly got up and remarks in <unk> of her hair especially that she is the <unk> woman in the whole <unk> .
With all her <unk> on her head , my Lady Dedlock has come up from her place in Lincolnshire ( <unk> pursued by the fashionable intelligence ) to pass a few days at her house in town previous to her departure for Paris , where her ladyship <unk> to stay some weeks , after which her movements are uncertain .
And at her house in town , upon this muddy , <unk> afternoon , presents himself an old-fashioned old gentleman , <unk> and <unk> solicitor of the High Court of Chancery , who has the honour of <unk> as legal adviser of the Dedlocks and has as many <unk> boxes in his office with that name outside as if the present baronet were the <unk> of the <unk> ’ s <unk> and were constantly being <unk> through the whole set .
<unk> the hall , and up the stairs , and along the passages , and through the rooms , which are very brilliant in the season and very dismal out of it — <unk> to visit , but a desert to live in — the old gentleman is conducted by a Mercury in powder to my Lady ’ s presence .
The old gentleman is rusty to look at , but is <unk> to have made good <unk> out of aristocratic marriage <unk> and aristocratic wills , and to be very rich .
He is surrounded by a mysterious <unk> of family <unk> , of which he is known to be the silent <unk> .
There are noble <unk> rooted for centuries in retired <unk> of <unk> among the growing timber and the fern , which perhaps hold <unk> noble secrets than walk abroad among men , shut up in the breast of Mr. Tulkinghorn .
He is of what is called the old school — a phrase generally meaning any school that seems never to have been young — and wears <unk> tied with <unk> , and <unk> or stockings .
One <unk> of his black clothes and of his black stockings , be they silk or <unk> , is that they never shine .
<unk> , close , <unk> to any glancing light , his dress is like himself .
He never <unk> when not professionally <unk> .
He is found sometimes , speechless but quite at home , at corners of <unk> in great country houses and near doors of <unk> , concerning which the fashionable intelligence is eloquent , where everybody knows him and where half the <unk> stops to say “ How do you do , Mr. Tulkinghorn ? ” He receives these <unk> with gravity and <unk> them along with the rest of his knowledge .
Sir Leicester Dedlock is with my Lady and is happy to see Mr. Tulkinghorn .
There is an air of <unk> about him which is always agreeable to Sir Leicester ; he receives it as a kind of tribute .
He likes Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s dress ; there is a kind of tribute in that too .
It is eminently respectable , and likewise , in a general way , <unk> .
It expresses , as it were , the steward of the legal mysteries , the <unk> of the legal cellar , of the Dedlocks .
Has Mr. Tulkinghorn any idea of this himself ?
It may be so , or it may not , but there is this remarkable circumstance to be <unk> in everything associated with my Lady Dedlock as one of a class — as one of the <unk> and <unk> of her little world .
She supposes herself to be an <unk> Being , quite out of the reach and <unk> of ordinary <unk> — seeing herself in her glass , where indeed she looks so .
Yet every dim little star revolving about her , from her maid to the <unk> of the Italian <unk> , knows her weaknesses , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> and lives upon as <unk> a calculation and as nice a measure of her moral nature as her <unk> takes of her physical proportions .
Is a new dress , a new custom , a new <unk> , a new <unk> , a new form of <unk> , a new <unk> or giant , a new <unk> , a new anything , to be set up ?
There are deferential people in a dozen <unk> whom my Lady Dedlock suspects of nothing but <unk> before her , who can tell you how to manage her as if she were a baby , who do nothing but nurse her all their lives , who , <unk> affecting to follow with profound <unk> , lead her and her whole <unk> after them ; who , in <unk> one , hook all and bear them off as <unk> <unk> bore away the stately <unk> of the majestic <unk> .
“ If you want to address our people , sir , ” say <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> — meaning by our people Lady Dedlock and the rest — “ you must remember that you are not dealing with the general public ; you must <unk> our people in their <unk> place , and their <unk> place is such a place . ” “ To make this article go down , gentlemen , ” say Sheen and Gloss , the <unk> , to their friends the <unk> , “ you must come to us , because we know where to have the fashionable people , and we can make it fashionable . ” “ If you want to get this print upon the tables of my high connexion , sir , ” says Mr. Sladdery , the <unk> , “ or if you want to get this <unk> or giant into the houses of my high connexion , sir , or if you want to <unk> to this entertainment the patronage of my high connexion , sir , you must leave it , if you please , to me , for I have been accustomed to study the <unk> of my high connexion , sir , and I may tell you without <unk> that I can turn them round my finger ” — in which Mr. Sladdery , who is an honest man , does not <unk> at all .
Therefore , while Mr. Tulkinghorn may not know what is passing in the Dedlock mind at present , it is very possible that he may .
“ My Lady ’ s cause has been again before the Chancellor , has it , Mr. Tulkinghorn ? ” says Sir Leicester , giving him his hand .
“ Yes .
It has been on again to-day , ” Mr. Tulkinghorn replies , making one of his quiet bows to my Lady , who is on a sofa near the fire , shading her face with a <unk> .
“ It would be useless to ask , ” says my Lady with the <unk> of the place in Lincolnshire still upon her , “ whether anything has been done . ” “ Nothing that YOU would call anything has been done to-day , ” replies Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ Nor ever will be , ” says my Lady .
Sir Leicester has no objection to an <unk> Chancery suit .
It is a slow , expensive , British , <unk> kind of thing .
To be sure , he has not a <unk> interest in the suit in question , her part in which was the only property my Lady brought him ; and he has a shadowy impression that for his name — the name of Dedlock — to be in a cause , and not in the title of that cause , is a most ridiculous accident .
But he regards the Court of Chancery , even if it should involve an occasional delay of justice and a trifling amount of confusion , as a something <unk> in <unk> with a variety of other <unk> by the perfection of human wisdom for the eternal settlement ( <unk> speaking ) of everything .
And he is upon the whole of a fixed opinion that to give the <unk> of his countenance to any <unk> respecting it would be to encourage some person in the lower classes to rise up somewhere — like Wat Tyler .
“ As a few fresh affidavits have been put upon the file , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “ and as they are short , and as I proceed upon the troublesome principle of begging leave to possess my clients with any new proceedings in a cause ” — <unk> man Mr. Tulkinghorn , taking no more responsibility than necessary — “ and further , as I see you are going to Paris , I have brought them in my pocket . ” ( Sir Leicester was going to Paris too , by the by , but the delight of the fashionable intelligence was in his Lady . )
Mr. Tulkinghorn takes out his papers , asks permission to place them on a golden <unk> of a table at my Lady ’ s elbow , puts on his spectacles , and begins to read by the light of a shaded lamp .
“ ‘ In Chancery .
Between John Jarndyce — ’ ” My Lady interrupts , <unk> him to miss as many of the formal horrors as he can .
Mr. Tulkinghorn glances over his spectacles and begins again lower down .
My Lady carelessly and <unk> <unk> her attention .
Sir Leicester in a great chair looks at the file and appears to have a stately liking for the legal <unk> and <unk> as <unk> among the national <unk> .
It happens that the fire is hot where my Lady sits and that the <unk> is more beautiful than useful , being <unk> but small .
My Lady , changing her position , sees the papers on the table — looks at them nearer — looks at them nearer still — asks <unk> , “ Who copied that ? ” Mr. Tulkinghorn stops short , surprised by my Lady ’ s animation and her unusual tone .
“ Is it what you people call <unk> ? ” she asks , looking full at him in her careless way again and <unk> with her screen .
“ Not quite .
Probably ” — Mr.
Tulkinghorn examines it as he speaks — “ the legal character which it has was acquired after the original hand was formed .
Why do you ask ? ” “ Anything to <unk> this <unk> <unk> .
Oh , go on , do ! ” Mr. Tulkinghorn reads again .
The heat is greater ; my Lady screens her face .
Sir Leicester <unk> , starts up suddenly , and cries , “ Eh ?
What do you say ? ” “ I say I am afraid , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , who had risen hastily , “ that Lady Dedlock is ill . ” “ <unk> , ” my Lady murmurs with white lips , “ only that ; but it is like the <unk> of death .
Don ’ t speak to me .
<unk> , and take me to my room ! ” Mr. Tulkinghorn retires into another chamber ; bells ring , feet shuffle and <unk> , silence <unk> .
Mercury at last begs Mr. Tulkinghorn to return .
“ Better now , ” quoth Sir Leicester , <unk> the lawyer to sit down and read to him alone .
“ I have been quite alarmed .
I never knew my Lady <unk> before .
But the weather is extremely trying , and she really has been bored to death down at our place in Lincolnshire . ” CHAPTER <unk> A <unk> I have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write my portion of these pages , for I know I am not clever .
I always knew that .
I can remember , when I was a very little girl indeed , I used to say to my doll when we were alone together , “ Now , Dolly , I am not clever , you know very well , and you must be patient with me , like a dear ! ” And so she used to sit <unk> up in a great arm-chair , with her beautiful complexion and rosy lips , staring at me — or not so much at me , I think , as at nothing — while I busily <unk> away and told her every one of my secrets .
My dear old doll !
I was such a shy little thing that I seldom dared to open my lips , and never dared to open my heart , to anybody else .
It almost makes me cry to think what a relief it used to be to me when I came home from school of a day to run upstairs to my room and say , “ Oh , you dear faithful Dolly , I knew you would be expecting me ! ” and then to sit down on the floor , leaning on the elbow of her great chair , and tell her all I had noticed since we parted .
I had always rather a noticing way — not a quick way , oh , no ! — a silent way of noticing what passed before me and thinking I should like to understand it better .
I have not by any means a quick understanding .
When I love a person very tenderly indeed , it seems to brighten .
But even that may be my <unk> .
I was brought up , from my <unk> remembrance — like some of the <unk> in the fairy stories , only I was not charming — by my godmother .
At least , I only knew her as such .
She was a good , good woman !
She went to church three times every Sunday , and to morning prayers on <unk> and <unk> , and to lectures whenever there were lectures ; and never missed .
She was handsome ; and if she had ever smiled , would have been ( I used to think ) like an angel — but she never smiled .
She was always grave and strict .
She was so very good herself , I thought , that the <unk> of other people made her frown all her life .
I felt so different from her , even making every allowance for the <unk> between a child and a woman ; I felt so poor , so trifling , and so far off that I never could be <unk> with her — no , could never even love her as I wished .
It made me very sorry to consider how good she was and how <unk> of her I was , and I used <unk> to hope that I might have a better heart ; and I talked it over very often with the dear old doll , but I never loved my godmother as I ought to have loved her and as I felt I must have loved her if I had been a better girl .
This made me , I dare say , more timid and retiring than I naturally was and cast me upon Dolly as the only friend with whom I felt at ease .
But something happened when I was still quite a little thing that helped it very much .
I had never heard my mama spoken of .
I had never heard of my papa either , but I felt more interested about my mama .
I had never worn a black frock , that I could recollect .
I had never been shown my mama ’ s grave .
I had never been told where it was .
Yet I had never been taught to pray for any relation but my godmother .
I had more than once approached this subject of my thoughts with Mrs. Rachael , our only servant , who took my light away when I was in bed ( another very good woman , but <unk> to me ) , and she had only said , “ Esther , good night ! ” and gone away and left me .
Although there were seven girls at the neighbouring school where I was a day <unk> , and although they called me little Esther Summerson , I knew none of them at home .
All of them were older than I , to be sure ( I was the youngest there by a good deal ) , but there seemed to be some other separation between us besides that , and besides their being far more clever than I was and knowing much more than I did .
One of them in the first week of my going to the school ( I remember it very well ) invited me home to a little party , to my great joy .
But my godmother wrote a stiff letter <unk> for me , and I never went .
I never went out at all .
It was my birthday .
There were <unk> at school on other <unk> — none on mine .
There were <unk> at home on other <unk> , as I knew from what I heard the girls relate to one another — there were none on mine .
My birthday was the most melancholy day at home in the whole year .
I have mentioned that unless my <unk> should deceive me ( as I know it may , for I may be very vain without <unk> it , though indeed I don ’ t ) , my comprehension is quickened when my affection is .
My disposition is very affectionate , and perhaps I might still feel such a wound if such a wound could be received more than once with the quickness of that birthday .
<unk> was over , and my godmother and I were sitting at the table before the fire .
The clock <unk> , the fire <unk> ; not another sound had been heard in the room or in the house for I don ’ t know how long .
I happened to look timidly up from my <unk> , across the table at my godmother , and I saw in her face , looking gloomily at me , “ It would have been far better , little Esther , that you had had no birthday , that you had never been born ! ” I broke out crying and sobbing , and I said , “ Oh , dear godmother , tell me , pray do tell me , did <unk> die on my birthday ? ” “ No , ” she returned .
“ Ask me no more , child ! ” “ Oh , do pray tell me something of her .
Do now , at last , dear godmother , if you please !
What did I do to her ?
How did I lose her ?
Why am I so different from other children , and why is it my fault , dear godmother ?
No , no , no , don ’ t go away .
Oh , speak to me ! ” I was in a kind of fright beyond my grief , and I caught hold of her dress and was <unk> to her .
She had been saying all the while , “ Let me go ! ” But now she stood still .
Her darkened face had such power over me that it stopped me in the midst of my vehemence .
I put up my trembling little hand to <unk> hers or to beg her pardon with what earnestness I might , but withdrew it as she looked at me , and laid it on my fluttering heart .
She raised me , sat in her chair , and standing me before her , said slowly in a cold , low voice — I see her <unk> brow and pointed finger — “ Your mother , Esther , is your disgrace , and you were hers .
The time will come — and soon enough — when you will understand this better and will feel it too , as no one save a woman can .
I have <unk> her ” — but her face did not <unk> — “ the wrong she did to me , and I say no more of it , though it was greater than you will ever know — than any one will ever know but I , the <unk> .
For yourself , unfortunate girl , <unk> and <unk> from the first of these evil <unk> , pray daily that the sins of others be not visited upon your head , according to what is written .
<unk> your mother and leave all other people to forget her who will do her unhappy child that greatest kindness .
Now , go ! ” She checked me , however , as I was about to depart from her — so frozen as I was ! — and added this , “ <unk> , <unk> , diligent work , are the preparations for a life begun with such a shadow on it .
You are different from other children , Esther , because you were not born , like them , in common <unk> and <unk> .
You are set apart . ” I went up to my room , and crept to bed , and laid my doll ’ s cheek against mine wet with tears , and holding that solitary friend upon my bosom , cried myself to sleep .
<unk> as my understanding of my sorrow was , I knew that I had brought no joy at any time to anybody ’ s heart and that I was to no one upon earth what Dolly was to me .
Dear , dear , to think how much time we passed alone together afterwards , and how often I repeated to the doll the story of my birthday and confided to her that I would try as hard as ever I could to repair the fault I had been born with ( of which I <unk> felt guilty and yet innocent ) and would <unk> as I grew up to be industrious , contented , and <unk> and to do some good to some one , and win some love to myself if I could .
I hope it is not <unk> to shed these tears as I think of it .
I am very thankful , I am very cheerful , but I cannot quite help their coming to my eyes .
There !
I have <unk> them away now and can go on again <unk> .
I felt the distance between my godmother and myself so much more after the birthday , and felt so sensible of filling a place in her house which ought to have been empty , that I found her more difficult of approach , though I was <unk> grateful to her in my heart , than ever .
I felt in the same way towards my school companions ; I felt in the same way towards Mrs. Rachael , who was a widow ; and oh , towards her daughter , of whom she was proud , who came to see her once a fortnight !
I was very retired and quiet , and tried to be very diligent .
One sunny afternoon when I had come home from school with my books and <unk> , watching my long shadow at my side , and as I was gliding upstairs to my room as usual , my godmother looked out of the <unk> and called me back .
<unk> with her , I found — which was very unusual indeed — a stranger .
A <unk> , <unk> gentleman , dressed all in black , with a white cravat , large gold watch <unk> , a pair of gold eye-glasses , and a large <unk> upon his little finger .
“ This , ” said my godmother in an <unk> , “ is the child . ” Then she said in her naturally stern way of speaking , “ This is Esther , sir . ” The gentleman put up his eye-glasses to look at me and said , “ Come here , my dear ! ” He shook hands with me and asked me to take off my bonnet , looking at me all the while .
When I had <unk> , he said , “ Ah ! ” and afterwards “ Yes ! ” And then , taking off his eye-glasses and folding them in a red case , and leaning back in his arm-chair , turning the case about in his two hands , he gave my godmother a nod .
Upon that , my godmother said , “ You may go upstairs , Esther ! ” And I made him my curtsy and left him .
It must have been two years afterwards , and I was almost <unk> , when one dreadful night my godmother and I sat at the fireside .
I was reading aloud , and she was listening .
I had come down at nine o ’ clock as I always did to read the <unk> to her , and was reading from St. John how our <unk> stooped down , writing with his finger in the dust , when they brought the <unk> woman to him .
“ So when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself and said unto them , ‘ He that is without <unk> among you , let him first cast a stone at her ! ’ ” I was stopped by my godmother ’ s rising , putting her hand to her head , and crying out in an awful voice from quite another part of the book , “ ‘ Watch ye , therefore , lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping .
And what I say unto you , I say unto all , Watch ! ’ ” In an instant , while she stood before me repeating these words , she fell down on the floor .
I had no need to cry out ; her voice had sounded through the house and been heard in the street .
She was laid upon her bed .
For more than a week she lay there , little altered outwardly , with her old handsome resolute frown that I so well knew <unk> upon her face .
Many and many a time , in the day and in the night , with my head upon the pillow by her that my whispers might be plainer to her , I kissed her , thanked her , prayed for her , asked her for her blessing and forgiveness , entreated her to give me the least sign that she knew or heard me .
No , no , no .
Her face was immovable .
To the very last , and even afterwards , her frown remained <unk> .
On the day after my poor good godmother was buried , the gentleman in black with the white <unk> <unk> .
I was sent for by Mrs. Rachael , and found him in the same place , as if he had never gone away .
“ My name is Kenge , ” he said ; “ you may remember it , my child ; Kenge and Carboy , Lincoln ’ s Inn . ” I replied that I remembered to have seen him once before .
“ Pray be seated — here near me .
Don ’ t distress yourself ; it ’ s of no use .
Mrs. Rachael , I needn ’ t inform you who were acquainted with the late Miss Barbary ’ s affairs , that her means die with her and that this young lady , now her aunt is dead — ” “ My aunt , sir ! ” “ It is really of no use carrying on a <unk> when no object is to be gained by it , ” said Mr. Kenge smoothly , “ <unk> in fact , though not in law .
Don ’ t distress yourself !
Don ’ t <unk> !
Don ’ t tremble !
Mrs. Rachael , our young friend has no doubt heard of — the — a — Jarndyce and Jarndyce . ” “ Never , ” said Mrs. Rachael .
“ Is it possible , ” pursued Mr. Kenge , putting up his eye-glasses , “ that our young friend — I <unk> you won ’ t distress yourself ! — never heard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce ! ” I shook my head , wondering even what it was .
“ Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce ? ” said Mr. Kenge , looking over his glasses at me and softly turning the case about and about as if he were <unk> something .
“ Not of one of the greatest Chancery suits known ?
Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce — the — a — in itself a monument of Chancery practice .
In which ( I would say ) every difficulty , every <unk> , every masterly fiction , every form of <unk> known in that court , is represented over and over again ?
It is a cause that could not <unk> out of this free and great country .
I should say that the <unk> of costs in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , Mrs. Rachael ” — I was afraid he addressed himself to her because I appeared <unk> — “ <unk> at the present hour to from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> ! ” said Mr. Kenge , leaning back in his chair .
I felt very <unk> , but what could I do ?
I was so entirely <unk> with the subject that I understood nothing about it even then .
“ And she really never heard of the cause ! ” said Mr. Kenge .
“ <unk> ! ” “ Miss Barbary , sir , ” returned Mrs. Rachael , “ who is now among the <unk> — ” “ I hope so , I am sure , ” said Mr. Kenge politely .
“ — <unk> Esther only to know what would be serviceable to her .
And she knows , from any teaching she has had here , nothing more . ” “ Well ! ” said Mr. Kenge .
“ Upon the whole , very proper .
Now to the point , ” addressing me .
“ Miss Barbary , your sole relation ( in fact that is , for I am bound to observe that in law you had none ) being deceased and it naturally not being to be expected that Mrs. Rachael — ” “ Oh , dear no ! ” said Mrs. Rachael quickly .
“ Quite so , ” assented Mr. Kenge ; “ — that Mrs. Rachael should charge herself with your <unk> and support ( I beg you won ’ t distress yourself ) , you are in a position to receive the <unk> of an offer which I was <unk> to make to Miss Barbary some two years ago and which , though <unk> then , was understood to be <unk> under the <unk> circumstances that have since occurred .
Now , if I <unk> that I represent , in Jarndyce and Jarndyce and otherwise , a highly <unk> , but at the same time singular , man , shall I compromise myself by any stretch of my professional caution ? ” said Mr. Kenge , leaning back in his chair again and looking calmly at us both .
He appeared to enjoy beyond everything the sound of his own voice .
I couldn ’ t wonder at that , for it was <unk> and full and gave great importance to every word he uttered .
He listened to himself with <unk> satisfaction and sometimes gently beat time to his own music with his head or <unk> a sentence with his hand .
I was very much impressed by him — even then , before I knew that he formed himself on the model of a great lord who was his client and that he was generally called Conversation Kenge .
“ Mr.
Jarndyce , ” he pursued , “ being aware of the — I would say , desolate — position of our young friend , offers to place her at a first-rate establishment where her education shall be completed , where her comfort shall be secured , where her reasonable wants shall be anticipated , where she shall be eminently <unk> to discharge her duty in that station of life unto which it has pleased — shall I say <unk> ? — to call her . ” My heart was filled so full , both by what he said and by his affecting manner of saying it , that I was not able to speak , though I tried .
“ Mr.
Jarndyce , ” he went on , “ makes no condition beyond expressing his expectation that our young friend will not at any time remove herself from the establishment in question without his knowledge and <unk> .
That she will faithfully apply herself to the <unk> of those <unk> , upon the exercise of which she will be <unk> dependent .
That she will tread in the <unk> of virtue and honour , and — the — a — — so forth . ” I was still less able to speak than before .
“ Now , what does our young friend say ? ” proceeded Mr. Kenge .
“ Take time , take time !
I pause for her reply .
But take time ! ” What the <unk> subject of such an offer tried to say , I need not repeat .
What she did say , I could more easily tell , if it were worth the telling .
What she felt , and will feel to her dying hour , I could never relate .
This interview took place at <unk> , where I had passed ( as far as I knew ) my whole life .
On that day week , <unk> provided with all <unk> , I left it , inside the <unk> , for Reading .
Mrs. Rachael was too good to feel any emotion at parting , but I was not so good , and wept bitterly .
I thought that I ought to have known her better after so many years and ought to have made myself enough of a favourite with her to make her sorry then .
When she gave me one cold parting kiss upon my forehead , like a <unk> from the stone porch — it was a very frosty day — I felt so miserable and <unk> that I clung to her and told her it was my fault , I knew , that she could say good-bye so easily !
“ No , Esther ! ” she returned .
“ It is your misfortune ! ” The coach was at the little <unk> — we had not come out until we heard the wheels — and thus I left her , with a sorrowful heart .
She went in before my boxes were lifted to the <unk> and shut the door .
As long as I could see the house , I looked back at it from the window through my tears .
My godmother had left Mrs. Rachael all the little property she possessed ; and there was to be a <unk> ; and an old <unk> with roses on it , which always seemed to me the first thing in the world I had ever seen , was hanging outside in the <unk> and snow .
A day or two before , I had wrapped the dear old doll in her own shawl and quietly laid her — I am half ashamed to tell it — in the <unk> under the tree that shaded my old window .
I had no companion left but my bird , and him I carried with me in his <unk> .
When the house was out of sight , I sat , with my <unk> in the straw at my feet , forward on the low seat to look out of the high window , watching the frosty trees , that were like beautiful pieces of <unk> , and the fields all smooth and white with last night ’ s snow , and the sun , so red but yielding so little heat , and the <unk> , dark like metal where the <unk> and <unk> had brushed the snow away .
There was a gentleman in the coach who sat on the opposite seat and looked very large in a quantity of <unk> , but he sat <unk> out of the other window and took no notice of me .
I thought of my dead godmother , of the night when I read to her , of her frowning so fixedly and sternly in her bed , of the strange place I was going to , of the people I should find there , and what they would be like , and what they would say to me , when a voice in the coach gave me a terrible start .
It said , “ What the <unk> are you crying for ? ” I was so frightened that I lost my voice and could only answer in a whisper , “ Me , sir ? ” For of course I knew it must have been the gentleman in the quantity of <unk> , though he was still looking out of his window .
“ Yes , you , ” he said , turning round .
“ I didn ’ t know I was crying , sir , ” I <unk> .
“ But you are ! ” said the gentleman .
“ Look here ! ” He came quite opposite to me from the other corner of the coach , brushed one of his large <unk> <unk> across my eyes ( but without hurting me ) , and showed me that it was wet .
“ There !
Now you know you are , ” he said .
“ Don ’ t you ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” I said .
“ And what are you crying for ? ” said the gentleman , “ Don ’ t you want to go there ? ” “ Where , sir ? ” “ Where ?
Why , wherever you are going , ” said the gentleman .
“ I am very glad to go there , sir , ” I answered .
“ Well , then !
Look glad ! ” said the gentleman .
I thought he was very strange , or at least that what I could see of him was very strange , for he was wrapped up to the chin , and his face was almost hidden in a fur cap with broad fur <unk> at the side of his head fastened under his chin ; but I was composed again , and not afraid of him .
So I told him that I thought I must have been crying because of my godmother ’ s death and because of Mrs. Rachael ’ s not being sorry to part with me .
“ <unk> Mrs. Rachael ! ” said the gentleman .
“ Let her fly away in a high wind on a <unk> ! ” I began to be really afraid of him now and looked at him with the greatest astonishment .
But I thought that he had pleasant eyes , although he kept on muttering to himself in an angry manner and calling Mrs. Rachael names .
After a little while he opened his outer <unk> , which appeared to me large enough to <unk> up the whole coach , and put his arm down into a deep pocket in the side .
“ Now , look here ! ” he said .
“ In this paper , ” which was <unk> folded , “ is a piece of the best <unk> that can be got for money — <unk> on the outside an <unk> thick , like fat on mutton chops .
Here ’ s a little <unk> ( a <unk> this is , both for size and quality ) , made in <unk> .
And what do you suppose it ’ s made of ?
<unk> of fat <unk> .
There ’ s a <unk> !
Now let ’ s see you eat ’ em . ” “ Thank you , sir , ” I replied ; “ thank you very much indeed , but I hope you won ’ t be offended — they are too rich for me . ” “ <unk> again ! ” said the gentleman , which I didn ’ t at all understand , and threw them both out of window .
He did not speak to me any more until he got out of the coach a little way short of Reading , when he advised me to be a good girl and to be <unk> , and shook hands with me .
I must say I was relieved by his departure .
We left him at a <unk> .
I often walked past it afterwards , and never for a long time without thinking of him and half expecting to meet him .
But I never did ; and so , as time went on , he passed out of my mind .
When the coach stopped , a very neat lady looked up at the window and said , “ Miss Donny . ” “ No , ma ’ am , Esther Summerson . ” “ That is quite right , ” said the lady , “ Miss Donny . ” I now understood that she <unk> herself by that name , and begged Miss Donny ’ s pardon for my mistake , and pointed out my boxes at her request .
Under the direction of a very neat maid , they were put outside a very small green carriage ; and then Miss Donny , the maid , and I got inside and were driven away .
“ Everything is ready for you , Esther , ” said Miss Donny , “ and the scheme of your pursuits has been arranged in exact <unk> with the wishes of your guardian , Mr. Jarndyce . ” “ Of — did you say , ma ’ am ? ” “ Of your guardian , Mr. Jarndyce , ” said Miss Donny .
I was so <unk> that Miss Donny thought the cold had been too severe for me and <unk> me her <unk> .
“ Do you know my — guardian , Mr. Jarndyce , ma ’ am ? ” I asked after a good deal of hesitation .
“ Not personally , Esther , ” said Miss Donny ; “ merely through his solicitors , Messrs. Kenge and Carboy , of London .
A very superior gentleman , Mr. Kenge .
Truly eloquent indeed .
Some of his periods quite majestic ! ” I felt this to be very true but was too confused to attend to it .
Our <unk> arrival at our destination , before I had time to recover myself , increased my confusion , and I never shall forget the uncertain and the <unk> air of everything at Greenleaf ( Miss Donny ’ s house ) that afternoon !
But I soon became used to it .
I was so adapted to the <unk> of Greenleaf before long that I seemed to have been there a great while and almost to have dreamed rather than really lived my old life at my godmother ’ s .
Nothing could be more <unk> , exact , and orderly than Greenleaf .
There was a time for everything all round the <unk> of the clock , and everything was done at its appointed moment .
We were twelve <unk> , and there were two Miss <unk> , <unk> .
It was understood that I would have to depend , by and by , on my <unk> as a <unk> , and I was not only <unk> in everything that was taught at Greenleaf , but was very soon engaged in helping to <unk> others .
Although I was treated in every other respect like the rest of the school , this single difference was made in my case from the first .
As I began to know more , I taught more , and so in course of time I had plenty to do , which I was very fond of doing because it made the dear girls fond of me .
At last , whenever a new pupil came who was a little <unk> and unhappy , she was so sure — indeed I don ’ t know why — to make a friend of me that all <unk> were confided to my care .
They said I was so gentle , but I am sure THEY were !
I often thought of the resolution I had made on my birthday to try to be industrious , contented , and <unk> and to do some good to some one and win some love if I could ; and indeed , indeed , I felt almost ashamed to have done so little and have won so much .
I passed at Greenleaf six happy , quiet years .
I never saw in any face there , thank heaven , on my birthday , that it would have been better if I had never been born .
When the day came round , it brought me so many tokens of affectionate remembrance that my room was beautiful with them from New <unk> ’ s Day to <unk> .
In those six years I had never been away except on visits at <unk> time in the neighbourhood .
After the first six months or so I had taken Miss Donny ’ s advice in reference to the <unk> of writing to Mr. Kenge to say that I was happy and grateful , and with her approval I had written such a letter .
I had received a formal answer <unk> its receipt and saying , “ We note the contents thereof , which shall be <unk> communicated to our client . ” After that I sometimes heard Miss Donny and her sister mention how regular my accounts were paid , and about twice a year I ventured to write a similar letter .
I always received by return of post exactly the same answer in the same round hand , with the <unk> of Kenge and Carboy in another writing , which I supposed to be Mr. Kenge ’ s .
It seems so curious to me to be obliged to write all this about myself !
As if this narrative were the narrative of MY life !
But my little body will soon fall into the <unk> now .
Six quiet years ( I find I am saying it for the second time ) I had passed at Greenleaf , seeing in those around me , as it might be in a <unk> , every stage of my own growth and change there , when , one November morning , I received this letter .
I <unk> the date .
Old Square , Lincoln ’ s Inn <unk> , Jarndyce and Jarndyce Our <unk> Mr. Jarndyce being <unk> to <unk> into his house , under an <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> in this cause , for whom he wishes to <unk> an <unk> <unk> , directs us to inform you that he will be glad of your <unk> in the <unk> capacity .
We have <unk> for your being <unk> , carriage free , <unk> eight o ’ clock coach from Reading , on <unk> morning next , to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , London , where one of our <unk> will be in waiting to <unk> you to our <unk> as above .
We are , <unk> , Your <unk> <unk> , Kenge and Carboy Miss Esther Summerson Oh , never , never , never shall I forget the emotion this letter caused in the house !
It was so tender in them to care so much for me , it was so gracious in that father who had not forgotten me to have made my orphan way so smooth and easy and to have inclined so many youthful <unk> towards me , that I could hardly bear it .
Not that I would have had them less sorry — I am afraid not ; but the pleasure of it , and the pain of it , and the pride and joy of it , and the humble regret of it were so <unk> that my heart seemed almost breaking while it was full of rapture .
The letter gave me only five days ’ notice of my removal .
When every minute added to the <unk> of love and kindness that were given me in those five days , and when at last the morning came and when they took me through all the rooms that I might see them for the last time , and when some cried , “ Esther , dear , say good-bye to me here at my bedside , where you first spoke so kindly to me ! ” and when others asked me only to write their names , “ With Esther ’ s love , ” and when they all surrounded me with their parting presents and clung to me weeping and cried , “ What shall we do when dear , dear Esther ’ s gone ! ” and when I tried to tell them how <unk> and how good they had all been to me and how I blessed and thanked them every one , what a heart I had !
And when the two Miss <unk> grieved as much to part with me as the least among them , and when the <unk> said , “ Bless you , miss , wherever you go ! ” and when the ugly lame old gardener , who I thought had hardly noticed me in all those years , came panting after the coach to give me a little nosegay of <unk> and told me I had been the light of his eyes — indeed the old man said so ! — what a heart I had then !
And could I help it if with all this , and the coming to the little school , and the unexpected sight of the poor children outside waving their <unk> and bonnets to me , and of a <unk> gentleman and lady whose daughter I had helped to teach and at whose house I had visited ( who were said to be the <unk> people in all that country ) , <unk> for nothing but calling out , “ Good-bye , Esther .
May you be very happy ! ” — could I help it if I was quite bowed down in the coach by myself and said “ Oh , I am so thankful , I am so thankful ! ” many times over !
But of course I soon considered that I must not take tears where I was going after all that had been done for me .
Therefore , of course , I made myself sob less and persuaded myself to be quiet by saying very often , “ Esther , now you really must !
This WILL NOT do ! ” I <unk> myself up pretty well at last , though I am afraid I was longer about it than I ought to have been ; and when I had <unk> my eyes with <unk> water , it was time to watch for London .
I was quite persuaded that we were there when we were ten miles off , and when we really were there , that we should never get there .
However , when we began to <unk> upon a stone pavement , and particularly when every other <unk> seemed to be running into us , and we seemed to be running into every other <unk> , I began to believe that we really were approaching the end of our journey .
Very soon afterwards we stopped .
A young gentleman who had <unk> himself by accident addressed me from the pavement and said , “ I am from Kenge and Carboy ’ s , miss , of Lincoln ’ s Inn . ” “ If you please , sir , ” said I.
He was very obliging , and as he handed me into a fly after <unk> the removal of my boxes , I asked him whether there was a great fire anywhere ?
For the streets were so full of dense brown smoke that scarcely anything was to be seen .
“ Oh , dear no , miss , ” he said .
“ This is a London particular . ” I had never heard of such a thing .
“ A fog , miss , ” said the young gentleman .
“ Oh , indeed ! ” said I.
We drove slowly through the <unk> and <unk> streets that ever were seen in the world ( I thought ) and in such a <unk> state of confusion that I wondered how the people kept their senses , until we passed into sudden <unk> under an old gateway and drove on through a silent square until we came to an odd <unk> in a corner , where there was an entrance up a <unk> , broad flight of stairs , like an entrance to a church .
And there really was a churchyard outside under some <unk> , for I saw the <unk> from the staircase window .
This was Kenge and Carboy ’ s .
The young gentleman showed me through an outer office into Mr. Kenge ’ s room — there was no one in it — and politely put an arm-chair for me by the fire .
He then called my attention to a little <unk> hanging from a <unk> on one side of the chimney-piece .
“ In case you should wish to look at yourself , miss , after the journey , as you ’ re going before the Chancellor .
Not that it ’ s <unk> , I am sure , ” said the young gentleman <unk> .
“ Going before the Chancellor ? ” I said , startled for a moment .
“ Only a matter of form , miss , ” returned the young gentleman .
“ Mr.
Kenge is in court now .
He left his compliments , and would you partake of some refreshment ” — there were <unk> and a <unk> of wine on a small table — “ and look over the paper , ” which the young gentleman gave me as he spoke .
He then stirred the fire and left me .
Everything was so strange — the stranger from its being night in the <unk> , the candles burning with a white <unk> , and looking raw and cold — that I read the words in the newspaper without knowing what they meant and found myself reading the same words repeatedly .
As it was of no use going on in that way , I put the paper down , took a peep at my bonnet in the glass to see if it was neat , and looked at the room , which was not half lighted , and at the shabby , dusty tables , and at the piles of <unk> , and at a <unk> full of the most <unk> books that ever had anything to say for themselves .
Then I went on , thinking , thinking , thinking ; and the fire went on , burning , burning , burning ; and the candles went on <unk> and <unk> , and there were no <unk> — until the young gentleman by and by brought a very dirty pair — for two hours .
At last Mr. Kenge came .
HE was not altered , but he was surprised to see how altered I was and appeared quite pleased .
“ As you are going to be the companion of the young lady who is now in the Chancellor ’ s private room , Miss Summerson , ” he said , “ we thought it well that you should be in attendance also .
You will not be <unk> by the Lord Chancellor , I dare say ? ” “ No , sir , ” I said , “ I don ’ t think I shall , ” really not seeing on consideration why I should be .
So Mr. Kenge gave me his arm and we went round the corner , under a <unk> , and in at a side door .
And so we came , along a passage , into a comfortable sort of room where a young lady and a young gentleman were standing near a great , <unk> fire .
A screen was interposed between them and it , and they were leaning on the screen , talking .
They both looked up when I came in , and I saw in the young lady , with the fire shining upon her , such a beautiful girl !
With such rich golden hair , such soft blue eyes , and such a bright , innocent , trusting face !
“ Miss Ada , ” said Mr. Kenge , “ this is Miss Summerson . ” She came to meet me with a smile of welcome and her hand extended , but seemed to change her mind in a moment and kissed me .
In short , she had such a natural , captivating , <unk> manner that in a few minutes we were sitting in the window-seat , with the light of the fire upon us , talking together as free and happy as could be .
What a load off my mind !
It was so delightful to know that she could confide in me and like me !
It was so good of her , and so encouraging to me !
The young gentleman was her distant cousin , she told me , and his name Richard Carstone .
He was a handsome youth with an ingenuous face and a most engaging laugh ; and after she had called him up to where we sat , he stood by us , in the light of the fire , talking gaily , like a light-hearted boy .
He was very young , not more than <unk> then , if quite so much , but nearly two years older than she was .
They were both <unk> and ( what was very unexpected and curious to me ) had never met before that day .
Our all three coming together for the first time in such an unusual place was a thing to talk about , and we talked about it ; and the fire , which had left off <unk> , <unk> its red eyes at us — as Richard said — like a drowsy old Chancery <unk> .
We <unk> in a low tone because a <unk> gentleman in a bag wig frequently came in and out , and when he did so , we could hear a <unk> sound in the distance , which he said was one of the counsel in our case addressing the Lord Chancellor .
He told Mr. Kenge that the Chancellor would be up in five minutes ; and presently we heard a bustle and a tread of feet , and Mr. Kenge said that the Court had risen and his lordship was in the next room .
The gentleman in the bag wig opened the door almost directly and requested Mr. Kenge to come in .
Upon that , we all went into the next room , Mr. Kenge first , with my darling — it is so natural to me now that I can ’ t help writing it ; and there , plainly dressed in black and sitting in an arm-chair at a table near the fire , was his lordship , whose <unk> , <unk> with beautiful gold <unk> , was thrown upon another chair .
He gave us a searching look as we entered , but his manner was both courtly and kind .
The gentleman in the bag wig laid bundles of papers on his lordship ’ s table , and his lordship silently <unk> one and turned over the leaves .
“ Miss Clare , ” said the Lord Chancellor .
“ Miss Ada Clare ? ” Mr. Kenge presented her , and his lordship begged her to sit down near him .
That he admired her and was interested by her even I could see in a moment .
It touched me that the home of such a beautiful young creature should be represented by that dry , official place .
The Lord High Chancellor , at his best , appeared so poor a <unk> for the love and pride of parents .
“ The Jarndyce in question , ” said the Lord Chancellor , still turning over leaves , “ is Jarndyce of Bleak House . ” “ Jarndyce of Bleak House , my lord , ” said Mr. Kenge .
“ A dreary name , ” said the Lord Chancellor .
“ But not a dreary place at present , my lord , ” said Mr. Kenge .
“ And Bleak House , ” said his lordship , “ is in — ” “ <unk> , my lord . ” “ Mr.
Jarndyce of Bleak House is not married ? ” said his lordship .
“ He is not , my lord , ” said Mr. Kenge .
A pause .
“ Young Mr. Richard Carstone is present ? ” said the Lord Chancellor , glancing towards him .
Richard bowed and <unk> forward .
“ Hum ! ” said the Lord Chancellor , turning over more leaves .
“ Mr.
Jarndyce of Bleak House , my lord , ” Mr. Kenge observed in a low voice , “ if I may venture to remind your lordship , <unk> a suitable companion for — ” “ For Mr. Richard Carstone ? ” I thought ( but I am not quite sure ) I heard his lordship say in an equally low voice and with a smile .
“ For Miss Ada Clare .
This is the young lady .
Miss Summerson . ” His lordship gave me an <unk> look and acknowledged my curtsy very <unk> .
“ Miss Summerson is not related to any party in the cause , I think ? ” “ No , my lord . ” Mr. Kenge <unk> over before it was quite said and whispered .
His lordship , with his eyes upon his papers , listened , nodded twice or <unk> , turned over more leaves , and did not look towards me again until we were going away .
Mr. Kenge now retired , and Richard with him , to where I was , near the door , leaving my pet ( it is so natural to me that again I can ’ t help it ! )
sitting near the Lord Chancellor , with whom his lordship spoke a little part , asking her , as she told me afterwards , whether she had well reflected on the proposed arrangement , and if she thought she would be happy under the roof of Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House , and why she thought so ?
Presently he rose <unk> and released her , and then he spoke for a minute or two with Richard Carstone , not seated , but standing , and altogether with more ease and less ceremony , as if he still knew , though he WAS Lord Chancellor , how to go straight to the candour of a boy .
“ Very well ! ” said his lordship aloud .
“ I shall make the order .
Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House has chosen , so far as I may judge , ” and this was when he looked at me , “ a very good companion for the young lady , and the arrangement altogether seems the best of which the circumstances admit . ” He dismissed us pleasantly , and we all went out , very much obliged to him for being so affable and polite , by which he had certainly lost no dignity but seemed to us to have gained some .
When we got under the <unk> , Mr. Kenge remembered that he must go back for a moment to ask a question and left us in the fog , with the Lord Chancellor ’ s carriage and servants waiting for him to come out .
“ Well ! ” said Richard Carstone .
“ THAT ’ S over !
And where do we go next , Miss Summerson ? ” “ Don ’ t you know ? ” I said .
“ Not in the least , ” said he .
“ And don ’ t YOU know , my love ? ” I asked Ada .
“ No ! ” said she .
“ Don ’ t you ? ” “ Not at all ! ” said I.
We looked at one another , half laughing at our being like the children in the wood , when a curious little old woman in a squeezed bonnet and carrying a reticule came <unk> and smiling up to us with an air of great ceremony .
“ Oh ! ” said she .
“ The wards in Jarndyce !
Ve-ry happy , I am sure , to have the honour !
It is a good omen for youth , and hope , and beauty when they find themselves in this place , and don ’ t know what ’ s to come of it . ” “ <unk> ! ” whispered Richard , not thinking she could hear him .
“ Right !
<unk> , young gentleman , ” she returned so quickly that he was quite abashed .
“ I was a ward myself .
I was not mad at that time , ” <unk> low and smiling between every little sentence .
“ I had youth and hope .
I believe , beauty .
It matters very little now .
Neither of the three served or saved me .
I have the honour to attend court regularly .
With my documents .
I expect a judgment .
<unk> .
On the Day of <unk> .
I have discovered that the <unk> seal mentioned in the <unk> is the Great Seal .
It has been open a long time !
Pray accept my blessing . ” As Ada was a little frightened , I said , to humour the poor old lady , that we were much obliged to her .
“ Ye-es ! ” she said <unk> .
“ I imagine so .
And here is Conversation Kenge .
With HIS documents !
How does your honourable <unk> do ? ” “ Quite well , quite well !
Now don ’ t be troublesome , that ’ s a good soul ! ” said Mr. Kenge , leading the way back .
“ By no means , ” said the poor old lady , keeping up with Ada and me .
“ Anything but troublesome .
I shall confer <unk> on both — which is not being troublesome , I trust ?
I expect a judgment .
<unk> .
On the Day of <unk> .
This is a good omen for you .
<unk> my blessing ! ” She stopped at the bottom of the <unk> , broad flight of stairs ; but we looked back as we went up , and she was still there , saying , still with a curtsy and a smile between every little sentence , “ <unk> .
And hope .
And beauty .
And Chancery .
And Conversation Kenge !
Ha !
Pray accept my blessing ! ” CHAPTER <unk> <unk> <unk> We were to pass the night , Mr. Kenge told us when we arrived in his room , at Mrs. Jellyby ’ s ; and then he turned to me and said he took it for granted I knew who Mrs. Jellyby was .
“ I really don ’ t , sir , ” I returned .
“ Perhaps Mr. Carstone — or Miss Clare — ” But no , they knew nothing whatever about Mrs. Jellyby .
“ <unk> !
Mrs. Jellyby , ” said Mr. Kenge , standing with his back to the fire and casting his eyes over the dusty <unk> as if it were Mrs. Jellyby ’ s <unk> , “ is a lady of very remarkable strength of character who <unk> herself entirely to the public .
She has devoted herself to an <unk> variety of public subjects at various times and is at present ( until something else <unk> her ) devoted to the subject of Africa , with a view to the general <unk> of the coffee <unk> — AND the natives — and the happy settlement , on the <unk> of the African <unk> , of our <unk> home <unk> .
Mr. Jarndyce , who is desirous to aid any work that is considered likely to be a good work and who is much sought after by <unk> , has , I believe , a very high opinion of Mrs. Jellyby . ” Mr. Kenge , adjusting his cravat , then looked at us .
“ And Mr. Jellyby , sir ? ” suggested Richard .
“ Ah !
Mr. Jellyby , ” said Mr. Kenge , “ is — a — I don ’ t know that I can describe him to you better than by saying that he is the husband of Mrs. Jellyby . ” “ A <unk> , sir ? ” said Richard with a droll look .
“ I don ’ t say that , ” returned Mr. Kenge gravely .
“ I can ’ t say that , indeed , for I know nothing whatever OF Mr. Jellyby .
I never , to my knowledge , had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Jellyby .
He may be a very superior man , but he is , so to speak , <unk> — <unk> — in the more shining qualities of his wife . ” Mr. Kenge proceeded to tell us that as the road to Bleak House would have been very long , dark , and <unk> on such an evening , and as we had been travelling already , Mr. Jarndyce had himself proposed this arrangement .
A carriage would be at Mrs. Jellyby ’ s to <unk> us out of town early in the <unk> of to-morrow .
He then rang a little bell , and the young gentleman came in .
<unk> him by the name of Guppy , Mr. Kenge inquired whether Miss Summerson ’ s boxes and the rest of the <unk> had been “ sent round . ” Mr. Guppy said yes , they had been sent round , and a coach was waiting to take us round too as soon as we pleased .
“ Then it only remains , ” said Mr. Kenge , shaking hands with us , “ for me to express my lively satisfaction in ( good day , Miss Clare ! )
the arrangement this day concluded and my ( <unk> to you , Miss Summerson ! )
lively hope that it will <unk> to the happiness , the ( glad to have had the honour of making your acquaintance , Mr.
Carstone ! )
welfare , the advantage in all points of view , of all concerned !
Guppy , see the party safely there . ” “ Where IS ‘ there , ’ Mr. Guppy ? ” said Richard as we went downstairs .
“ No distance , ” said Mr. Guppy ; “ round in Thavies Inn , you know . ” “ I can ’ t say I know where it is , for I come from <unk> and am strange in London . ” “ Only round the corner , ” said Mr. Guppy .
“ We just twist up Chancery Lane , and cut along Holborn , and there we are in four minutes ’ time , as near as a <unk> .
This is about a London particular <unk> , ain ’ t it , miss ? ” He seemed quite delighted with it on my account .
“ The fog is very dense indeed ! ” said I.
“ Not that it <unk> you , though , I ’ m sure , ” said Mr. Guppy , putting up the steps .
“ On the contrary , it seems to do you good , miss , judging from your appearance . ” I knew he meant well in paying me this compliment , so I laughed at myself for blushing at it when he had shut the door and got upon the box ; and we all three laughed and <unk> about our <unk> and the <unk> of London until we turned up under an archway to our destination — a narrow street of high houses like an <unk> <unk> to hold the fog .
There was a confused little crowd of people , principally children , gathered about the house at which we stopped , which had a <unk> <unk> plate on the door with the inscription <unk> .
“ Don ’ t be frightened ! ” said Mr. Guppy , looking in at the <unk> .
“ One of the young <unk> been and got his head through the area <unk> ! ” “ Oh , poor child , ” said I ; “ let me out , if you please ! ” “ Pray be careful of yourself , miss .
The young <unk> are always up to something , ” said Mr. Guppy .
I made my way to the poor child , who was one of the <unk> little <unk> I ever saw , and found him very hot and frightened and crying <unk> , fixed by the neck between two iron <unk> , while a <unk> and a beadle , with the <unk> intentions possible , were endeavouring to <unk> him back by the legs , under a general impression that his <unk> was <unk> by those means .
As I found ( after <unk> him ) that he was a little boy with a naturally large head , I thought that perhaps where his head could go , his body could follow , and mentioned that the best mode of <unk> might be to <unk> him forward .
This was so <unk> received by the <unk> and beadle that he would immediately have been pushed into the area if I had not held his <unk> while Richard and Mr. Guppy ran down through the kitchen to catch him when he should be released .
At last he was happily got down without any accident , and then he began to beat Mr. Guppy with a <unk> in quite a <unk> manner .
Nobody had appeared belonging to the house except a person in pattens , who had been <unk> at the child from below with a broom ; I don ’ t know with what object , and I don ’ t think she did .
I therefore supposed that Mrs. Jellyby was not at home , and was quite surprised when the person appeared in the passage without the pattens , and going up to the back room on the first floor before Ada and me , announced us as , “ <unk> two young ladies , <unk> Jellyby ! ” We passed several more children on the way up , whom it was difficult to avoid <unk> on in the dark ; and as we came into Mrs. Jellyby ’ s presence , one of the poor little things fell downstairs — down a whole flight ( as it sounded to me ) , with a great noise .
Mrs. Jellyby , whose face reflected none of the uneasiness which we could not help showing in our own faces as the dear child ’ s head <unk> its passage with a <unk> on every <unk> — Richard afterwards said he counted seven , besides one for the landing — received us with perfect <unk> .
She was a pretty , very <unk> , <unk> woman of from forty to fifty , with handsome eyes , though they had a curious habit of seeming to look a long way off .
As if — I am <unk> Richard again — they could see nothing nearer than Africa !
“ I am very glad indeed , ” said Mrs. Jellyby in an agreeable voice , “ to have the pleasure of receiving you .
I have a great respect for Mr. Jarndyce , and no one in whom he is interested can be an object of indifference to me . ” We expressed our <unk> and sat down behind the door , where there was a lame <unk> of a sofa .
Mrs. Jellyby had very good hair but was too much occupied with her African duties to brush it .
The shawl in which she had been <unk> muffled dropped <unk> her chair when she advanced to us ; and as she turned to resume her seat , we could not help noticing that her dress didn ’ t nearly meet up the back and that the open space was <unk> across with a <unk> of <unk> — like a <unk> .
The room , which was <unk> with papers and nearly filled by a great <unk> covered with similar litter , was , I must say , not only very untidy but very dirty .
We were obliged to take notice of that with our sense of sight , even while , with our sense of hearing , we followed the poor child who had tumbled downstairs : I think into the back kitchen , where somebody seemed to <unk> him .
But what principally struck us was a <unk> and <unk> though by no means plain girl at the <unk> , who sat biting the <unk> of her pen and staring at us .
I suppose nobody ever was in such a state of ink .
And from her tumbled hair to her pretty feet , which were <unk> with <unk> and broken <unk> <unk> trodden down at <unk> , she really seemed to have no article of dress upon her , from a <unk> <unk> , that was in its proper condition or its right place .
“ You find me , my dears , ” said Mrs. Jellyby , <unk> the two great office candles in tin candlesticks , which made the room taste strongly of hot <unk> ( the fire had gone out , and there was nothing in the grate but ashes , a bundle of wood , and a <unk> ) , “ you find me , my dears , as usual , very busy ; but that you will excuse .
The African project at present <unk> my whole time .
It <unk> me in correspondence with public bodies and with private <unk> anxious for the welfare of their species all over the country .
I am happy to say it is advancing .
We hope by this time next year to have from a hundred and fifty to two hundred healthy families <unk> coffee and <unk> the natives of Borrioboola-Gha , on the left bank of the <unk> . ” As Ada said nothing , but looked at me , I said it must be very gratifying .
“ It IS gratifying , ” said Mrs. Jellyby .
“ It <unk> the devotion of all my <unk> , such as they are ; but that is nothing , so that it <unk> ; and I am more confident of success every day .
Do you know , Miss Summerson , I almost wonder that YOU never turned your thoughts to Africa . ” This application of the subject was really so unexpected to me that I was quite at a loss how to receive it .
I hinted that the <unk> — “ The <unk> <unk> in the world ! ” said Mrs. Jellyby .
“ Indeed , ma ’ am ? ” “ Certainly .
With precaution , ” said Mrs. Jellyby .
“ You may go into Holborn , without precaution , and be run over .
You may go into Holborn , with precaution , and never be run over .
Just so with Africa . ” I said , “ No doubt . ” I meant as to Holborn .
“ If you would like , ” said Mrs. Jellyby , putting a number of papers towards us , “ to look over some remarks on that head , and on the general subject , which have been <unk> <unk> , while I finish a letter I am now <unk> to my eldest daughter , who is my <unk> — ” The girl at the table left off biting her pen and made a return to our recognition , which was half <unk> and half sulky .
“ — I shall then have finished for the present , ” proceeded Mrs. Jellyby with a sweet smile , “ though my work is never done .
Where are you , Caddy ? ” “ ‘ <unk> her compliments to Mr.
<unk> , and begs — ’ ” said Caddy .
“ ‘ And begs , ’ ” said Mrs. Jellyby , <unk> , “ ‘ to inform him , in reference to his letter of inquiry on the African project — ’ No , Peepy !
Not on my account ! ” Peepy ( so <unk> ) was the unfortunate child who had fallen downstairs , who now interrupted the correspondence by <unk> himself , with a <unk> of <unk> on his forehead , to <unk> his wounded knees , in which Ada and I did not know which to pity most — the <unk> or the dirt .
Mrs. Jellyby merely added , with the serene composure with which she said everything , “ Go along , you <unk> Peepy ! ” and fixed her fine eyes on Africa again .
However , as she at once proceeded with her <unk> , and as I interrupted nothing by doing it , I ventured quietly to stop poor Peepy as he was going out and to take him up to nurse .
He looked very much astonished at it and at Ada ’ s kissing him , but soon fell fast asleep in my arms , sobbing at longer and longer intervals , until he was quiet .
I was so occupied with Peepy that I lost the letter in detail , though I derived such a general impression from it of the <unk> importance of Africa , and the utter <unk> of all other places and things , that I felt quite ashamed to have thought so little about it .
“ Six o ’ clock ! ” said Mrs. Jellyby .
“ And our dinner hour is <unk> ( for we dine at all hours ) five !
Caddy , show Miss Clare and Miss Summerson their rooms .
You will like to make some change , perhaps ?
You will excuse me , I know , being so much occupied .
Oh , that very bad child !
Pray put him down , Miss Summerson ! ” I begged permission to retain him , truly saying that he was not at all troublesome , and carried him upstairs and laid him on my bed .
Ada and I had two upper rooms with a door of communication between .
They were <unk> bare and <unk> , and the curtain to my window was fastened up with a fork .
“ You would like some hot water , wouldn ’ t you ? ” said Miss Jellyby , looking round for a <unk> with a handle to it , but looking in vain .
“ If it is not being troublesome , ” said we .
“ Oh , it ’ s not the trouble , ” returned Miss Jellyby ; “ the question is , if there IS any . ” The evening was so very cold and the rooms had such a <unk> smell that I must confess it was a little miserable , and Ada was half crying .
We soon laughed , however , and were busily <unk> when Miss Jellyby came back to say that she was sorry there was no hot water , but they couldn ’ t find the <unk> , and the <unk> was out of order .
We begged her not to mention it and made all the haste we could to get down to the fire again .
But all the little children had come up to the landing outside to look at the phenomenon of Peepy lying on my bed , and our attention was <unk> by the constant <unk> of <unk> and fingers in <unk> of danger between the <unk> of the doors .
It was impossible to shut the door of either room , for my lock , with no <unk> to it , looked as if it wanted to be wound up ; and though the handle of Ada ’ s went round and round with the greatest <unk> , it was attended with no effect whatever on the door .
Therefore I proposed to the children that they should come in and be very good at my table , and I would tell them the story of Little <unk> <unk> <unk> while I dressed ; which they did , and were as quiet as <unk> , including Peepy , who awoke <unk> before the appearance of the <unk> .
When we went downstairs we found a <unk> with “ A <unk> from <unk> <unk> ” on it lighted up in the staircase window with a <unk> <unk> , and a young woman , with a swelled face bound up in a <unk> <unk> blowing the fire of the drawing-room ( now connected by an open door with Mrs. Jellyby ’ s room ) and choking dreadfully .
It smoked to that degree , in short , that we all sat coughing and crying with the windows open for half an hour , during which Mrs. Jellyby , with the same <unk> of temper , directed letters about Africa .
Her being so employed was , I must say , a great relief to me , for Richard told us that he had washed his hands in a <unk> and that they had found the <unk> on his <unk> , and he made Ada laugh so that they made me laugh in the most ridiculous manner .
<unk> after seven o ’ clock we went down to dinner , carefully , by Mrs. Jellyby ’ s advice , for the <unk> , besides being very deficient in <unk> , were so torn as to be <unk> <unk> .
We had a fine <unk> , a piece of <unk> <unk> , a dish of <unk> , and a <unk> ; an excellent dinner , if it had had any <unk> to speak of , but it was almost raw .
The young woman with the <unk> <unk> waited , and dropped everything on the table wherever it happened to go , and never moved it again until she put it on the stairs .
The person I had seen in pattens , who I suppose to have been the cook , frequently came and <unk> with her at the door , and there appeared to be ill will between them .
All through dinner — which was long , in consequence of such <unk> as the dish of potatoes being <unk> in the coal <unk> and the handle of the <unk> coming off and striking the young woman in the chin — Mrs.
Jellyby preserved the <unk> of her disposition .
She told us a great deal that was interesting about Borrioboola-Gha and the natives , and received so many letters that Richard , who sat by her , saw four <unk> in the gravy at once .
Some of the letters were proceedings of ladies ’ committees or <unk> of ladies ’ <unk> , which she read to us ; others were <unk> from people excited in various ways about the <unk> of coffee , and natives ; others required answers , and these she sent her eldest daughter from the table three or four times to write .
She was full of business and undoubtedly was , as she had told us , devoted to the cause .
I was a little curious to know who a mild bald gentleman in spectacles was , who dropped into a vacant chair ( there was no top or bottom in particular ) after the fish was taken away and seemed <unk> to submit himself to Borrioboola-Gha but not to be <unk> interested in that settlement .
As he never spoke a word , he might have been a native but for his complexion .
It was not until we left the table and he remained alone with Richard that the possibility of his being Mr. Jellyby ever entered my head .
But he WAS Mr. Jellyby ; and a <unk> young man called Mr. Quale , with large shining knobs for temples and his hair all brushed to the back of his head , who came in the evening , and told Ada he was a <unk> , also informed her that he called the <unk> <unk> of Mrs. Jellyby with Mr. Jellyby the <unk> of mind and matter .
This young man , besides having a great deal to say for himself about Africa and a project of his for teaching the coffee <unk> to teach the natives to turn <unk> legs and establish an <unk> trade , delighted in drawing Mrs. Jellyby out by saying , “ I believe now , Mrs. Jellyby , you have received as many as from one hundred and fifty to two hundred letters respecting Africa in a single day , have you not ? ” or , “ If my memory does not deceive me , Mrs. Jellyby , you once mentioned that you had sent off five thousand <unk> from one post-office at one time ? ” — always repeating Mrs. Jellyby ’ s answer to us like an <unk> .
During the whole evening , Mr. Jellyby sat in a corner with his head against the wall as if he were subject to low spirits .
It seemed that he had several times opened his mouth when alone with Richard after dinner , as if he had something on his mind , but had always shut it again , to Richard ’ s extreme confusion , without saying anything .
Mrs. Jellyby , sitting in quite a <unk> of waste paper , <unk> coffee all the evening and <unk> at intervals to her eldest daughter .
She also held a <unk> with Mr. Quale , of which the subject seemed to be — if I understood it — the <unk> of humanity , and gave utterance to some beautiful sentiments .
I was not so attentive an <unk> as I might have wished to be , however , for Peepy and the other children came <unk> about Ada and me in a corner of the drawing-room to ask for another story ; so we sat down among them and told them in whispers “ <unk> in <unk> ” and I don ’ t know what else until Mrs. Jellyby , accidentally remembering them , sent them to bed .
As Peepy cried for me to take him to bed , I carried him upstairs , where the young woman with the <unk> <unk> charged into the midst of the little family like a dragon and <unk> them into <unk> .
After that I occupied myself in making our room a little tidy and in <unk> a very cross fire that had been lighted to burn , which at last it did , quite brightly .
On my return downstairs , I felt that Mrs. Jellyby looked down upon me rather for being so <unk> , and I was sorry for it , though at the same time I knew that I had no higher pretensions .
It was nearly midnight before we found an opportunity of going to bed , and even then we left Mrs. Jellyby among her papers drinking coffee and Miss Jellyby biting the <unk> of her pen .
“ What a strange house ! ” said Ada when we got upstairs .
“ How curious of my cousin Jarndyce to send us here ! ” “ My love , ” said I , “ it quite <unk> me .
I want to understand it , and I can ’ t understand it at all . ” “ What ? ” asked Ada with her pretty smile .
“ All this , my dear , ” said I.
“ It MUST be very good of Mrs. Jellyby to take such pains about a scheme for the <unk> of natives — and yet — Peepy and the housekeeping ! ” Ada laughed and put her arm about my neck as I stood looking at the fire , and told me I was a quiet , dear , good creature and had won her heart .
“ You are so thoughtful , Esther , ” she said , “ and yet so cheerful !
And you do so much , so <unk> !
You would make a home out of even this house . ” My simple darling !
She was quite unconscious that she only praised herself and that it was in the goodness of her own heart that she made so much of me !
“ May I ask you a question ? ” said I when we had sat before the fire a little while .
“ <unk> hundred , ” said Ada .
“ Your cousin , Mr. Jarndyce .
I owe so much to him .
Would you mind <unk> him to me ? ” <unk> her golden hair , Ada turned her eyes upon me with such laughing wonder that I was full of wonder too , partly at her beauty , partly at her surprise .
“ Esther ! ” she cried .
“ My dear ! ” “ You want a description of my cousin Jarndyce ? ” “ My dear , I never saw him . ” “ And I never saw him ! ” returned Ada .
Well , to be sure !
No , she had never seen him .
Young as she was when her mama died , she remembered how the tears would come into her eyes when she spoke of him and of the noble generosity of his character , which she had said was to be trusted above all earthly things ; and Ada trusted it .
Her cousin Jarndyce had written to her a few months ago — “ a plain , honest letter , ” Ada said — proposing the arrangement we were now to enter on and telling her that “ in time it might <unk> some of the <unk> made by the miserable Chancery suit . ” She had replied , <unk> <unk> his proposal .
Richard had received a similar letter and had made a similar <unk> .
He HAD seen Mr. Jarndyce once , but only once , five years ago , at <unk> school .
He had told Ada , when they were leaning on the screen before the fire where I found them , that he <unk> him as “ a <unk> , rosy fellow . ” This was the utmost description Ada could give me .
It set me thinking so that when Ada was asleep , I still remained before the fire , wondering and wondering about Bleak House , and wondering and wondering that yesterday morning should seem so long ago .
I don ’ t know where my thoughts had wandered when they were recalled by a tap at the door .
I opened it softly and found Miss Jellyby shivering there with a broken candle in a broken <unk> in one hand and an <unk> in the other .
“ Good night ! ” she said very <unk> .
“ Good night ! ” said I.
“ May I come in ? ” she shortly and unexpectedly asked me in the same sulky way .
“ Certainly , ” said I.
“ Don ’ t wake Miss Clare . ” She would not sit down , but stood by the fire <unk> her inky middle finger in the <unk> , which contained <unk> , and <unk> it over the ink <unk> on her face , frowning the whole time and looking very gloomy .
“ I wish Africa was dead ! ” she said on a sudden .
I was going to <unk> .
“ I do ! ” she said “ Don ’ t talk to me , Miss Summerson .
I <unk> it and <unk> it .
It ’ s a <unk> ! ” I told her she was tired , and I was sorry .
I put my hand upon her head , and touched her forehead , and said it was hot now but would be cool to-morrow .
She still stood <unk> and frowning at me , but presently put down her <unk> and turned softly towards the bed where Ada lay .
“ She is very pretty ! ” she said with the same <unk> brow and in the same <unk> manner .
I assented with a smile .
“ An orphan .
Ain ’ t she ? ” “ Yes . ” “ But knows a quantity , I suppose ?
Can dance , and play music , and sing ?
She can talk French , I suppose , and do <unk> , and <unk> , and needlework , and everything ? ” “ No doubt , ” said I.
“ I can ’ t , ” she returned .
“ I can ’ t do anything hardly , except write .
I ’ m always writing for Ma .
I wonder you two were not ashamed of yourselves to come in this afternoon and see me able to do nothing else .
It was like your ill nature .
Yet you think yourselves very fine , I dare say ! ” I could see that the poor girl was near crying , and I resumed my chair without speaking and looked at her ( I hope ) as mildly as I felt towards her .
“ It ’ s disgraceful , ” she said .
“ You know it is .
The whole house is disgraceful .
The children are disgraceful .
I ’ M disgraceful .
Pa ’ s miserable , and no wonder !
<unk> drinks — she ’ s always drinking .
It ’ s a great shame and a great story of you if you say you didn ’ t smell her to-day .
It was as bad as a public-house , waiting at dinner ; you know it was ! ” “ My dear , I don ’ t know it , ” said I.
“ You do , ” she said very shortly .
“ You <unk> ’ t say you don ’ t .
You do ! ” “ Oh , my dear ! ” said I.
“ If you won ’ t let me speak — ” “ You ’ re speaking now .
You know you are .
Don ’ t tell stories , Miss Summerson . ” “ My dear , ” said I , “ as long as you won ’ t hear me out — ” “ I don ’ t want to hear you out . ” “ Oh , yes , I think you do , ” said I , “ because that would be so very unreasonable .
I did not know what you tell me because the servant did not come near me at dinner ; but I don ’ t doubt what you tell me , and I am sorry to hear it . ” “ You needn ’ t make a merit of that , ” said she .
“ No , my dear , ” said I.
“ That would be very foolish . ” She was still standing by the bed , and now stooped down ( but still with the same <unk> face ) and kissed Ada .
That done , she came softly back and stood by the side of my chair .
Her bosom was <unk> in a <unk> manner that I greatly pitied , but I thought it better not to speak .
“ I wish I was dead ! ” she broke out .
“ I wish we were all dead .
It would be a great deal better for us . ” In a moment afterwards , she <unk> on the ground at my side , hid her face in my dress , <unk> begged my pardon , and wept .
I <unk> her and would have raised her , but she cried no , no ; she wanted to stay there !
“ You used to teach girls , ” she said , “ If you could only have taught me , I could have learnt from you !
I am so very miserable , and I like you so much ! ” I could not persuade her to sit by me or to do anything but move a ragged stool to where she was <unk> , and take that , and still hold my dress in the same manner .
By degrees the poor tired girl fell asleep , and then I <unk> to raise her head so that it should rest on my lap , and to cover us both with <unk> .
The fire went out , and all night long she <unk> thus before the <unk> grate .
At first I was <unk> awake and <unk> tried to lose myself , with my eyes closed , among the <unk> of the day .
At length , by slow degrees , they became indistinct and mingled .
I began to lose the <unk> of the <unk> resting on me .
Now it was Ada , now one of my old Reading friends from whom I could not believe I had so recently parted .
Now it was the little mad woman worn out with <unk> and smiling , now some one in authority at Bleak House .
<unk> , it was no one , and I was no one .
The <unk> day was <unk> <unk> with the fog when I opened my eyes to encounter those of a <unk> little <unk> fixed upon me .
Peepy had <unk> his <unk> , and crept down in his <unk> and cap , and was so cold that his teeth were chattering as if he had cut them all .
CHAPTER <unk> A <unk> <unk> Although the morning was raw , and although the fog still seemed heavy — I say seemed , for the windows were so <unk> with dirt that they would have made <unk> sunshine dim — I was sufficiently <unk> of the <unk> within doors at that early hour and sufficiently curious about London to think it a good idea on the part of Miss Jellyby when she proposed that we should go out for a walk .
“ Ma won ’ t be down for ever so long , ” she said , “ and then it ’ s a chance if breakfast ’ s ready for an hour afterwards , they <unk> so .
As to Pa , he gets what he can and goes to the office .
He never has what you would call a regular breakfast .
<unk> leaves him out the <unk> and some milk , when there is any , <unk> .
Sometimes there isn ’ t any milk , and sometimes the cat drinks it .
But I ’ m afraid you must be tired , Miss Summerson , and perhaps you would rather go to bed . ” “ I am not at all tired , my dear , ” said I , “ and would much prefer to go out . ” “ If you ’ re sure you would , ” returned Miss Jellyby , “ I ’ ll get my things on . ” Ada said she would go too , and was soon <unk> .
I made a proposal to Peepy , in <unk> of being able to do anything better for him , that he should let me <unk> him and afterwards lay him down on my bed again .
To this he <unk> with the best grace possible , staring at me during the whole <unk> as if he never had been , and never could again be , so astonished in his life — looking very miserable also , certainly , but making no complaint , and going <unk> to sleep as soon as it was over .
At first I was in two minds about taking such a liberty , but I soon reflected that nobody in the house was likely to notice it .
What with the bustle of <unk> Peepy and the bustle of getting myself ready and helping Ada , I was soon quite in a glow .
We found Miss Jellyby trying to warm herself at the fire in the <unk> , which <unk> was then lighting with a <unk> parlour <unk> , throwing the candle in to make it burn better .
Everything was just as we had left it last night and was evidently intended to remain so .
<unk> the <unk> had not been taken away , but had been left ready for breakfast .
<unk> , dust , and waste-paper were all over the house .
Some <unk> pots and a <unk> hung on the area <unk> ; the door stood open ; and we met the cook round the corner coming out of a public-house , wiping her mouth .
She mentioned , as she passed us , that she had been to see what o ’ clock it was .
But before we met the cook , we met Richard , who was dancing up and down Thavies Inn to warm his feet .
He was <unk> surprised to see us stirring so soon and said he would <unk> share our walk .
So he took care of Ada , and Miss Jellyby and I went first .
I may mention that Miss Jellyby had <unk> into her sulky manner and that I really should not have thought she liked me much unless she had told me so .
“ Where would you wish to go ? ” she asked .
“ <unk> , my dear , ” I replied .
“ <unk> ’ s nowhere , ” said Miss Jellyby , stopping <unk> .
“ Let us go somewhere at any rate , ” said I.
She then walked me on very fast .
“ I don ’ t care ! ” she said .
“ Now , you are my witness , Miss Summerson , I say I don ’ t care — but if he was to come to our house with his great , shining , <unk> forehead night after night till he was as old as <unk> , I wouldn ’ t have anything to say to him .
Such <unk> as he and Ma make of themselves ! ” “ My dear ! ” I remonstrated , in allusion to the <unk> and the <unk> emphasis Miss Jellyby set upon it .
“ Your duty as a child — ” “ Oh !
Don ’ t talk of duty as a child , Miss Summerson ; where ’ s Ma ’ s duty as a parent ?
All made over to the public and Africa , I suppose !
Then let the public and Africa show duty as a child ; it ’ s much more their affair than mine .
You are shocked , I dare say !
Very well , so am I shocked too ; so we are both shocked , and there ’ s an end of it ! ” She walked me on <unk> yet .
“ But for all that , I say again , he may come , and come , and come , and I won ’ t have anything to say to him .
I can ’ t bear him .
If there ’ s any stuff in the world that I <unk> and <unk> , it ’ s the stuff he and Ma talk .
I wonder the very <unk> opposite our house can have the patience to stay there and be a witness of such <unk> and <unk> as all that sounding nonsense , and Ma ’ s <unk> ! ” I could not but understand her to refer to Mr. Quale , the young gentleman who had appeared after dinner yesterday .
I was saved the disagreeable necessity of pursuing the subject by Richard and Ada coming up at a round pace , laughing and asking us if we meant to run a race .
Thus interrupted , Miss Jellyby became silent and walked moodily on at my side while I admired the long <unk> and <unk> of streets , the quantity of people already going to and fro , the number of vehicles passing and <unk> , the busy preparations in the setting forth of shop windows and the sweeping out of shops , and the extraordinary creatures in rags secretly groping among the <unk> rubbish for <unk> and other refuse .
“ So , cousin , ” said the cheerful voice of Richard to Ada behind me .
“ We are never to get out of Chancery !
We have come by another way to our place of meeting yesterday , and — by the Great Seal , here ’ s the old lady again ! ” Truly , there she was , immediately in front of us , <unk> , and smiling , and saying with her yesterday ’ s air of patronage , “ The wards in Jarndyce !
Ve-ry happy , I am sure ! ” “ You are out early , ma ’ am , ” said I as she <unk> to me .
“ Ye-es !
I usually walk here early .
Before the court sits .
It ’ s retired .
I <unk> my thoughts here for the business of the day , ” said the old lady <unk> .
“ The business of the day requires a great deal of thought .
Chancery justice is so <unk> difficult to follow . ” “ Who ’ s this , Miss Summerson ? ” whispered Miss Jellyby , drawing my arm tighter through her own .
The little old lady ’ s hearing was remarkably quick .
She answered for herself directly .
“ A suitor , my child .
At your service .
I have the honour to attend court regularly .
With my documents .
Have I the pleasure of addressing another of the youthful parties in Jarndyce ? ” said the old lady , recovering herself , with her head on one side , from a very low curtsy .
Richard , anxious to <unk> for his <unk> of yesterday , <unk> explained that Miss Jellyby was not connected with the suit .
“ Ha ! ” said the old lady .
“ She does not expect a judgment ?
She will still grow old .
But not so old .
Oh , dear , no !
This is the garden of Lincoln ’ s Inn .
I call it my garden .
It is quite a <unk> in the <unk> .
Where the birds sing <unk> .
I pass the greater part of the long vacation here .
In contemplation .
You find the long vacation exceedingly long , don ’ t you ? ” We said yes , as she seemed to expect us to say so .
“ When the leaves are falling from the trees and there are no more flowers in bloom to make up into <unk> for the Lord Chancellor ’ s court , ” said the old lady , “ the vacation is <unk> and the <unk> seal , mentioned in the <unk> , again <unk> .
Pray come and see my lodging .
It will be a good omen for me .
<unk> , and hope , and beauty are very seldom there .
It is a long , long time since I had a visit from either . ” She had taken my hand , and leading me and Miss Jellyby away , <unk> Richard and Ada to come too .
I did not know how to excuse myself and looked to Richard for aid .
As he was half amused and half curious and all in doubt how to get rid of the old lady without offence , she continued to lead us away , and he and Ada continued to follow , our strange <unk> informing us all the time , with much smiling condescension , that she lived close by .
It was quite true , as it soon appeared .
She lived so close by that we had not time to have done <unk> her for a few moments before she was at home .
<unk> us out at a little side gate , the old lady stopped most unexpectedly in a narrow back street , part of some courts and <unk> immediately outside the wall of the inn , and said , “ This is my lodging .
Pray walk up ! ” She had stopped at a shop over which was written <unk> , <unk> AND <unk> <unk> .
Also , in long thin letters , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In one part of the window was a picture of a red paper mill at which a cart was <unk> a quantity of <unk> of old rags .
In another was the inscription <unk> BOUGHT .
In another , <unk> BOUGHT .
In another , <unk> <unk> BOUGHT .
In another , <unk> BOUGHT .
In another , <unk> ’ AND <unk> ’ S <unk> BOUGHT .
Everything seemed to be bought and nothing to be sold there .
In all parts of the window were <unk> of dirty bottles — <unk> bottles , medicine bottles , <unk> and <unk> bottles , <unk> bottles , wine bottles , ink bottles ; I am reminded by mentioning the latter that the shop had in several little particulars the air of being in a legal neighbourhood and of being , as it were , a dirty <unk> and <unk> relation of the law .
There were a great many ink bottles .
There was a little <unk> bench of shabby old <unk> outside the door , <unk> “ <unk> <unk> , all at <unk> . ” Some of the <unk> I have <unk> were written in <unk> , like the papers I had seen in Kenge and Carboy ’ s office and the letters I had so long received from the firm .
Among them was one , in the same writing , having nothing to do with the business of the shop , but announcing that a respectable man aged <unk> wanted <unk> or copying to execute with <unk> and dispatch : <unk> to Nemo , care of Mr. Krook , within .
There were several second-hand bags , blue and red , hanging up .
A little way within the shop-door lay heaps of old <unk> parchment <unk> and discoloured and dog ’ <unk> <unk> .
I could have fancied that all the rusty keys , of which there must have been hundreds <unk> together as old iron , had once <unk> to doors of rooms or strong <unk> in lawyers ’ offices .
The litter of rags tumbled partly into and partly out of a <unk> wooden scale , hanging without any <unk> from a <unk> , might have been <unk> ’ <unk> and gowns torn up .
One had only to fancy , as Richard whispered to Ada and me while we all stood looking in , that yonder bones in a corner , <unk> together and picked very clean , were the bones of clients , to make the picture complete .
As it was still <unk> and dark , and as the shop was <unk> besides by the wall of Lincoln ’ s Inn , <unk> the light within a couple of yards , we should not have seen so much but for a lighted lantern that an old man in spectacles and a <unk> cap was carrying about in the shop .
<unk> towards the door , he now caught sight of us .
He was short , <unk> , and withered , with his head sunk sideways between his shoulders and the breath <unk> in visible smoke from his mouth as if he were on fire within .
His throat , chin , and eyebrows were so <unk> with white <unk> and so <unk> with <unk> and <unk> <unk> that he looked from his breast upward like some old <unk> in a fall of snow .
“ Hi , <unk> ! ” said the old man , coming to the door .
“ Have you anything to sell ? ” We naturally drew back and glanced at our <unk> , who had been trying to open the <unk> with a key she had taken from her pocket , and to whom Richard now said that as we had had the pleasure of seeing where she lived , we would leave her , being pressed for time .
But she was not to be so easily left .
She became so <unk> and <unk> earnest in her entreaties that we would walk up and see her apartment for an instant , and was so bent , in her harmless way , on leading me in , as part of the good omen she desired , that I ( whatever the others might do ) saw nothing for it but to comply .
I suppose we were all more or less curious ; at any rate , when the old man added his <unk> to hers and said , “ Aye , aye !
Please her !
It won ’ t take a minute !
Come in , come in !
Come in through the shop if t ’ other door ’ s out of order ! ” we all went in , <unk> by Richard ’ s laughing encouragement and <unk> on his protection .
“ My landlord , Krook , ” said the little old lady , condescending to him from her lofty station as she presented him to us .
“ He is called among the neighbours the Lord Chancellor .
His shop is called the Court of Chancery .
He is a very eccentric person .
He is very odd .
Oh , I assure you he is very odd ! ” She shook her head a great many times and tapped her forehead with her finger to express to us that we must have the goodness to excuse him , “ For he is a little — you know — M ! ” said the old lady with great <unk> .
The old man overheard , and laughed .
“ It ’ s true enough , ” he said , going before us with the lantern , “ that they call me the Lord Chancellor and call my shop Chancery .
And why do you think they call me the Lord Chancellor and my shop Chancery ? ” “ I don ’ t know , I am sure ! ” said Richard rather carelessly .
“ You see , ” said the old man , stopping and turning round , “ they — Hi !
Here ’ s lovely hair !
I have got three <unk> of ladies ’ hair below , but none so beautiful and fine as this .
What colour , and what <unk> ! ” “ That ’ ll do , my good friend ! ” said Richard , strongly <unk> of his having drawn one of Ada ’ s <unk> through his yellow hand .
“ You can admire as the rest of us do without taking that liberty . ” The old man <unk> at him a sudden look which even called my attention from Ada , who , startled and blushing , was so remarkably beautiful that she seemed to <unk> the wandering attention of the little old lady herself .
But as Ada interposed and laughingly said she could only feel proud of such genuine admiration , Mr. Krook <unk> into his former self as suddenly as he had <unk> out of it .
“ You see , I have so many things here , ” he resumed , holding up the lantern , “ of so many kinds , and all as the neighbours think ( but THEY know nothing ) , <unk> away and going to <unk> and ruin , that that ’ s why they have given me and my place a <unk> .
And I have so many old <unk> and papers in my stock .
And I have a liking for <unk> and must and <unk> .
And all ’ s fish that comes to my <unk> .
And I can ’ t <unk> to part with anything I once lay hold of ( or so my neighbours think , but what do THEY know ? )
or to <unk> anything , or to have any sweeping , nor <unk> , nor <unk> , nor <unk> going on about me .
That ’ s the way I ’ ve got the ill name of Chancery .
I don ’ t mind .
I go to see my noble and learned brother pretty well every day , when he sits in the Inn .
He don ’ t notice me , but I notice him .
There ’ s no great odds <unk> us .
We both <unk> on in a <unk> .
Hi , Lady Jane ! ” A large grey cat <unk> from some neighbouring shelf on his shoulder and startled us all .
“ Hi !
<unk> ’ em how you scratch .
Hi !
<unk> , my lady ! ” said her master .
The cat <unk> down and <unk> at a bundle of rags with her <unk> <unk> , with a sound that it set my teeth on <unk> to hear .
“ She ’ d do as much for any one I was to set her on , ” said the old man .
“ I deal in <unk> among other general matters , and hers was offered to me .
It ’ s a very fine <unk> , as you may see , but I didn ’ t have it <unk> off !
THAT warn ’ t like Chancery practice though , says you ! ” He had by this time led us across the shop , and now opened a door in the back part of it , leading to the <unk> .
As he stood with his hand upon the lock , the little old lady <unk> observed to him before passing out , “ That will do , Krook .
You mean well , but are tiresome .
My young friends are pressed for time .
I have none to spare myself , having to attend court very soon .
My young friends are the wards in Jarndyce . ” “ Jarndyce ! ” said the old man with a start .
“ Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
The great suit , Krook , ” returned his lodger .
“ Hi ! ” exclaimed the old man in a tone of thoughtful amazement and with a <unk> stare than before .
“ Think of it ! ” He seemed so <unk> all in a moment and looked so curiously at us that Richard said , “ Why , you appear to trouble yourself a good deal about the causes before your noble and learned brother , the other Chancellor ! ” “ Yes , ” said the old man <unk> .
“ <unk> !
YOUR name now will be — ” “ Richard Carstone . ” “ Carstone , ” he repeated , slowly <unk> off that name upon his forefinger ; and each of the others he went on to mention upon a separate finger .
“ Yes .
There was the name of Barbary , and the name of Clare , and the name of Dedlock , too , I think . ” “ He knows as much of the cause as the real <unk> Chancellor ! ” said Richard , quite astonished , to Ada and me .
“ Aye ! ” said the old man , coming slowly out of his <unk> .
“ Yes !
Tom Jarndyce — you ’ ll excuse me , being related ; but he was never known about court by any other name , and was as well known there as — she is now , ” nodding slightly at his lodger .
“ Tom Jarndyce was often in here .
He got into a restless habit of <unk> about when the cause was on , or expected , talking to the little <unk> and telling ’ em to keep out of Chancery , whatever they did .
‘ For , ’ says he , ‘ it ’ s being ground to bits in a slow mill ; it ’ s being <unk> at a slow fire ; it ’ s being <unk> to death by single <unk> ; it ’ s being <unk> by drops ; it ’ s going mad by <unk> . ’ He was as near making away with himself , just where the young lady stands , as near could be . ” We listened with horror .
“ He come in at the door , ” said the old man , slowly pointing an imaginary track along the shop , “ on the day he did it — the whole neighbourhood had said for months before that he would do it , of a certainty sooner or later — he come in at the door that day , and walked along there , and sat himself on a bench that stood there , and asked me ( you ’ ll judge I was a mortal sight younger then ) to fetch him a pint of wine .
‘ For , ’ says he , ‘ Krook , I am much depressed ; my cause is on again , and I think I ’ m nearer judgment than I ever was . ’ I hadn ’ t a mind to leave him alone ; and I persuaded him to go to the <unk> over the way there , t ’ other side my lane ( I mean Chancery Lane ) ; and I followed and looked in at the window , and saw him , comfortable as I thought , in the arm-chair by the fire , and company with him .
I hadn ’ t hardly got back here when I heard a shot go echoing and <unk> right away into the inn .
I ran out — neighbours ran out — twenty of us cried at once , ‘ Tom Jarndyce ! ’ ” The old man stopped , looked hard at us , looked down into the lantern , blew the light out , and shut the lantern up .
“ We were right , I needn ’ t tell the present <unk> .
Hi !
To be sure , how the neighbourhood poured into court that afternoon while the cause was on !
How my noble and learned brother , and all the rest of ’ em , <unk> and <unk> away as usual and tried to look as if they hadn ’ t heard a word of the last fact in the case or as if they had — Oh , dear me ! — nothing at all to do with it if they had heard of it by any chance ! ” Ada ’ s colour had entirely left her , and Richard was scarcely less pale .
Nor could I wonder , judging even from my emotions , and I was no party in the suit , that to hearts so <unk> and fresh it was a shock to come into the inheritance of a <unk> misery , attended in the minds of many people with such dreadful <unk> .
I had another uneasiness , in the application of the painful story to the poor <unk> creature who had brought us there ; but , to my surprise , she seemed perfectly unconscious of that and only led the way upstairs again , informing us with the <unk> of a superior creature for the <unk> of a common mortal that her landlord was “ a little — M — , you know ! ” She lived at the top of the house , in a pretty large room , from which she had a glimpse of Lincoln ’ s Inn Hall .
This seemed to have been her principal <unk> , originally , for taking up her residence there .
She could look at it , she said , in the night , especially in the <unk> .
Her room was clean , but very , very bare .
I noticed the <unk> <unk> in the way of furniture ; a few old <unk> from books , of Chancellors and <unk> , <unk> against the wall ; and some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , “ containing documents , ” as she informed us .
There were neither <unk> nor ashes in the grate , and I saw no articles of <unk> anywhere , nor any kind of food .
Upon a shelf in an open cupboard were a plate or two , a cup or two , and so forth , but all dry and empty .
There was a more affecting meaning in her pinched appearance , I thought as I looked round , than I had understood before .
“ <unk> honoured , I am sure , ” said our poor <unk> with the greatest <unk> , “ by this visit from the wards in Jarndyce .
And very much <unk> for the omen .
It is a retired situation .
<unk> .
I am limited as to situation .
In consequence of the necessity of attending on the Chancellor .
I have lived here many years .
I pass my days in court , my evenings and my nights here .
I find the nights long , for I sleep but little and think much .
That is , of course , <unk> , being in Chancery .
I am sorry I cannot offer <unk> .
I expect a judgment shortly and shall then place my establishment on a superior footing .
At present , I don ’ t mind <unk> to the wards in Jarndyce ( in strict confidence ) that I sometimes find it difficult to keep up a genteel appearance .
I have felt the cold here .
I have felt something <unk> than cold .
It matters very little .
Pray excuse the introduction of such mean <unk> . ” She partly drew aside the curtain of the long , low <unk> window and called our attention to a number of <unk> hanging there , some containing several birds .
There were <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> — I should think at least twenty .
“ I began to keep the little creatures , ” she said , “ with an object that the wards will readily comprehend .
With the intention of <unk> them to liberty .
When my judgment should be given .
Ye-es !
They die in prison , though .
Their lives , poor silly things , are so short in comparison with Chancery proceedings that , one by one , the whole collection has died over and over again .
I doubt , do you know , whether one of these , though they are all young , will live to be free !
Ve-ry <unk> , is it not ? ” Although she sometimes asked a question , she never seemed to expect a reply , but <unk> on as if she were in the habit of doing so when no one but herself was present .
“ Indeed , ” she pursued , “ I positively doubt sometimes , I do assure you , whether while matters are still unsettled , and the <unk> or Great Seal still <unk> , I may not one day be found lying <unk> and <unk> here , as I have found so many birds ! ” Richard , answering what he saw in Ada ’ s compassionate eyes , took the opportunity of laying some money , softly and <unk> , on the chimney-piece .
We all drew nearer to the <unk> , <unk> to <unk> the birds .
“ I can ’ t allow them to sing much , ” said the little old lady , “ for ( you ’ ll think this curious ) I find my mind confused by the idea that they are singing while I am following the <unk> in court .
And my mind requires to be so very clear , you know !
Another time , I ’ ll tell you their names .
Not at present .
On a day of such good omen , they shall sing as much as they like .
In honour of youth , ” a smile and curtsy , “ hope , ” a smile and curtsy , “ and beauty , ” a smile and curtsy .
“ There !
We ’ ll let in the full light . ” The birds began to stir and <unk> .
“ I cannot admit the air freely , ” said the little old lady — the room was close , and would have been the better for it — “ because the cat you saw downstairs , called Lady Jane , is <unk> for their lives .
She <unk> on the parapet outside for hours and hours .
I have discovered , ” whispering mysteriously , “ that her natural <unk> is <unk> by a jealous fear of their <unk> their liberty .
In consequence of the judgment I expect being shortly given .
She is <unk> and full of <unk> .
I half believe , sometimes , that she is no cat , but the <unk> of the old saying .
It is so very difficult to keep her from the door . ” Some neighbouring bells , <unk> the poor soul that it was half-past nine , did more for us in the way of bringing our visit to an end than we could easily have done for ourselves .
She hurriedly took up her little bag of documents , which she had laid upon the table on coming in , and asked if we were also going into court .
On our answering no , and that we would on no account <unk> her , she opened the door to attend us downstairs .
“ With such an omen , it is even more necessary than usual that I should be there before the Chancellor comes in , ” said she , “ for he might mention my case the first thing .
I have a <unk> that he WILL mention it the first thing this morning . ” She stopped to tell us in a whisper as we were going down that the whole house was filled with strange <unk> which her landlord had bought <unk> and had no wish to sell , in consequence of being a little M. This was on the first floor .
But she had made a previous <unk> on the second floor and had silently pointed at a dark door there .
“ The only other lodger , ” she now whispered in explanation , “ a law-writer .
The children in the <unk> here say he has sold himself to the devil .
I don ’ t know what he can have done with the money .
Hush ! ” She appeared to mistrust that the lodger might hear her even there , and repeating “ Hush ! ” went before us on <unk> as though even the sound of her footsteps might <unk> to him what she had said .
<unk> through the shop on our way out , as we had passed through it on our way in , we found the old man <unk> a quantity of <unk> of waste-paper in a kind of well in the floor .
He seemed to be working hard , with the <unk> standing on his forehead , and had a piece of <unk> by him , with which , as he put each separate <unk> or bundle down , he made a crooked mark on the <unk> of the wall .
Richard and Ada , and Miss Jellyby , and the little old lady had gone by him , and I was going when he touched me on the arm to stay me , and <unk> the letter <unk> upon the wall — in a very curious manner , beginning with the end of the letter and <unk> it backward .
It was a capital letter , not a printed one , but just such a letter as any clerk in Messrs. Kenge and Carboy ’ s office would have made .
“ Can you read it ? ” he asked me with a keen glance .
“ Surely , ” said I.
“ It ’ s very plain . ” “ What is it ? ” “ <unk> ” With another glance at me , and a glance at the door , he rubbed it out and turned an “ a ” in its place ( not a capital letter this time ) , and said , “ What ’ s that ? ” I told him .
He then rubbed that out and turned the letter “ <unk> , ” and asked me the same question .
He went on quickly until he had formed in the same curious manner , beginning at the ends and <unk> of the letters , the word Jarndyce , without once leaving two letters on the wall together .
“ What does that <unk> ? ” he asked me .
When I told him , he laughed .
In the same odd way , yet with the same <unk> , he then produced <unk> , and rubbed out <unk> , the letters <unk> the words Bleak House .
These , in some astonishment , I also read ; and he laughed again .
“ Hi ! ” said the old man , laying aside the <unk> .
“ I have a turn for copying from memory , you see , miss , though I can neither read nor write . ” He looked so disagreeable and his cat looked so <unk> at me , as if I were a <unk> of the birds upstairs , that I was quite relieved by Richard ’ s appearing at the door and saying , “ Miss Summerson , I hope you are not <unk> for the <unk> of your hair .
Don ’ t be tempted .
Three <unk> below are quite enough for Mr. Krook ! ” I lost no time in <unk> Mr. Krook good morning and <unk> my friends outside , where we parted with the little old lady , who gave us her blessing with great ceremony and renewed her assurance of yesterday in reference to her intention of <unk> <unk> on Ada and me .
Before we finally turned out of those <unk> , we looked back and saw Mr. Krook standing at his shop-door , in his spectacles , looking after us , with his cat upon his shoulder , and her <unk> sticking up on one side of his <unk> cap like a tall <unk> .
“ Quite an <unk> for a morning in London ! ” said Richard with a sigh .
“ Ah , cousin , cousin , it ’ s a weary word this Chancery ! ” “ It is to me , and has been ever since I can remember , ” returned Ada .
“ I am grieved that I should be the enemy — as I suppose I am — of a great number of relations and others , and that they should be my enemies — as I suppose they are — and that we should all be <unk> one another without knowing how or why and be in constant doubt and <unk> all our lives .
It seems very strange , as there must be right somewhere , that an honest judge in real earnest has not been able to find out through all these years where it is . ” “ Ah , cousin ! ” said Richard .
“ <unk> , indeed !
All this <unk> , <unk> <unk> IS very strange .
To see that composed court yesterday <unk> on so serenely and to think of the <unk> of the pieces on the board gave me the <unk> and the <unk> both together .
My head <unk> with wondering how it happened , if men were neither <unk> nor <unk> ; and my heart <unk> to think they could possibly be either .
But at all events , Ada — I may call you Ada ? ” “ Of course you may , cousin Richard . ” “ At all events , Chancery will work none of its bad influences on <unk> .
We have happily been brought together , thanks to our good kinsman , and it can ’ t <unk> us now ! ” “ Never , I hope , cousin Richard ! ” said Ada gently .
Miss Jellyby gave my arm a <unk> and me a very <unk> look .
I smiled in return , and we made the rest of the way back very pleasantly .
In half an hour after our arrival , Mrs. Jellyby appeared ; and in the course of an hour the various things necessary for breakfast <unk> one by one into the <unk> .
I do not doubt that Mrs. Jellyby had gone to bed and got up in the usual manner , but she presented no appearance of having changed her dress .
She was greatly occupied during breakfast , for the morning ’ s post brought a heavy correspondence relative to Borrioboola-Gha , which would occasion her ( she said ) to pass a busy day .
The children tumbled about , and <unk> <unk> of their <unk> in their legs , which were perfect little <unk> of distress ; and Peepy was lost for an hour and a half , and brought home from <unk> <unk> by a policeman .
The <unk> manner in which Mrs. Jellyby <unk> both his absence and his <unk> to the family circle surprised us all .
She was by that time <unk> <unk> to Caddy , and Caddy was fast relapsing into the inky condition in which we had found her .
At one o ’ clock an open carriage arrived for us , and a cart for our <unk> .
Mrs. Jellyby charged us with many remembrances to her good friend Mr. Jarndyce ; Caddy left her desk to see us depart , kissed me in the passage , and stood biting her pen and sobbing on the steps ; Peepy , I am happy to say , was asleep and spared the pain of separation ( I was not without <unk> that he had gone to <unk> <unk> in search of me ) ; and all the other children got up behind the <unk> and fell off , and we saw them , with great concern , scattered over the surface of Thavies Inn as we rolled out of its <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> Quite at Home The day had brightened very much , and still brightened as we went <unk> .
We went our way through the sunshine and the fresh air , wondering more and more at the extent of the streets , the <unk> of the shops , the great <unk> , and the <unk> of people whom the pleasanter weather seemed to have brought out like <unk> flowers .
By and by we began to leave the wonderful city and to proceed through <unk> which , of themselves , would have made a pretty large town in my eyes ; and at last we got into a real country road again , with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ’ <unk> , <unk> of old <unk> , swinging signs , and horse <unk> : trees , fields , and <unk> .
It was delightful to see the green landscape before us and the immense <unk> behind ; and when a waggon with a train of beautiful horses , furnished with red <unk> and <unk> bells , came by us with its music , I believe we could all three have <unk> to the bells , so cheerful were the influences around .
“ The whole road has been <unk> me of my <unk> <unk> , ” said Richard , “ and that waggon is the finishing touch .
<unk> !
What ’ s the matter ? ” We had stopped , and the waggon had stopped too .
Its music changed as the horses came to a stand , and <unk> to a gentle <unk> , except when a horse <unk> his head or shook himself and <unk> off a little shower of <unk> .
“ Our <unk> is looking after the waggoner , ” said Richard , “ and the waggoner is coming back after us .
Good day , friend ! ” The waggoner was at our <unk> .
“ Why , here ’ s an extraordinary thing ! ” added Richard , looking closely at the man .
“ He has got your name , Ada , in his hat ! ” He had all our names in his hat .
<unk> within the <unk> were three small notes — one addressed to Ada , one to Richard , one to me .
These the waggoner delivered to each of us <unk> , reading the name aloud first .
In answer to Richard ’ s inquiry from whom they came , he briefly answered , “ Master , sir , if you please ” ; and putting on his hat again ( which was like a soft <unk> ) , cracked his <unk> , <unk> his music , and went <unk> away .
“ Is that Mr. Jarndyce ’ s waggon ? ” said Richard , calling to our <unk> .
“ Yes , sir , ” he replied .
“ Going to London . ” We opened the notes .
<unk> was a <unk> of the other and contained these words in a <unk> , plain hand .
I look forward , my dear , to our meeting easily and without <unk> on either side .
I therefore have to propose that we meet as old friends and take the past for granted .
It will be a relief to you possibly , and to me certainly , and so my love to you .
John Jarndyce I had perhaps less reason to be surprised than either of my companions , having never yet enjoyed an opportunity of thanking one who had been my benefactor and sole earthly <unk> through so many years .
I had not considered how I could thank him , my gratitude lying too deep in my heart for that ; but I now began to consider how I could meet him without thanking him , and felt it would be very difficult indeed .
The notes revived in Richard and Ada a general impression that they both had , without quite knowing how they came by it , that their cousin Jarndyce could never bear <unk> for any kindness he performed and that sooner than receive any he would <unk> to the most singular <unk> and <unk> or would even run away .
Ada dimly remembered to have heard her mother tell , when she was a very little child , that he had once done her an act of uncommon generosity and that on her going to his house to thank him , he happened to see her through a window coming to the door , and immediately <unk> by the back gate , and was not heard of for three months .
This discourse led to a great deal more on the same theme , and indeed it lasted us all day , and we talked of scarcely anything else .
If we did by any chance <unk> into another subject , we soon returned to this , and wondered what the house would be like , and when we should get there , and whether we should see Mr. Jarndyce as soon as we arrived or after a delay , and what he would say to us , and what we should say to him .
All of which we wondered about , over and over again .
The roads were very heavy for the horses , but the <unk> was generally good , so we alighted and walked up all the hills , and liked it so well that we <unk> our walk on the level ground when we got to the top .
At <unk> there were other horses waiting for us , but as they had only just been <unk> , we had to wait for them too , and got a long fresh walk over a common and an old <unk> before the carriage came up .
These <unk> so <unk> the journey that the short day was spent and the long night had closed in before we came to St. Albans , near to which town Bleak House was , we knew .
By that time we were so anxious and nervous that even Richard confessed , as we rattled over the stones of the old street , to feeling an <unk> desire to drive back again .
As to Ada and me , whom he had wrapped up with great care , the night being sharp and frosty , we trembled from head to foot .
When we turned out of the town , round a corner , and Richard told us that the <unk> , who had for a long time <unk> with our <unk> expectation , was looking back and nodding , we both stood up in the carriage ( Richard holding Ada lest she should be <unk> down ) and <unk> round upon the open country and the <unk> night for our destination .
There was a light sparkling on the top of a hill before us , and the driver , pointing to it with his <unk> and crying , “ That ’ s Bleak House ! ” put his horses into a canter and took us forward at such a rate , <unk> though it was , that the wheels sent the road <unk> flying about our heads like <unk> from a <unk> .
Presently we lost the light , presently saw it , presently lost it , presently saw it , and turned into an avenue of trees and <unk> up towards where it was <unk> brightly .
It was in a window of what seemed to be an old-fashioned house with three <unk> in the roof in front and a <unk> sweep leading to the porch .
A bell was rung as we drew up , and <unk> the sound of its deep voice in the still air , and the distant <unk> of some dogs , and a <unk> of light from the opened door , and the smoking and <unk> of the <unk> horses , and the quickened beating of our own hearts , we alighted in no <unk> confusion .
“ Ada , my love , Esther , my dear , you are welcome .
I rejoice to see you !
Rick , if I had a hand to spare at present , I would give it you ! ” The gentleman who said these words in a clear , bright , hospitable voice had one of his arms round Ada ’ s waist and the other round mine , and kissed us both in a fatherly way , and bore us across the hall into a <unk> little room , all in a glow with a blazing fire .
Here he kissed us again , and opening his arms , made us sit down side by side on a sofa ready drawn out near the hearth .
I felt that if we had been at all <unk> , he would have run away in a moment .
“ Now , Rick ! ” said he .
“ I have a hand at liberty .
A word in earnest is as good as a speech .
I am heartily glad to see you .
You are at home .
<unk> yourself ! ” Richard shook him by both hands with an <unk> mixture of respect and <unk> , and only saying ( though with an earnestness that rather alarmed me , I was so afraid of Mr. Jarndyce ’ s suddenly <unk> ) , “ You are very kind , sir !
We are very much obliged to you ! ” laid aside his hat and coat and came up to the fire .
“ And how did you like the ride ?
And how did you like Mrs. Jellyby , my dear ? ” said Mr. Jarndyce to Ada .
While Ada was speaking to him in reply , I glanced ( I need not say with how much interest ) at his face .
It was a handsome , lively , quick face , full of change and motion ; and his hair was a <unk> <unk> .
I took him to be nearer <unk> than fifty , but he was upright , hearty , and <unk> .
From the moment of his first speaking to us his voice had connected itself with an association in my mind that I could not <unk> ; but now , all at once , a something sudden in his manner and a pleasant expression in his eyes recalled the gentleman in the <unk> six years ago on the memorable day of my journey to Reading .
I was certain it was he .
I never was so frightened in my life as when I made the discovery , for he caught my glance , and appearing to read my thoughts , gave such a look at the door that I thought we had lost him .
However , I am happy to say he remained where he was , and asked me what I thought of Mrs. Jellyby .
“ She <unk> herself very much for Africa , sir , ” I said .
“ <unk> ! ” returned Mr. Jarndyce .
“ But you answer like Ada . ” <unk> I had not heard .
“ You all think something else , I see . ” “ We rather thought , ” said I , glancing at Richard and Ada , who entreated me with their eyes to speak , “ that perhaps she was a little <unk> of her home . ” “ <unk> ! ” cried Mr. Jarndyce .
I was rather alarmed again .
“ Well !
I want to know your real thoughts , my dear .
I may have sent you there on purpose . ” “ We thought that , perhaps , ” said I , hesitating , “ it is right to begin with the obligations of home , sir ; and that , perhaps , while those are <unk> and neglected , no other duties can possibly be <unk> for them . ” “ The little <unk> , ” said Richard , coming to my relief , “ are really — I can ’ t help expressing myself strongly , sir — in a devil of a state . ” “ She means well , ” said Mr. Jarndyce hastily .
“ The wind ’ s in the east . ” “ It was in the north , sir , as we came down , ” observed Richard .
“ My dear Rick , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , <unk> the fire , “ I ’ ll take an oath it ’ s either in the east or going to be .
I am always conscious of an uncomfortable sensation now and then when the wind is blowing in the east . ” “ <unk> , sir ? ” said Richard .
“ I dare say it is , Rick .
I believe it is .
And so the little <unk> — I had my doubts about ’ em — are in a — oh , Lord , yes , it ’ s <unk> ! ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
He had taken two or three <unk> turns up and down while <unk> these broken <unk> , <unk> the <unk> in one hand and rubbing his hair with the other , with a <unk> vexation at once so <unk> and so <unk> that I am sure we were more delighted with him than we could possibly have expressed in any words .
He gave an arm to Ada and an arm to me , and <unk> Richard bring a candle , was leading the way out when he suddenly turned us all back again .
“ Those little <unk> .
<unk> ’ t you — didn ’ t you — now , if it had rained <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or anything of that sort ! ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ Oh , cousin — ” Ada hastily began .
“ Good , my pretty pet .
I like cousin .
Cousin John , perhaps , is better . ” “ Then , cousin John — ” Ada laughingly began again .
“ Ha , ha !
Very good indeed ! ” said Mr. Jarndyce with great enjoyment .
“ <unk> uncommonly natural .
Yes , my dear ? ” “ It did better than that .
It rained Esther . ” “ Aye ? ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ What did Esther do ? ” “ Why , cousin John , ” said Ada , <unk> her hands upon his arm and shaking her head at me across him — for I wanted her to be quiet — “ Esther was their friend directly .
Esther <unk> them , <unk> them to sleep , washed and dressed them , told them stories , kept them quiet , bought them <unk> ” — My dear girl !
I had only gone out with Peepy after he was found and given him a little , tiny horse ! — “ and , cousin John , she softened poor Caroline , the eldest one , so much and was so thoughtful for me and so amiable !
No , no , I won ’ t be <unk> , Esther dear !
You know , you know , it ’ s true ! ” The <unk> darling leaned across her cousin John and kissed me , and then looking up in his face , <unk> said , “ At all events , cousin John , I WILL thank you for the companion you have given me . ” I felt as if she <unk> him to run away .
But he didn ’ t .
“ Where did you say the wind was , Rick ? ” asked Mr. Jarndyce .
“ In the north as we came down , sir . ” “ You are right .
There ’ s no east in it .
A mistake of mine .
Come , girls , come and see your home ! ” It was one of those <unk> <unk> houses where you go up and down steps out of one room into another , and where you come upon more rooms when you think you have seen all there are , and where there is a <unk> <unk> of little <unk> and passages , and where you find still older <unk> in unexpected places with <unk> windows and green growth pressing through them .
Mine , which we entered first , was of this kind , with an <unk> roof that had more corners in it than I ever counted afterwards and a chimney ( there was a wood fire on the hearth ) <unk> all around with <unk> white <unk> , in every one of which a bright <unk> of the fire was blazing .
Out of this room , you went down two steps into a charming little sitting-room looking down upon a flower-garden , which room was henceforth to belong to Ada and me .
Out of this you went up three steps into Ada ’ s bedroom , which had a fine broad window commanding a beautiful view ( we saw a great <unk> of darkness lying underneath the stars ) , to which there was a hollow window-seat , in which , with a <unk> , three dear <unk> might have been lost at once .
Out of this room you passed into a little gallery , with which the other best rooms ( only two ) communicated , and so , by a little staircase of <unk> steps with a number of corner stairs in it , considering its length , down into the hall .
But if instead of going out at Ada ’ s door you came back into my room , and went out at the door by which you had entered it , and turned up a few crooked steps that <unk> off in an unexpected manner from the stairs , you lost yourself in passages , with <unk> in them , and <unk> tables , and a native <unk> chair , which was also a sofa , a box , and a bedstead , and looked in every form something between a <unk> skeleton and a great <unk> , and had been brought from India nobody knew by whom or when .
From these you came on Richard ’ s room , which was part library , part sitting-room , part bedroom , and seemed indeed a comfortable compound of many rooms .
Out of that you went straight , with a little interval of passage , to the plain room where Mr. Jarndyce slept , all the year round , with his window open , his bedstead without any furniture standing in the middle of the floor for more air , and his cold <unk> <unk> for him in a smaller room adjoining .
Out of that you came into another passage , where there were <unk> and where you could hear the horses being rubbed down outside the stable and being told to “ Hold up ” and “ Get over , ” as they slipped about very much on the <unk> stones .
Or you might , if you came out at another door ( every room had at least two doors ) , go straight down to the hall again by half-a-dozen steps and a low archway , wondering how you got back there or had ever got out of it .
The furniture , old-fashioned rather than old , like the house , was as pleasantly <unk> .
Ada ’ s <unk> was all flowers — in <unk> and paper , in velvet , in needlework , in the <unk> of two stiff courtly chairs which stood , each attended by a little page of a stool for greater state , on either side of the fire-place .
Our sitting-room was green and had <unk> and <unk> upon the walls <unk> of surprising and surprised birds , staring out of pictures at a real <unk> in a case , as brown and shining as if it had been served with gravy ; at the death of Captain Cook ; and at the whole process of preparing tea in China , as <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
In my room there were <unk> <unk> of the months — ladies <unk> in short <unk> and large <unk> tied under the chin , for <unk> ; <unk> <unk> pointing with <unk> to village <unk> , for <unk> .
<unk> portraits in <unk> <unk> all through the house , but were so dispersed that I found the brother of a youthful officer of mine in the <unk> and the grey old age of my pretty young bride , with a flower in her <unk> , in the <unk> .
As <unk> , I had four angels , of <unk> <unk> ’ s <unk> , taking a complacent gentleman to heaven , in <unk> , with some difficulty ; and a composition in needlework <unk> fruit , a <unk> , and an <unk> .
All the <unk> , from the <unk> to the chairs and tables , <unk> , glasses , even to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> variety .
They agreed in nothing but their perfect <unk> , their <unk> of the <unk> linen , and their <unk> , <unk> the existence of a drawer , small or large , rendered it possible , of <unk> of <unk> and sweet <unk> .
Such , with its <unk> windows , softened here and there by shadows of curtains , shining out upon the <unk> night ; with its light , and warmth , and comfort ; with its hospitable <unk> , at a distance , of preparations for dinner ; with the face of its generous master <unk> everything we saw ; and just wind enough without to sound a low <unk> to everything we heard , were our first impressions of Bleak House .
“ I am glad you like it , ” said Mr. Jarndyce when he had brought us round again to Ada ’ s sitting-room .
“ It makes no pretensions , but it is a comfortable little place , I hope , and will be more so with such bright young looks in it .
You have <unk> half an hour before dinner .
There ’ s no one here but the <unk> creature upon earth — a child . ” “ More children , Esther ! ” said Ada .
“ I don ’ t mean <unk> a child , ” pursued Mr. Jarndyce ; “ not a child in years .
He is grown up — he is at least as old as I am — but in simplicity , and <unk> , and enthusiasm , and a fine <unk> <unk> for all worldly affairs , he is a perfect child . ” We felt that he must be very interesting .
“ He knows Mrs. Jellyby , ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ He is a musical man , an amateur , but might have been a professional .
He is an artist too , an amateur , but might have been a professional .
He is a man of <unk> and of captivating manners .
He has been unfortunate in his affairs , and unfortunate in his pursuits , and unfortunate in his family ; but he don ’ t care — he ’ s a child ! ” “ Did you <unk> that he has children of his own , sir ? ” inquired Richard .
“ Yes , Rick !
<unk> .
More !
<unk> a dozen , I should think .
But he has never looked after them .
How could he ?
He wanted somebody to look after HIM .
He is a child , you know ! ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ And have the children looked after themselves at all , sir ? ” inquired Richard .
“ Why , just as you may suppose , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , his countenance suddenly falling .
“ It is said that the children of the very poor are not brought up , but dragged up .
Harold Skimpole ’ s children have tumbled up somehow or other .
The wind ’ s getting round again , I am afraid .
I feel it rather ! ” Richard observed that the situation was exposed on a sharp night .
“ It IS exposed , ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ No doubt that ’ s the cause .
Bleak House has an exposed sound .
But you are coming my way .
Come along ! ” Our <unk> having arrived and being all at hand , I was dressed in a few minutes and engaged in putting my worldly <unk> away when a maid ( not the one in attendance upon Ada , but another , whom I had not seen ) brought a basket into my room with two <unk> of keys in it , all <unk> .
“ For you , miss , if you please , ” said she .
“ For me ? ” said I.
“ The housekeeping keys , miss . ” I showed my surprise , for she added with some little surprise on her own part , “ I was told to bring them as soon as you was alone , miss .
Miss Summerson , if I don ’ t deceive myself ? ” “ Yes , ” said I.
“ That is my name . ” “ The large bunch is the housekeeping , and the little bunch is the <unk> , miss .
Any time you was pleased to <unk> to-morrow morning , I was to show you the <unk> and things they belong to . ” I said I would be ready at half-past six , and after she was gone , stood looking at the basket , quite lost in the <unk> of my trust .
Ada found me thus and had such a delightful confidence in me when I showed her the keys and told her about them that it would have been insensibility and <unk> not to feel encouraged .
I knew , to be sure , that it was the dear girl ’ s kindness , but I liked to be so pleasantly <unk> .
When we went downstairs , we were presented to Mr. Skimpole , who was standing before the fire telling Richard how fond he used to be , in his <unk> , of <unk> .
He was a little bright creature with a rather large head , but a delicate face and a sweet voice , and there was a perfect charm in him .
All he said was so free from effort and spontaneous and was said with such a captivating gaiety that it was fascinating to hear him talk .
Being of a more <unk> figure than Mr. Jarndyce and having a richer complexion , with <unk> hair , he looked younger .
Indeed , he had more the appearance in all respects of a <unk> young man than a <unk> <unk> one .
There was an easy <unk> in his manner and even in his dress ( his hair carelessly disposed , and his <unk> loose and <unk> , as I have seen <unk> <unk> their own portraits ) which I could not separate from the idea of a romantic youth who had <unk> some <unk> process of <unk> .
It struck me as being not at all like the manner or appearance of a man who had advanced in life by the usual road of years , cares , and experiences .
I gathered from the conversation that Mr. Skimpole had been educated for the medical profession and had once lived , in his professional capacity , in the household of a German <unk> .
He told us , however , that as he had always been a mere child in point of <unk> and <unk> and had never known anything about them ( except that they <unk> him ) , he had never been able to <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of detail .
In fact , he said , he had no head for detail .
And he told us , with great humour , that when he was wanted to <unk> the <unk> or <unk> any of his people , he was generally found lying on his back in bed , reading the newspapers or making <unk> in pencil , and couldn ’ t come .
The <unk> , at last , <unk> to this , “ in which , ” said Mr. Skimpole , in the <unk> manner , “ he was perfectly right , ” the engagement terminated , and Mr. Skimpole having ( as he added with delightful gaiety ) “ nothing to live upon but love , fell in love , and married , and surrounded himself with rosy cheeks . ” His good friend Jarndyce and some other of his good friends then helped him , in <unk> or <unk> succession , to several <unk> in life , but to no purpose , for he must confess to two of the oldest <unk> in the world : one was that he had no idea of time , the other that he had no idea of money .
In consequence of which he never kept an appointment , never could <unk> any business , and never knew the value of anything !
Well !
So he had got on in life , and here he was !
He was very fond of reading the papers , very fond of making <unk> with a pencil , very fond of nature , very fond of art .
All he asked of society was to let him live .
THAT wasn ’ t much .
His wants were few .
Give him the papers , conversation , music , mutton , coffee , landscape , fruit in the season , a few sheets of <unk> , and a little claret , and he asked no more .
He was a mere child in the world , but he didn ’ t cry for the moon .
He said to the world , “ Go your several ways in peace !
<unk> red coats , blue coats , <unk> sleeves ; put pens behind your ears , wear <unk> ; go after glory , <unk> , <unk> , trade , any object you prefer ; only — let Harold Skimpole live ! ” All this and a great deal more he told us , not only with the utmost <unk> and enjoyment , but with a certain vivacious candour — speaking of himself as if he were not at all his own affair , as if Skimpole were a third person , as if he knew that Skimpole had his <unk> but still had his claims too , which were the general business of the community and must not be <unk> .
He was quite <unk> .
If I felt at all confused at that early time in endeavouring to <unk> anything he said with anything I had thought about the duties and <unk> of life ( which I am far from sure of ) , I was confused by not exactly understanding why he was free of them .
That he WAS free of them , I scarcely doubted ; he was so very clear about it himself .
“ I <unk> nothing , ” said Mr. Skimpole in the same light way .
“ <unk> is nothing to me .
Here is my friend Jarndyce ’ s excellent house .
I feel obliged to him for possessing it .
I can <unk> it and <unk> it .
I can set it to music .
When I am here , I have sufficient possession of it and have neither trouble , cost , nor responsibility .
My steward ’ s name , in short , is Jarndyce , and he can ’ t <unk> me .
We have been mentioning Mrs. Jellyby .
There is a bright-eyed woman , of a strong will and immense power of business detail , who throws herself into objects with surprising ardour !
I don ’ t regret that I have not a strong will and an immense power of business detail to throw myself into objects with surprising ardour .
I can admire her without <unk> .
I can <unk> with the objects .
I can dream of them .
I can lie down on the grass — in fine weather — and <unk> along an African river , <unk> all the natives I meet , as sensible of the deep silence and <unk> the dense <unk> <unk> growth as <unk> as if I were there .
I don ’ t know that it ’ s of any direct use my doing so , but it ’ s all I can do , and I do it thoroughly .
Then , for heaven ’ s sake , having Harold Skimpole , a confiding child , <unk> you , the world , an <unk> of practical people of business habits , to let him live and admire the human family , do it somehow or other , like good <unk> , and suffer him to ride his <unk> ! ” It was plain enough that Mr. Jarndyce had not been <unk> of the <unk> .
Mr. Skimpole ’ s general position there would have rendered it so without the addition of what he presently said .
“ It ’ s only you , the generous creatures , whom I <unk> , ” said Mr. Skimpole , addressing us , his new friends , in an <unk> manner .
“ I <unk> you your power of doing what you do .
It is what I should <unk> in myself .
I don ’ t feel any <unk> gratitude to you .
I almost feel as if YOU ought to be grateful to ME for giving you the opportunity of enjoying the <unk> of generosity .
I know you like it .
For anything I can tell , I may have come into the world expressly for the purpose of increasing your stock of happiness .
I may have been born to be a benefactor to you by sometimes giving you an opportunity of assisting me in my little <unk> .
Why should I regret my <unk> for details and worldly affairs when it leads to such pleasant consequences ?
I don ’ t regret it therefore . ” Of all his playful <unk> ( playful , yet always fully meaning what they expressed ) none seemed to be more to the taste of Mr. Jarndyce than this .
I had often new <unk> , afterwards , to wonder whether it was really singular , or only singular to me , that he , who was probably the most grateful of mankind upon the least occasion , should so desire to escape the gratitude of others .
We were all enchanted .
I felt it a <unk> tribute to the engaging qualities of Ada and Richard that Mr. Skimpole , seeing them for the first time , should be so <unk> and should lay himself out to be so <unk> agreeable .
They ( and especially Richard ) were naturally pleased , for similar reasons , and considered it no common privilege to be so freely confided in by such an <unk> man .
The more we listened , the more gaily Mr. Skimpole talked .
And what with his fine <unk> manner and his engaging candour and his genial way of lightly <unk> his own weaknesses about , as if he had said , “ I am a child , you know !
You are <unk> people <unk> with me ” ( he really made me consider myself in that light ) “ but I am gay and innocent ; forget your worldly arts and play with me ! ” the effect was absolutely <unk> .
He was so full of feeling too and had such a delicate sentiment for what was beautiful or tender that he could have won a heart by that alone .
In the evening , when I was preparing to make tea and Ada was touching the piano in the adjoining room and softly <unk> a tune to her cousin Richard , which they had happened to mention , he came and sat down on the sofa near me and so spoke of Ada that I almost loved him .
“ She is like the morning , ” he said .
“ With that golden hair , those blue eyes , and that fresh bloom on her cheek , she is like the summer morning .
The birds here will mistake her for it .
We will not call such a lovely young creature as that , who is a joy to all mankind , an orphan .
She is the child of the <unk> . ” Mr. Jarndyce , I found , was standing near us with his hands behind him and an attentive smile upon his face .
“ The <unk> , ” he observed , “ makes rather an indifferent parent , I am afraid . ” “ Oh !
I don ’ t know ! ” cried Mr. Skimpole <unk> .
“ I think I do know , ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ Well ! ” cried Mr. Skimpole .
“ You know the world ( which in your sense is the <unk> ) , and I know nothing of it , so you shall have your way .
But if I had mine , ” glancing at the cousins , “ there should be no <unk> of <unk> <unk> in such a path as that .
It should be <unk> with roses ; it should lie through <unk> , where there was no spring , autumn , nor winter , but <unk> summer .
<unk> or change should never <unk> it .
The base word money should never be breathed near it ! ” Mr. Jarndyce patted him on the head with a smile , as if he had been really a child , and passing a step or two on , and stopping a moment , glanced at the young cousins .
His look was thoughtful , but had a benignant expression in it which I often ( how often ! )
saw again , which has long been <unk> on my heart .
The room in which they were , communicating with that in which he stood , was only lighted by the fire .
Ada sat at the piano ; Richard stood beside her , bending down .
Upon the wall , their shadows <unk> together , surrounded by strange forms , not without a ghostly motion caught from the <unk> fire , though <unk> from motionless objects .
Ada touched the notes so softly and <unk> so low that the wind , <unk> away to the distant hills , was as audible as the music .
The mystery of the future and the little clue <unk> to it by the voice of the present seemed expressed in the whole picture .
But it is not to recall this fancy , well as I remember it , that I recall the scene .
First , I was not quite unconscious of the contrast in respect of meaning and intention between the silent look directed that way and the <unk> of words that had preceded it .
Secondly , though Mr. Jarndyce ’ s glance as he withdrew it rested for but a moment on me , I felt as if in that moment he confided to me — and knew that he confided to me and that I received the confidence — his hope that Ada and Richard might one day enter on a <unk> relationship .
Mr. Skimpole could play on the piano and the <unk> , and he was a <unk> — had composed half an <unk> once , but got tired of it — and played what he composed with taste .
After tea we had quite a little <unk> , in which Richard — who was <unk> by Ada ’ s singing and told me that she seemed to know all the songs that ever were written — and Mr. Jarndyce , and I were the audience .
After a little while I missed first Mr. Skimpole and afterwards Richard , and while I was thinking how could Richard stay away so long and lose so much , the maid who had given me the keys looked in at the door , saying , “ If you please , miss , could you spare a minute ? ” When I was shut out with her in the hall , she said , holding up her hands , “ Oh , if you please , miss , Mr. Carstone says would you come upstairs to Mr. Skimpole ’ s room .
He has been took , miss ! ” “ Took ? ” said I.
“ Took , miss .
<unk> , ” said the maid .
I was apprehensive that his illness might be of a dangerous kind , but of course I begged her to be quiet and not disturb any one and collected myself , as I followed her quickly upstairs , sufficiently to consider what were the best <unk> to be applied if it should prove to be a fit .
She threw open a door and I went into a chamber , where , to my unspeakable surprise , instead of finding Mr. Skimpole stretched upon the bed or <unk> on the floor , I found him standing before the fire smiling at Richard , while Richard , with a face of great embarrassment , looked at a person on the sofa , in a white <unk> , with smooth hair upon his head and not much of it , which he was wiping <unk> and making less of with a <unk> .
“ Miss Summerson , ” said Richard hurriedly , “ I am glad you are come .
You will be able to advise us .
Our friend Mr. Skimpole — don ’ t be alarmed ! — is arrested for debt . ” “ And really , my dear Miss Summerson , ” said Mr. Skimpole with his agreeable candour , “ I never was in a situation in which that excellent sense and quiet habit of <unk> and <unk> , which anybody must observe in you who has the happiness of being a quarter of an hour in your society , was more needed . ” The person on the sofa , who appeared to have a cold in his head , gave such a very loud <unk> that he startled me .
“ Are you arrested for much , sir ? ” I inquired of Mr. Skimpole .
“ My dear Miss Summerson , ” said he , shaking his head pleasantly , “ I don ’ t know .
Some pounds , odd shillings , and halfpence , I think , were mentioned . ” “ It ’ s <unk> pound , <unk> , and <unk> ha ’ penny , ” observed the stranger .
“ That ’ s wot it is . ” “ And it sounds — somehow it sounds , ” said Mr. Skimpole , “ like a small sum ? ” The strange man said nothing but made another <unk> .
It was such a powerful one that it seemed quite to lift him out of his seat .
“ Mr.
Skimpole , ” said Richard to me , “ has a delicacy in <unk> to my cousin Jarndyce because he has lately — I think , sir , I understood you that you had lately — ” “ Oh , yes ! ” returned Mr. Skimpole , smiling .
“ Though I forgot how much it was and when it was .
Jarndyce would readily do it again , but I have the <unk> feeling that I would prefer a novelty in help , that I would rather , ” and he looked at Richard and me , “ <unk> generosity in a new <unk> and in a new form of flower . ” “ What do you think will be best , Miss Summerson ? ” said Richard , aside .
I ventured to inquire , generally , before replying , what would happen if the money were not produced .
“ <unk> , ” said the strange man , coolly putting his handkerchief into his hat , which was on the floor at his feet .
“ Or Coavinses . ” “ May I ask , sir , what is — ” “ Coavinses ? ” said the strange man .
“ A ’ ouse . ” Richard and I looked at one another again .
It was a most singular thing that the <unk> was our embarrassment and not Mr. Skimpole ’ s .
He observed us with a genial interest , but there seemed , if I may venture on such a <unk> , nothing selfish in it .
He had entirely washed his hands of the difficulty , and it had become ours .
“ I thought , ” he suggested , as if <unk> to help us out , “ that being parties in a Chancery suit concerning ( as people say ) a large amount of property , Mr. Richard or his beautiful cousin , or both , could sign something , or make over something , or give some sort of undertaking , or <unk> , or bond ?
I don ’ t know what the business name of it may be , but I suppose there is some instrument within their power that would settle this ? ” “ Not a bit on it , ” said the strange man .
“ Really ? ” returned Mr. Skimpole .
“ That seems odd , now , to one who is no judge of these things ! ” “ <unk> or even , ” said the stranger <unk> , “ I tell you , not a bit on it ! ” “ <unk> your temper , my good fellow , keep your temper ! ” Mr. Skimpole gently <unk> with him as he made a little drawing of his head on the <unk> of a book .
“ Don ’ t be ruffled by your occupation .
We can separate you from your office ; we can separate the individual from the pursuit .
We are not so <unk> as to suppose that in private life you are otherwise than a very <unk> man , with a great deal of poetry in your nature , of which you may not be conscious . ” The stranger only answered with another violent <unk> , whether in acceptance of the <unk> or in disdainful <unk> of it , he did not express to me .
“ Now , my dear Miss Summerson , and my dear Mr. Richard , ” said Mr. Skimpole gaily , innocently , and <unk> as he looked at his drawing with his head on one side , “ here you see me utterly incapable of helping myself , and entirely in your hands !
I only ask to be free .
The <unk> are free .
<unk> will surely not deny to Harold Skimpole what it <unk> to the <unk> ! ” “ My dear Miss Summerson , ” said Richard in a whisper , “ I have ten pounds that I received from Mr. Kenge .
I must try what that will do . ” I possessed fifteen pounds , odd shillings , which I had saved from my <unk> allowance during several years .
I had always thought that some accident might happen which would throw me suddenly , without any relation or any property , on the world and had always tried to keep some little money by me that I might not be quite <unk> .
I told Richard of my having this little <unk> and having no present need of it , and I asked him delicately to inform Mr. Skimpole , while I should be gone to fetch it , that we would have the pleasure of paying his debt .
When I came back , Mr. Skimpole kissed my hand and seemed quite touched .
Not on his own account ( I was again aware of that <unk> and extraordinary <unk> ) , but on ours , as if personal considerations were impossible with him and the contemplation of our happiness alone affected him .
Richard , begging me , for the greater grace of the transaction , as he said , to settle with Coavinses ( as Mr. Skimpole now <unk> called him ) , I counted out the money and received the necessary acknowledgment .
This , too , delighted Mr. Skimpole .
His compliments were so delicately <unk> that I <unk> less than I might have done and settled with the stranger in the white coat without making any mistakes .
He put the money in his pocket and shortly said , “ Well , then , I ’ ll wish you a good evening , miss . ” “ My friend , ” said Mr. Skimpole , standing with his back to the fire after giving up the <unk> when it was half finished , “ I should like to ask you something , without offence . ” I think the reply was , “ <unk> away , then ! ” “ Did you know this morning , now , that you were coming out on this errand ? ” said Mr. Skimpole .
“ <unk> ’ d it yes ’ day <unk> ’ noon at <unk> , ” said Coavinses .
“ It didn ’ t <unk> your appetite ?
<unk> ’ t make you at all uneasy ? ” “ Not a bit , ” said Coavinses .
“ I know ’ d if you wos missed to-day , you wouldn ’ t be missed to-morrow .
A day makes no such odds . ” “ But when you came down here , ” proceeded Mr. Skimpole , “ it was a fine day .
The sun was shining , the wind was blowing , the lights and shadows were passing across the fields , the birds were singing . ” “ Nobody said they warn ’ t , in MY hearing , ” returned Coavinses .
“ No , ” observed Mr. Skimpole .
“ But what did you think upon the road ? ” “ <unk> do you mean ? ” <unk> Coavinses with an appearance of strong <unk> .
“ Think !
I ’ ve got enough to do , and little enough to get for it without thinking .
<unk> ! ” ( with profound contempt ) .
“ Then you didn ’ t think , at all events , ” proceeded Mr. Skimpole , “ to this effect : ‘ Harold Skimpole loves to see the sun shine , loves to hear the wind blow , loves to watch the changing lights and shadows , loves to hear the birds , those <unk> in Nature ’ s great <unk> .
And does it seem to me that I am about to <unk> Harold Skimpole of his share in such <unk> , which are his only <unk> ! ’ You thought nothing to that effect ? ” “ I — certainly — did — NOT , ” said Coavinses , whose <unk> in utterly <unk> the idea was of that intense kind that he could only give <unk> expression to it by putting a long interval between each word , and <unk> the last with a <unk> that might have <unk> his neck .
“ Very odd and very curious , the mental process is , in you men of business ! ” said Mr. Skimpole thoughtfully .
“ Thank you , my friend .
Good night . ” As our absence had been long enough already to seem strange downstairs , I returned at once and found Ada sitting at work by the fireside talking to her cousin John .
Mr. Skimpole presently appeared , and Richard shortly after him .
I was sufficiently engaged during the remainder of the evening in taking my first lesson in <unk> from Mr. Jarndyce , who was very fond of the game and from whom I wished of course to learn it as quickly as I could in order that I might be of the very small use of being able to play when he had no better <unk> .
But I thought , occasionally , when Mr. Skimpole played some fragments of his own <unk> or when , both at the piano and the <unk> , and at our table , he preserved with an absence of all effort his delightful spirits and his easy <unk> of conversation , that Richard and I seemed to retain the <unk> impression of having been arrested since dinner and that it was very curious altogether .
It was late before we separated , for when Ada was going at eleven o ’ clock , Mr. Skimpole went to the piano and rattled <unk> that the best of all ways to <unk> our days was to steal a few hours from night , my dear !
It was past twelve before he took his candle and his radiant face out of the room , and I think he might have kept us there , if he had seen fit , until <unk> .
Ada and Richard were lingering for a few moments by the fire , wondering whether Mrs. Jellyby had yet finished her <unk> for the day , when Mr. Jarndyce , who had been out of the room , returned .
“ Oh , dear me , what ’ s this , what ’ s this ! ” he said , rubbing his head and walking about with his good-humoured vexation .
“ What ’ s this they tell me ?
Rick , my boy , Esther , my dear , what have you been doing ?
Why did you do it ?
How could you do it ?
How much <unk> was it ?
The wind ’ s round again .
I feel it all over me ! ” We neither of us quite knew what to answer .
“ Come , Rick , come !
I must settle this before I sleep .
How much are you out of pocket ?
You two made the money up , you know !
Why did you ?
How could you ?
Oh , Lord , yes , it ’ s due east — must be ! ” “ Really , sir , ” said Richard , “ I don ’ t think it would be honourable in me to tell you .
Mr. Skimpole <unk> upon us — ” “ Lord bless you , my dear boy !
He <unk> upon everybody ! ” said Mr. Jarndyce , giving his head a great rub and stopping short .
“ Indeed , sir ? ” “ Everybody !
And he ’ ll be in the same scrape again next week ! ” said Mr. Jarndyce , walking again at a great pace , with a candle in his hand that had gone out .
“ He ’ s always in the same scrape .
He was born in the same scrape .
I <unk> believe that the announcement in the newspapers when his mother was confined was ‘ On <unk> last , at her residence in <unk> <unk> , Mrs. Skimpole of a son in difficulties . ’ ” Richard laughed heartily but added , “ Still , sir , I don ’ t want to shake his confidence or to break his confidence , and if I submit to your better knowledge again , that I ought to keep his secret , I hope you will consider before you press me any more .
Of course , if you do press me , sir , I shall know I am wrong and will tell you . ” “ Well ! ” cried Mr. Jarndyce , stopping again , and making several absent endeavours to put his <unk> in his pocket .
“ I — here !
Take it away , my dear .
I don ’ t know what I am about with it ; it ’ s all the wind — invariably has that effect — I won ’ t press you , Rick ; you may be right .
But really — to get hold of you and Esther — and to <unk> you like a couple of tender young Saint <unk> ’ s <unk> !
It ’ ll blow a <unk> in the course of the night ! ” He was now <unk> putting his hands into his pockets as if he were going to keep them there a long time , and taking them out again and <unk> rubbing them all over his head .
I ventured to take this opportunity of <unk> that Mr. Skimpole , being in all such matters quite a child — “ Eh , my dear ? ” said Mr. Jarndyce , catching at the word .
“ Being quite a child , sir , ” said I , “ and so different from other people — ” “ You are right ! ” said Mr. Jarndyce , <unk> .
“ Your woman ’ s wit <unk> the mark .
He is a child — an <unk> child .
I told you he was a child , you know , when I first mentioned him . ” Certainly !
Certainly !
we said .
“ And he IS a child .
Now , isn ’ t he ? ” asked Mr. Jarndyce , <unk> more and more .
He was indeed , we said .
“ When you come to think of it , it ’ s the height of <unk> in you — I mean me — ” said Mr. Jarndyce , “ to regard him for a moment as a man .
You can ’ t make HIM responsible .
The idea of Harold Skimpole with <unk> or plans , or knowledge of consequences !
Ha , ha , ha ! ” It was so delicious to see the clouds about his bright face <unk> , and to see him so heartily pleased , and to know , as it was impossible not to know , that the source of his pleasure was the goodness which was <unk> by <unk> , or <unk> , or secretly <unk> any one , that I saw the tears in Ada ’ s eyes , while she echoed his laugh , and felt them in my own .
“ Why , what a <unk> ’ s head and shoulders I am , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , “ to require <unk> of it !
The whole business shows the child from beginning to end .
Nobody but a child would have thought of <unk> YOU two out for parties in the affair !
Nobody but a child would have thought of YOUR having the money !
If it had been a thousand pounds , it would have been just the same ! ” said Mr. Jarndyce with his whole face in a glow .
We all confirmed it from our night ’ s experience .
“ To be sure , to be sure ! ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ However , Rick , Esther , and you too , Ada , for I don ’ t know that even your little purse is safe from his <unk> — I must have a promise all round that nothing of this sort shall ever be done any more .
No advances !
Not even <unk> . ” We all promised faithfully , Richard with a merry glance at me touching his pocket as if to remind me that there was no danger of <unk> <unk> .
“ As to Skimpole , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , “ a <unk> doll ’ s house with good board and a few tin people to get into debt with and borrow money of would set the boy up in life .
He is in a child ’ s sleep by this time , I suppose ; it ’ s time I should take my <unk> head to my more worldly pillow .
Good night , my dears .
God bless you ! ” He <unk> in again , with a smiling face , before we had lighted our candles , and said , “ Oh !
I have been looking at the <unk> .
I find it was a false alarm about the wind .
It ’ s in the <unk> ! ” And went away singing to himself .
Ada and I agreed , as we talked together for a little while upstairs , that this <unk> about the wind was a fiction and that he used the pretence to account for any disappointment he could not conceal , rather than he would blame the real cause of it or disparage or <unk> any one .
We thought this very <unk> of his eccentric gentleness and of the difference between him and those <unk> people who make the weather and the winds ( particularly that <unk> wind which he had chosen for such a different purpose ) the <unk> of their <unk> and gloomy <unk> .
Indeed , so much affection for him had been added in this one evening to my gratitude that I hoped I already began to understand him through that mingled feeling .
Any seeming <unk> in Mr. Skimpole or in Mrs. Jellyby I could not expect to be able to <unk> , having so little experience or practical knowledge .
Neither did I try , for my thoughts were busy when I was alone , with Ada and Richard and with the confidence I had seemed to receive concerning them .
My fancy , made a little wild by the wind perhaps , would not consent to be all <unk> , either , though I would have persuaded it to be so if I could .
It wandered back to my godmother ’ s house and came along the <unk> track , raising up shadowy <unk> which had sometimes trembled there in the dark as to what knowledge Mr. Jarndyce had of my <unk> history — even as to the possibility of his being my father , though that idle dream was quite gone now .
It was all gone now , I remembered , getting up from the fire .
It was not for me to <unk> over <unk> , but to act with a cheerful spirit and a grateful heart .
So I said to myself , “ Esther , Esther , Esther !
<unk> , my dear ! ” and gave my little basket of housekeeping keys such a shake that they sounded like little bells and rang me hopefully to bed .
CHAPTER <unk> The Ghost ’ s Walk While Esther <unk> , and while Esther <unk> , it is still wet weather down at the place in Lincolnshire .
The rain is ever falling — drip , drip , drip — by day and night upon the broad <unk> <unk> , the Ghost ’ s Walk .
The weather is so very bad down in Lincolnshire that the <unk> imagination can scarcely <unk> its ever being fine again .
Not that there is any <unk> life of imagination on the spot , for Sir Leicester is not here ( and , truly , even if he were , would not do much for it in that particular ) , but is in Paris with my Lady ; and <unk> , with <unk> wings , sits <unk> upon Chesney Wold .
There may be some motions of fancy among the lower <unk> at Chesney Wold .
The horses in the stables — the long stables in a <unk> , <unk> court-yard , where there is a great bell in a <unk> , and a clock with a large face , which the <unk> who live near it and who love to <unk> upon its shoulders seem to be always consulting — THEY may contemplate some mental pictures of fine weather on occasions , and may be better <unk> at them than the <unk> .
The old <unk> , so famous for <unk> work , turning his large <unk> to the <unk> window near his <unk> , may remember the fresh leaves that <unk> there at other times and the <unk> that stream in , and may have a fine run with the <unk> , while the human <unk> , <unk> out the next <unk> , never stirs beyond his <unk> and <unk> .
The grey , whose place is opposite the door and who with an impatient rattle of his <unk> <unk> his ears and turns his head so <unk> when it is opened , and to whom the <unk> says , “ <unk> grey , then , steady !
<unk> wants you to-day ! ” may know it quite as well as the man .
The whole <unk> monotonous and <unk> <unk> , <unk> together , may pass the long wet hours when the door is shut in <unk> communication than is held in the servants ’ hall or at the Dedlock Arms , or may even <unk> the time by improving ( perhaps <unk> ) the pony in the <unk> in the corner .
So the <unk> , <unk> in his <unk> in the court-yard with his large head on his <unk> , may think of the hot sunshine when the shadows of the <unk> tire his patience out by changing and leave him at one time of the day no <unk> refuge than the shadow of his own house , where he sits on end , panting and <unk> short , and very much wanting something to <unk> besides himself and his chain .
So now , <unk> and <unk> , he may recall the house full of company , the <unk> full of vehicles , the stables full of horses , and the <unk> full of <unk> upon horses , until he is <unk> about the present and comes forth to see how it is .
Then , with that impatient shake of himself , he may <unk> in the spirit , “ <unk> , rain , rain !
Nothing but rain — and no family here ! ” as he goes in again and lies down with a gloomy <unk> .
So with the dogs in the <unk> across the park , who have their restless fits and whose <unk> voices when the wind has been very obstinate have even made it known in the house itself — upstairs , downstairs , and in my Lady ’ s chamber .
They may <unk> the whole <unk> , while the <unk> are <unk> round their <unk> .
So the <unk> with their <unk> <unk> , <unk> in and out of <unk> at <unk> of trees , may be lively with ideas of the <unk> days when their ears are blown about or of those seasons of interest when there are sweet young plants to <unk> .
The <unk> in the <unk> , always troubled with a <unk> ( probably <unk> ) , may be <unk> of that summer morning <unk> taken from him when he got into the lane among the <unk> trees , where there was a <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> , who <unk> to pass under the old gateway , twenty feet high , may <unk> out , if we only knew it , a <unk> <unk> for weather when the gateway casts its shadow on the ground .
Be this as it may , there is not much fancy otherwise stirring at Chesney Wold .
If there be a little at any odd moment , it goes , like a little noise in that old echoing place , a long way and usually leads off to ghosts and mystery .
It has rained so hard and rained so long down in Lincolnshire that Mrs. Rouncewell , the old housekeeper at Chesney Wold , has several times taken off her spectacles and <unk> them to make certain that the drops were not upon the glasses .
Mrs. Rouncewell might have been sufficiently assured by hearing the rain , but that she is rather deaf , which nothing will induce her to believe .
She is a fine old lady , handsome , stately , wonderfully neat , and has such a back and such a stomacher that if her <unk> should turn out when she dies to have been a broad old-fashioned family <unk> , nobody who knows her would have cause to be surprised .
<unk> <unk> Mrs. Rouncewell little .
The house is there in all <unk> , and the house , as she expresses it , “ is what she looks at . ” She sits in her room ( in a side passage on the ground floor , with an arched window commanding a smooth <unk> , <unk> at regular intervals with smooth round trees and smooth round <unk> of stone , as if the trees were going to play at <unk> with the stones ) , and the whole house <unk> on her mind .
She can open it on occasion and be busy and fluttered , but it is shut up now and lies on the breadth of Mrs. Rouncewell ’ s <unk> bosom in a majestic sleep .
It is the next difficult thing to an <unk> to imagine Chesney Wold without Mrs. Rouncewell , but she has only been here fifty years .
Ask her how long , this <unk> day , and she shall answer “ fifty year , three months , and a fortnight , by the blessing of heaven , if I live till <unk> . ” Mr. Rouncewell died some time before the <unk> of the pretty fashion of <unk> , and modestly hid his own ( if he took it with him ) in a corner of the churchyard in the park near the <unk> porch .
He was born in the <unk> , and so was his young widow .
Her progress in the family began in the time of the last Sir Leicester and originated in the <unk> .
The present representative of the Dedlocks is an excellent master .
He supposes all his <unk> to be utterly <unk> of individual <unk> , intentions , or opinions , and is persuaded that he was born to <unk> the necessity of their having any .
If he were to make a discovery to the contrary , he would be simply <unk> — would never recover himself , most likely , except to gasp and die .
But he is an excellent master still , holding it a part of his state to be so .
He has a great liking for Mrs. Rouncewell ; he says she is a most respectable , <unk> woman .
He always shakes hands with her when he comes down to Chesney Wold and when he goes away ; and if he were very ill , or if he were knocked down by accident , or run over , or placed in any situation expressive of a Dedlock at a disadvantage , he would say if he could speak , “ <unk> me , and send Mrs. Rouncewell here ! ” feeling his dignity , at such a pass , <unk> with her than with anybody else .
Mrs. Rouncewell has known trouble .
She has had two <unk> , of whom the younger ran wild , and went for a soldier , and never came back .
Even to this hour , Mrs. Rouncewell ’ s calm hands lose their composure when she speaks of him , and <unk> themselves from her stomacher , <unk> about her in an <unk> manner as she says what a likely lad , what a fine lad , what a gay , good-humoured , clever lad he was !
Her second son would have been provided for at Chesney Wold and would have been made steward in due season , but he took , when he was a <unk> , to <unk> <unk> out of <unk> and setting birds to draw their own water with the least possible amount of <unk> , so assisting them with artful <unk> of <unk> <unk> that a <unk> <unk> had only , in a literal sense , to put his shoulder to the wheel and the job was done .
This <unk> gave Mrs. Rouncewell great uneasiness .
She felt it with a mother ’ s <unk> to be a move in the Wat Tyler direction , well knowing that Sir Leicester had that general impression of an <unk> for any art to which smoke and a tall chimney might be considered essential .
But the <unk> young <unk> ( otherwise a mild youth , and very <unk> ) , showing no sign of grace as he got older but , on the contrary , <unk> a model of a <unk> , she was <unk> , with many tears , to mention his <unk> to the baronet .
“ Mrs.
Rouncewell , ” said Sir Leicester , “ I can never consent to <unk> , as you know , with any one on any subject .
You had better get rid of your boy ; you had better get him into some <unk> .
The iron country farther north is , I suppose , the congenial direction for a boy with these <unk> . ” <unk> north he went , and farther north he grew up ; and if Sir Leicester Dedlock ever saw him when he came to Chesney Wold to visit his mother , or ever thought of him afterwards , it is certain that he only regarded him as one of a body of some odd thousand <unk> , <unk> and grim , who were in the habit of turning out by <unk> two or three nights in the week for <unk> purposes .
Nevertheless , Mrs. Rouncewell ’ s son has , in the course of nature and art , grown up , and established himself , and married , and called unto him Mrs. Rouncewell ’ s grandson , who , being out of his <unk> , and home from a journey in far <unk> , <unk> he was sent to <unk> his knowledge and complete his preparations for the venture of this life , stands leaning against the chimney-piece this very day in Mrs. Rouncewell ’ s room at Chesney Wold .
“ And , again and again , I am glad to see you , Watt !
And , once again , I am glad to see you , Watt ! ” says Mrs. Rouncewell .
“ You are a fine young fellow .
You are like your poor uncle George .
Ah ! ” Mrs. Rouncewell ’ s hands <unk> , as usual , on this reference .
“ They say I am like my father , grandmother . ” “ Like him , also , my dear — but most like your poor uncle George !
And your dear father . ” Mrs. Rouncewell folds her hands again .
“ He is well ? ” “ <unk> , grandmother , in every way . ” “ I am thankful ! ” Mrs. Rouncewell is fond of her son but has a plaintive feeling towards him , much as if he were a very honourable soldier who had gone over to the enemy .
“ He is quite happy ? ” says she .
“ Quite . ” “ I am thankful !
So he has brought you up to follow in his ways and has sent you into foreign <unk> and the like ?
Well , he knows best .
There may be a world beyond Chesney Wold that I don ’ t understand .
Though I am not young , either .
And I have seen a quantity of good company too ! ” “ <unk> , ” says the young man , changing the subject , “ what a very pretty girl that was I found with you just now .
You called her Rosa ? ” “ Yes , child .
She is daughter of a widow in the village .
<unk> are so hard to teach , <unk> , that I have put her about me young .
She ’ s an apt <unk> and will do well .
She shows the house already , very pretty .
She lives with me at my table here . ” “ I hope I have not driven her away ? ” “ She supposes we have family affairs to speak about , I dare say .
She is very modest .
It is a fine quality in a young woman .
And <unk> , ” says Mrs. Rouncewell , <unk> her stomacher to its utmost limits , “ than it formerly was ! ” The young man inclines his head in acknowledgment of the <unk> of experience .
Mrs. Rouncewell listens .
“ <unk> ! ” says she .
They have long been audible to the younger ears of her companion .
“ What wheels on such a day as this , for gracious sake ? ” After a short interval , a tap at the door .
“ Come in ! ” A <unk> , <unk> , shy , village beauty comes in — so fresh in her rosy and yet delicate bloom that the drops of rain which have beaten on her hair look like the <unk> upon a flower fresh gathered .
“ What company is this , Rosa ? ” says Mrs. Rouncewell .
“ It ’ s two young men in a gig , ma ’ am , who want to see the house — yes , and if you please , I told them so ! ” in quick reply to a gesture of <unk> from the housekeeper .
“ I went to the <unk> and told them it was the wrong day and the wrong hour , but the young man who was <unk> took off his hat in the wet and begged me to bring this card to you . ” “ <unk> it , my dear Watt , ” says the housekeeper .
Rosa is so shy as she gives it to him that they drop it between them and almost knock their <unk> together as they <unk> it up .
Rosa is <unk> than before .
“ Mr.
Guppy ” is all the information the card <unk> .
“ Guppy ! ” repeats Mrs. Rouncewell , “ <unk>
Guppy !
<unk> , I never heard of him ! ” “ If you please , he told ME that ! ” says Rosa .
“ But he said that he and the other young gentleman came from London only last night by the <unk> , on business at the <unk> ’ meeting , ten miles off , this morning , and that as their business was soon over , and they had heard a great deal said of Chesney Wold , and really didn ’ t know what to do with themselves , they had come through the wet to see it .
They are lawyers .
He says he is not in Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s office , but he is sure he may make use of Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s name if necessary . ” <unk> , now she leaves off , that she has been making quite a long speech , Rosa is <unk> than ever .
Now , Mr. Tulkinghorn is , in a manner , part and <unk> of the place , and besides , is supposed to have made Mrs. Rouncewell ’ s will .
The old lady <unk> , <unk> to the admission of the visitors as a favour , and <unk> Rosa .
The grandson , however , being <unk> by a sudden wish to see the house himself , proposes to join the party .
The grandmother , who is pleased that he should have that interest , accompanies him — though to do him justice , he is exceedingly unwilling to trouble her .
“ Much obliged to you , ma ’ am ! ” says Mr. Guppy , <unk> himself of his wet <unk> in the hall .
“ <unk> London lawyers don ’ t often get an out , and when we do , we like to make the most of it , you know . ” The old housekeeper , with a gracious severity of deportment , <unk> her hand towards the great staircase .
Mr. Guppy and his friend follow Rosa ; Mrs. Rouncewell and her grandson follow them ; a young gardener goes before to open the shutters .
As is usually the case with people who go over houses , Mr. Guppy and his friend are dead beat before they have well begun .
They <unk> about in wrong places , look at wrong things , don ’ t care for the right things , <unk> when more rooms are opened , <unk> profound <unk> of spirits , and are clearly knocked up .
In each <unk> chamber that they enter , Mrs. Rouncewell , who is as upright as the house itself , rests apart in a window-seat or other such <unk> and listens with stately approval to Rosa ’ s <unk> .
Her grandson is so attentive to it that Rosa is <unk> than ever — and <unk> .
Thus they pass on from room to room , raising the <unk> Dedlocks for a few brief minutes as the young gardener admits the light , and <unk> them to their graves as he shuts it out again .
It appears to the afflicted Mr. Guppy and his <unk> friend that there is no end to the Dedlocks , whose family greatness seems to <unk> in their never having done anything to <unk> themselves for seven hundred years .
Even the long drawing-room of Chesney Wold cannot <unk> Mr. Guppy ’ s spirits .
He is so low that he <unk> on the threshold and has hardly strength of mind to enter .
But a portrait over the chimney-piece , painted by the fashionable artist of the day , <unk> upon him like a charm .
He recovers in a moment .
He stares at it with uncommon interest ; he seems to be fixed and <unk> by it .
“ Dear me ! ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ Who ’ s that ? ” “ The picture over the fire-place , ” says Rosa , “ is the portrait of the present Lady Dedlock .
It is considered a perfect likeness , and the best work of the master . ” “ <unk> , ” says Mr. Guppy , staring in a kind of <unk> at his friend , “ if I can ever have seen her .
Yet I know her !
Has the picture been <unk> , miss ? ” “ The picture has never been <unk> .
Sir Leicester has always refused permission . ” “ Well ! ” says Mr. Guppy in a low voice .
“ I ’ ll be shot if it ain ’ t very curious how well I know that picture !
So that ’ s Lady Dedlock , is it ! ” “ The picture on the right is the present Sir Leicester Dedlock .
The picture on the left is his father , the late Sir Leicester . ” Mr. Guppy has no eyes for either of these <unk> .
“ It ’ s unaccountable to me , ” he says , still staring at the portrait , “ how well I know that picture !
I ’ m dashed , ” adds Mr. Guppy , looking round , “ if I don ’ t think I must have had a dream of that picture , you know ! ” As no one present takes any <unk> interest in Mr. Guppy ’ s <unk> , the probability is not pursued .
But he still remains so absorbed by the portrait that he stands immovable before it until the young gardener has closed the shutters , when he comes out of the room in a <unk> state that is an odd though a sufficient <unk> for interest and follows into the <unk> rooms with a confused stare , as if he were looking everywhere for Lady Dedlock again .
He sees no more of her .
He sees her rooms , which are the last shown , as being very elegant , and he looks out of the windows from which she looked out , not long ago , upon the weather that bored her to death .
All things have an end , even houses that people take infinite pains to see and are tired of before they begin to see them .
He has come to the end of the sight , and the fresh village beauty to the end of her description ; which is always this : “ The terrace below is much admired .
It is called , from an old story in the family , the Ghost ’ s Walk . ” “ No ? ” says Mr. Guppy , <unk> curious .
“ What ’ s the story , miss ?
Is it anything about a picture ? ” “ Pray tell us the story , ” says Watt in a half whisper .
“ I don ’ t know it , sir . ” Rosa is <unk> than ever .
“ It is not related to visitors ; it is almost forgotten , ” says the housekeeper , advancing .
“ It has never been more than a family <unk> . ” “ You ’ ll excuse my asking again if it has anything to do with a picture , ma ’ am , ” observes Mr. Guppy , “ because I do assure you that the more I think of that picture the better I know it , without knowing how I know it ! ” The story has nothing to do with a picture ; the housekeeper can <unk> that .
Mr. Guppy is obliged to her for the information and is , <unk> , generally obliged .
He retires with his friend , guided down another staircase by the young gardener , and presently is heard to drive away .
It is now dusk .
Mrs. Rouncewell can trust to the <unk> of her two young <unk> and may tell <unk> how the terrace came to have that ghostly name .
She seats herself in a large chair by the <unk> window and tells them : “ In the wicked days , my dears , of King Charles the First — I mean , of course , in the wicked days of the <unk> who <unk> themselves against that excellent king — Sir <unk> Dedlock was the owner of Chesney Wold .
Whether there was any account of a ghost in the family before those days , I can ’ t say .
I should think it very likely indeed . ” Mrs. Rouncewell holds this opinion because she considers that a family of such <unk> and importance has a right to a ghost .
She regards a ghost as one of the <unk> of the upper classes , a genteel distinction to which the common people have no claim .
“ Sir <unk> Dedlock , ” says Mrs. Rouncewell , “ was , I have no occasion to say , on the side of the blessed <unk> .
But it IS supposed that his Lady , who had none of the family blood in her <unk> , favoured the bad cause .
It is said that she had relations among King Charles ’ s enemies , that she was in correspondence with them , and that she gave them information .
When any of the country gentlemen who followed his <unk> ’ s cause met here , it is said that my Lady was always nearer to the door of their <unk> than they supposed .
Do you hear a sound like a <unk> passing along the terrace , Watt ? ” Rosa draws nearer to the housekeeper .
“ I hear the <unk> on the stones , ” replies the young man , “ and I hear a curious echo — I suppose an echo — which is very like a <unk> step . ” The housekeeper gravely nods and continues : “ <unk> on account of this <unk> between them , and partly on other accounts , Sir <unk> and his Lady led a troubled life .
She was a lady of a haughty temper .
They were not well suited to each other in age or character , and they had no children to <unk> between them .
After her favourite brother , a young gentleman , was killed in the <unk> <unk> ( by Sir <unk> ’ s near kinsman ) , her feeling was so violent that she <unk> the race into which she had married .
When the Dedlocks were about to ride out from Chesney Wold in the king ’ s cause , she is supposed to have more than once <unk> down into the stables in the dead of night and <unk> their horses ; and the story is that once at such an hour , her husband saw her gliding down the stairs and followed her into the <unk> where his own favourite horse stood .
There he seized her by the <unk> , and in a struggle or in a fall or through the horse being frightened and <unk> out , she was <unk> in the <unk> and from that hour began to <unk> away . ” The housekeeper has dropped her voice to a little more than a whisper .
“ She had been a lady of a handsome figure and a noble carriage .
She never complained of the change ; she never spoke to any one of being <unk> or of being in pain , but day by day she tried to walk upon the terrace , and with the help of the stone <unk> , went up and down , up and down , up and down , in sun and shadow , with greater difficulty every day .
At last , one afternoon her husband ( to whom she had never , on any <unk> , opened her lips since that night ) , standing at the great <unk> window , saw her drop upon the pavement .
He <unk> down to raise her , but she <unk> him as he bent over her , and looking at him fixedly and <unk> , said , ‘ I will die here where I have walked .
And I will walk here , though I am in my grave .
I will walk here until the pride of this house is <unk> .
And when calamity or when disgrace is coming to it , let the Dedlocks listen for my step ! ’ ” Watt looks at Rosa .
Rosa in the <unk> gloom looks down upon the ground , half frightened and half shy .
“ There and then she died .
And from those days , ” says Mrs. Rouncewell , “ the name has come down — the Ghost ’ s Walk .
If the tread is an echo , it is an echo that is only heard after dark , and is often <unk> for a long while together .
But it comes back from time to time ; and so sure as there is <unk> or death in the family , it will be heard then . ” “ And disgrace , grandmother — ” says Watt .
“ <unk> never comes to Chesney Wold , ” returns the housekeeper .
Her grandson <unk> with “ True .
True . ” “ That is the story .
Whatever the sound is , it is a <unk> sound , ” says Mrs. Rouncewell , getting up from her chair ; “ and what is to be noticed in it is that it MUST BE <unk> .
My Lady , who is afraid of nothing , admits that when it is there , it must be heard .
You cannot shut it out .
Watt , there is a tall French clock behind you ( placed there , ’ a purpose ) that has a loud beat when it is in motion and can play music .
You understand how those things are <unk> ? ” “ Pretty well , grandmother , I think . ” “ <unk> it a-going . ” Watt sets it a-going — music and all .
“ Now , come <unk> , ” says the housekeeper .
“ <unk> , child , towards my Lady ’ s pillow .
I am not sure that it is dark enough yet , but listen !
Can you hear the sound upon the terrace , through the music , and the beat , and everything ? ” “ I certainly can ! ” “ So my Lady says . ” CHAPTER <unk> <unk> a <unk> of <unk> It was interesting when I dressed before daylight to peep out of window , where my candles were reflected in the black <unk> like two <unk> , and finding all beyond still <unk> in the <unk> of last night , to watch how it turned out when the day came on .
As the prospect gradually revealed itself and <unk> the scene over which the wind had wandered in the dark , like my memory over my life , I had a pleasure in discovering the unknown objects that had been around me in my sleep .
At first they were faintly <unk> in the mist , and above them the later stars still <unk> .
That pale interval over , the picture began to <unk> and fill up so fast that at every new peep I could have found enough to look at for an hour .
<unk> my candles became the only <unk> part of the morning , the dark places in my room all melted away , and the day shone bright upon a cheerful landscape , prominent in which the old <unk> <unk> , with its massive tower , threw a <unk> train of shadow on the view than seemed <unk> with its <unk> character .
But so from rough <unk> ( I hope I have learnt ) , serene and gentle influences often proceed .
Every part of the house was in such order , and every one was so attentive to me , that I had no trouble with my two <unk> of keys , though what with trying to remember the contents of each little <unk> drawer and cupboard ; and what with making notes on a slate about <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and bottles , and glass , and <unk> , and a great many other things ; and what with being generally a <unk> , <unk> sort of foolish little person , I was so busy that I could not believe it was <unk> when I heard the bell ring .
<unk> I ran , however , and made tea , as I had already been <unk> into the responsibility of the <unk> ; and then , as they were all rather late and nobody was down yet , I thought I would take a peep at the garden and get some knowledge of that too .
I found it quite a delightful place — in front , the pretty avenue and drive by which we had approached ( and where , by the by , we had cut up the <unk> so <unk> with our wheels that I asked the gardener to roll it ) ; at the back , the flower-garden , with my darling at her window up there , throwing it open to smile out at me , as if she would have kissed me from that distance .
<unk> the flower-garden was a <unk> , and then a <unk> , and then a <unk> little <unk> , and then a dear little <unk> .
As to the house itself , with its three <unk> in the roof ; its <unk> windows , some so large , some so small , and all so pretty ; its <unk> , against the <unk> for roses and <unk> , and its homely , comfortable , <unk> look — it was , as Ada said when she came out to meet me with her arm through that of its master , worthy of her cousin John , a bold thing to say , though he only pinched her dear cheek for it .
Mr. Skimpole was as agreeable at breakfast as he had been <unk> .
There was honey on the table , and it led him into a discourse about <unk> .
He had no objection to honey , he said ( and I should think he had not , for he seemed to like it ) , but he <unk> against the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
He didn ’ t at all see why the busy bee should be proposed as a model to him ; he supposed the bee liked to make honey , or he wouldn ’ t do it — nobody asked him .
It was not necessary for the bee to make such a merit of his tastes .
If every <unk> went <unk> about the world <unk> against everything that came in his way and <unk> calling upon everybody to take notice that he was going to his work and must not be interrupted , the world would be quite an <unk> place .
Then , after all , it was a ridiculous position to be smoked out of your fortune with brimstone as soon as you had made it .
You would have a very mean opinion of a <unk> man if he <unk> <unk> for no other purpose .
He must say he thought a <unk> the <unk> of a pleasanter and wiser idea .
The <unk> said <unk> , “ You will excuse me ; I really cannot attend to the shop !
I find myself in a world in which there is so much to see and so short a time to see it in that I must take the liberty of looking about me and begging to be provided for by somebody who <unk> ’ t want to look about him . ” This appeared to Mr. Skimpole to be the <unk> philosophy , and he thought it a very good philosophy , always supposing the <unk> to be willing to be on good terms with the bee , which , so far as he knew , the easy fellow always was , if the <unk> creature would only let him , and not be so <unk> about his honey !
He pursued this fancy with the <unk> foot over a variety of ground and made us all merry , though again he seemed to have as serious a meaning in what he said as he was capable of having .
I left them still listening to him when I withdrew to attend to my new duties .
They had occupied me for some time , and I was passing through the passages on my return with my basket of keys on my arm when Mr. Jarndyce called me into a small room next his <unk> , which I found to be in part a little library of books and papers and in part quite a little <unk> of his boots and shoes and <unk> .
“ Sit down , my dear , ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ This , you must know , is the growlery .
When I am out of humour , I come and <unk> here . ” “ You must be here very seldom , sir , ” said I.
“ Oh , you don ’ t know me ! ” he returned .
“ When I am <unk> or disappointed in — the wind , and it ’ s <unk> , I take refuge here .
The growlery is the <unk> room in the house .
You are not aware of half my <unk> yet .
My dear , how you are trembling ! ” I could not help it ; I tried very hard , but being alone with that benevolent presence , and meeting his kind eyes , and feeling so happy and so honoured there , and my heart so full — I kissed his hand .
I don ’ t know what I said , or even that I spoke .
He was disconcerted and walked to the window ; I almost believed with an intention of <unk> out , until he turned and I was reassured by seeing in his eyes what he had gone there to hide .
He gently patted me on the head , and I sat down .
“ There !
There ! ” he said .
“ That ’ s over .
<unk> !
Don ’ t be foolish . ” “ It shall not happen again , sir , ” I returned , “ but at first it is difficult — ” “ <unk> ! ” he said .
“ It ’ s easy , easy .
Why not ?
I hear of a good little orphan girl without a <unk> , and I take it into my head to be that <unk> .
She <unk> up , and more than <unk> my good opinion , and I remain her guardian and her friend .
What is there in all this ?
So , so !
Now , we have cleared off old scores , and I have before me thy pleasant , trusting , <unk> face again . ” I said to myself , “ Esther , my dear , you surprise me !
This really is not what I expected of you ! ” And it had such a good effect that I folded my hands upon my basket and quite recovered myself .
Mr. Jarndyce , expressing his approval in his face , began to talk to me as confidentially as if I had been in the habit of <unk> with him every morning for I don ’ t know how long .
I almost felt as if I had .
“ Of course , Esther , ” he said , “ you don ’ t understand this Chancery business ? ” And of course I shook my head .
“ I don ’ t know who does , ” he returned .
“ The lawyers have twisted it into such a state of <unk> that the original merits of the case have long disappeared from the face of the earth .
It ’ s about a will and the trusts under a will — or it was once .
It ’ s about nothing but costs now .
We are always appearing , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and arguing , and <unk> , and <unk> , and referring , and <unk> , and revolving about the Lord Chancellor and all his <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ourselves off to dusty death , about costs .
That ’ s the great question .
All the rest , by some extraordinary means , has melted away . ” “ But it was , sir , ” said I , to bring him back , for he began to rub his head , “ about a will ? ” “ Why , yes , it was about a will when it was about anything , ” he returned .
“ A certain Jarndyce , in an evil hour , made a great fortune , and made a great will .
In the question how the trusts under that will are to be <unk> , the fortune left by the will is <unk> away ; the <unk> under the will are <unk> to such a miserable condition that they would be sufficiently punished if they had committed an <unk> crime in having money left them , and the will itself is made a dead letter .
All through the <unk> cause , everything that everybody in it , except one man , knows already is referred to that only one man who don ’ t know , it to find out — all through the <unk> cause , everybody must have copies , over and over again , of everything that has <unk> about it in the way of <unk> of papers ( or must pay for them without having them , which is the usual course , for nobody wants them ) and must go down the middle and up again through such an infernal <unk> of costs and fees and nonsense and <unk> as was never dreamed of in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> ’ s <unk> .
Equity sends questions to law , law sends questions back to equity ; law finds it can ’ t do this , equity finds it can ’ t do that ; neither can so much as say it can ’ t do anything , without this solicitor <unk> and this counsel appearing for A , and that solicitor <unk> and that counsel appearing for <unk> ; and so on through the whole <unk> , like the history of the <unk> <unk> .
And thus , through years and years , and lives and lives , everything goes on , constantly beginning over and over again , and nothing ever ends .
And we can ’ t get out of the suit on any terms , for we are made parties to it , and MUST BE parties to it , whether we like it or not .
But it won ’ t do to think of it !
When my great uncle , poor Tom Jarndyce , began to think of it , it was the beginning of the end ! ” “ The Mr. Jarndyce , sir , whose story I have heard ? ” He nodded gravely .
“ I was his <unk> , and this was his house , Esther .
When I came here , it was <unk> indeed .
He had left the signs of his misery upon it . ” “ How changed it must be now ! ” I said .
“ It had been called , before his time , the <unk> .
He gave it its present name and lived here shut up , day and night <unk> over the wicked heaps of papers in the suit and hoping against hope to <unk> it from its <unk> and bring it to a close .
In the meantime , the place became <unk> , the wind <unk> through the cracked walls , the rain fell through the broken roof , the <unk> <unk> the passage to the <unk> door .
When I brought what remained of him home here , the brains seemed to me to have been blown out of the house too , it was so shattered and ruined . ” He walked a little to and fro after saying this to himself with a shudder , and then looked at me , and brightened , and came and sat down again with his hands in his pockets .
“ I told you this was the growlery , my dear .
Where was I ? ” I reminded him , at the hopeful change he had made in Bleak House .
“ Bleak House ; true .
There is , in that city of London there , some property of ours which is much at this day what Bleak House was then ; I say property of ours , meaning of the suit ’ s , but I ought to call it the property of costs , for costs is the only power on earth that will ever get anything out of it now or will ever know it for anything but an <unk> and a <unk> .
It is a street of <unk> blind houses , with their eyes <unk> out , without a <unk> of glass , without so much as a <unk> , with the bare blank shutters tumbling from their <unk> and falling <unk> , the iron <unk> <unk> away in <unk> of <unk> , the chimneys sinking in , the stone steps to every door ( and every door might be death ’ s door ) turning stagnant green , the very <unk> on which the ruins are <unk> decaying .
Although Bleak House was not in Chancery , its master was , and it was <unk> with the same seal .
These are the Great Seal ’ s impressions , my dear , all over England — the children know them ! ” “ How changed it is ! ” I said again .
“ Why , so it is , ” he answered much more cheerfully ; “ and it is wisdom in you to keep me to the bright side of the picture . ” ( The idea of my wisdom ! )
“ These are things I never talk about or even think about , excepting in the growlery here .
If you consider it right to mention them to Rick and Ada , ” looking seriously at me , “ you can .
I leave it to your <unk> , Esther . ” “ I hope , sir — ” said I.
“ I think you had better call me guardian , my dear . ” I felt that I was choking again — I <unk> myself with it , “ Esther , now , you know you are ! ” — when he <unk> to say this slightly , as if it were a <unk> instead of a thoughtful tenderness .
But I gave the housekeeping keys the least shake in the world as a <unk> to myself , and folding my hands in a still more determined manner on the basket , looked at him quietly .
“ I hope , guardian , ” said I , “ that you may not trust too much to my <unk> .
I hope you may not mistake me .
I am afraid it will be a disappointment to you to know that I am not clever , but it really is the truth , and you would soon find it out if I had not the <unk> to confess it . ” He did not seem at all disappointed ; quite the contrary .
He told me , with a smile all over his face , that he knew me very well indeed and that I was quite clever enough for him .
“ I hope I may turn out so , ” said I , “ but I am much afraid of it , guardian . ” “ You are clever enough to be the good little woman of our lives here , my dear , ” he returned <unk> ; “ the little old woman of the child ’ s ( I don ’ t mean Skimpole ’ s ) <unk> : “ ‘ Little old woman , and <unk> so high ? ’ ‘ To sweep the <unk> out of the sky . ’ ” “ You will sweep them so neatly out of <unk> sky in the course of your housekeeping , Esther , that one of these days we shall have to abandon the growlery and <unk> up the door . ” This was the beginning of my being called Old <unk> , and Little Old <unk> , and <unk> , and Mrs. <unk> , and Mother <unk> , and Dame Durden , and so many names of that sort that my own name soon became quite lost among them .
“ However , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , “ to return to our <unk> .
Here ’ s Rick , a fine young fellow full of promise .
What ’ s to be done with him ? ” Oh , my goodness , the idea of asking my advice on such a point !
“ Here he is , Esther , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , comfortably putting his hands into his pockets and <unk> out his legs .
“ He must have a profession ; he must make some choice for himself .
There will be a world more <unk> about it , I suppose , but it must be done . ” “ More what , guardian ? ” said I.
“ More <unk> , ” said he .
“ It ’ s the only name I know for the thing .
He is a ward in Chancery , my dear .
Kenge and Carboy will have something to say about it ; Master Somebody — a sort of ridiculous <unk> , <unk> graves for the merits of causes in a back room at the end of <unk> Court , Chancery Lane — will have something to say about it ; counsel will have something to say about it ; the Chancellor will have something to say about it ; the <unk> will have something to say about it ; they will all have to be handsomely fee ’ d , all round , about it ; the whole thing will be <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and expensive , and I call it , in general , <unk> .
How mankind ever came to be afflicted with <unk> , or for whose sins these young people ever fell into a pit of it , I don ’ t know ; so it is . ” He began to rub his head again and to hint that he felt the wind .
But it was a delightful instance of his kindness towards me that whether he rubbed his head , or walked about , or did both , his face was sure to recover its benignant expression as it looked at mine ; and he was sure to turn comfortable again and put his hands in his pockets and stretch out his legs .
“ Perhaps it would be best , first of all , ” said I , “ to ask Mr. Richard what he inclines to himself . ” “ <unk> so , ” he returned .
“ That ’ s what I mean !
You know , just <unk> yourself to talk it over , with your tact and in your quiet way , with him and Ada , and see what you all make of it .
We are sure to come at the heart of the matter by your means , little woman . ” I really was frightened at the thought of the importance I was <unk> and the number of things that were being confided to me .
I had not meant this at all ; I had meant that he should speak to Richard .
But of course I said nothing in reply except that I would do my best , though I feared ( I really felt it necessary to repeat this ) that he thought me much more sagacious than I was .
At which my guardian only laughed the pleasantest laugh I ever heard .
“ Come ! ” he said , rising and pushing back his chair .
“ I think we may have done with the growlery for one day !
Only a <unk> word .
Esther , my dear , do you wish to ask me anything ? ” He looked so attentively at me that I looked attentively at him and felt sure I understood him .
“ About myself , sir ? ” said I.
“ Yes . ” “ Guardian , ” said I , <unk> to put my hand , which was suddenly <unk> than I could have wished , in his , “ nothing !
I am quite sure that if there were anything I ought to know or had any need to know , I should not have to ask you to tell it to me .
If my whole reliance and confidence were not placed in you , I must have a hard heart indeed .
I have nothing to ask you , nothing in the world . ” He drew my hand through his arm and we went away to look for Ada .
From that hour I felt quite easy with him , quite <unk> , quite content to know no more , quite happy .
We lived , at first , rather a busy life at Bleak House , for we had to become acquainted with many <unk> in and out of the neighbourhood who knew Mr. Jarndyce .
It seemed to Ada and me that everybody knew him who wanted to do anything with anybody else ’ s money .
It amazed us when we began to sort his letters and to answer some of them for him in the growlery of a morning to find how the great object of the lives of nearly all his <unk> appeared to be to form themselves into committees for getting in and laying out money .
The ladies were as desperate as the gentlemen ; indeed , I think they were even more so .
They threw themselves into committees in the most <unk> manner and collected <unk> with a vehemence quite extraordinary .
It appeared to us that some of them must pass their whole lives in dealing out <unk> to the whole post-office <unk> — shilling cards , half-crown cards , <unk> cards , penny cards .
They wanted everything .
They wanted wearing <unk> , they wanted linen rags , they wanted money , they wanted <unk> , they wanted <unk> , they wanted interest , they wanted <unk> , they wanted <unk> , they wanted whatever Mr. Jarndyce had — or had not .
Their objects were as various as their demands .
They were going to raise new buildings , they were going to pay off <unk> on old buildings , they were going to establish in a <unk> building ( <unk> of proposed west <unk> attached ) the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , they were going to give a <unk> to Mrs. Jellyby , they were going to have their <unk> ’ s portrait painted and presented to his <unk> , whose deep devotion to him was well known , they were going to get up everything , I really believe , from five hundred thousand <unk> to an <unk> and from a <unk> monument to a silver <unk> .
They took a <unk> of titles .
They were the <unk> of England , the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> of all the <unk> virtues <unk> , the <unk> of America , the <unk> of a hundred <unk> .
They appeared to be always excited about <unk> and <unk> .
They seemed to our poor wits , and according to their own accounts , to be constantly <unk> people by tens of thousands , yet never bringing their <unk> in for anything .
It made our heads ache to think , on the whole , what <unk> lives they must lead .
Among the ladies who were most distinguished for this <unk> benevolence ( if I may use the expression ) was a Mrs. Pardiggle , who seemed , as I <unk> from the number of her letters to Mr. Jarndyce , to be almost as powerful a <unk> as Mrs. Jellyby herself .
We observed that the wind always changed when Mrs. Pardiggle became the subject of conversation and that it invariably interrupted Mr. Jarndyce and prevented his going any farther , when he had remarked that there were two classes of charitable people ; one , the people who did a little and made a great deal of noise ; the other , the people who did a great deal and made no noise at all .
We were therefore curious to see Mrs. Pardiggle , <unk> her to be a <unk> of the former class , and were glad when she called one day with her five young <unk> .
She was a <unk> style of lady with spectacles , a prominent nose , and a loud voice , who had the effect of wanting a great deal of room .
And she really did , for she knocked down little chairs with her skirts that were quite a great way off .
As only Ada and I were at home , we received her timidly , for she seemed to come in like cold weather and to make the little <unk> blue as they followed .
“ These , young ladies , ” said Mrs. Pardiggle with great <unk> after the first <unk> , “ are my five boys .
You may have seen their names in a printed <unk> list ( perhaps more than one ) in the possession of our esteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce .
<unk> , my eldest ( twelve ) , is the boy who sent out his <unk> , to the amount of five and <unk> , to the <unk> Indians .
<unk> , my second ( ten and a half ) , is the child who <unk> two and <unk> to the Great <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , my third ( nine ) , one and sixpence <unk> ; <unk> , my <unk> ( seven ) , <unk> to the <unk> <unk> ; <unk> , my youngest ( five ) , has <unk> <unk> himself in the <unk> <unk> of Joy , and is <unk> never , through life , to use tobacco in any form . ” We had never seen such <unk> children .
It was not merely that they were <unk> and <unk> — though they were certainly that too — but they looked absolutely ferocious with <unk> .
At the mention of the <unk> Indians , I could really have supposed <unk> to be one of the most <unk> members of that <unk> , he gave me such a <unk> frown .
The face of each child , as the amount of his <unk> was mentioned , darkened in a <unk> <unk> manner , but his was by far the worst .
I must except , however , the little <unk> into the <unk> <unk> of Joy , who was <unk> and <unk> miserable .
“ You have been <unk> , I understand , ” said Mrs. Pardiggle , “ at Mrs. Jellyby ’ s ? ” We said yes , we had passed one night there .
“ Mrs.
Jellyby , ” pursued the lady , always speaking in the same <unk> , loud , hard tone , so that her voice impressed my fancy as if it had a sort of spectacles on too — and I may take the opportunity of <unk> that her spectacles were made the less engaging by her eyes being what Ada called “ choking eyes , ” meaning very prominent — “ Mrs.
Jellyby is a benefactor to society and <unk> a helping hand .
My boys have <unk> to the African project — <unk> , one and six , being the <unk> allowance of nine weeks ; <unk> , one and a penny <unk> , being the same ; the rest , according to their little means .
Nevertheless , I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in all things .
I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in her treatment of her young family .
It has been noticed .
It has been observed that her young family are <unk> from <unk> in the objects to which she is devoted .
She may be right , she may be wrong ; but , right or wrong , this is not my course with MY young family .
I take them everywhere . ” I was afterwards convinced ( and so was Ada ) that from the <unk> eldest child , these words <unk> a sharp <unk> .
He turned it off into a <unk> , but it began as a <unk> .
“ They attend <unk> with me ( very <unk> done ) at half-past six o ’ clock in the morning all the year round , including of course the <unk> of winter , ” said Mrs. Pardiggle rapidly , “ and they are with me during the revolving duties of the day .
I am a <unk> lady , I am a <unk> lady , I am a Reading lady , I am a <unk> lady ; I am on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and many general committees ; and my <unk> alone is very <unk> — perhaps no one ’ s more so .
But they are my companions everywhere ; and by these means they <unk> that knowledge of the poor , and that capacity of doing charitable business in general — in short , that taste for the sort of thing — which will render them in after life a service to their neighbours and a satisfaction to themselves .
My young family are not <unk> ; they <unk> the <unk> amount of their allowance in <unk> , under my direction ; and they have attended as many public <unk> and listened to as many lectures , <unk> , and <unk> as generally fall to the lot of few grown people .
<unk> ( five ) , who , as I mentioned , has of his own <unk> joined the <unk> <unk> of Joy , was one of the very few children who <unk> consciousness on that occasion after a <unk> address of two hours from the <unk> of the evening . ” <unk> <unk> at us as if he never could , or would , forgive the injury of that night .
“ You may have observed , Miss Summerson , ” said Mrs. Pardiggle , “ in some of the <unk> to which I have referred , in the possession of our esteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce , that the names of my young family are concluded with the name of <unk>
<unk> Pardiggle , <unk> , one pound .
That is their father .
We usually observe the same <unk> .
I put down my mite first ; then my young family <unk> their <unk> , according to their ages and their little means ; and then Mr. Pardiggle brings up the <unk> .
Mr. Pardiggle is happy to throw in his limited <unk> , under my direction ; and thus things are made not only pleasant to ourselves , but , we trust , improving to others . ” Suppose Mr. Pardiggle were to dine with Mr. Jellyby , and suppose Mr. Jellyby were to <unk> his mind after dinner to Mr. Pardiggle , would Mr. Pardiggle , in return , make any confidential communication to Mr. Jellyby ?
I was quite confused to find myself thinking this , but it came into my head .
“ You are very pleasantly situated here ! ” said Mrs. Pardiggle .
We were glad to change the subject , and going to the window , pointed out the <unk> of the prospect , on which the spectacles appeared to me to rest with curious indifference .
“ You know Mr. Gusher ? ” said our visitor .
We were obliged to say that we had not the pleasure of Mr. Gusher ’ s acquaintance .
“ The loss is yours , I assure you , ” said Mrs. Pardiggle with her commanding deportment .
“ He is a very <unk> , <unk> <unk> — full of fire !
<unk> in a waggon on this <unk> , now , which , from the shape of the land , is naturally adapted to a public meeting , he would improve almost any occasion you could mention for hours and hours !
By this time , young ladies , ” said Mrs. Pardiggle , moving back to her chair and <unk> , as if by <unk> <unk> , a little round table at a considerable distance with my <unk> on it , “ by this time you have found me out , I dare say ? ” This was really such a <unk> question that Ada looked at me in perfect <unk> .
As to the guilty nature of my own consciousness after what I had been thinking , it must have been expressed in the colour of my cheeks .
“ <unk> out , I mean , ” said Mrs. Pardiggle , “ the prominent point in my character .
I am aware that it is so prominent as to be <unk> immediately .
I lay myself open to <unk> , I know .
Well !
I freely admit , I am a woman of business .
I love hard work ; I enjoy hard work .
The excitement does me good .
I am so accustomed and <unk> to hard work that I don ’ t know what fatigue is . ” We murmured that it was very astonishing and very gratifying , or something to that effect .
I don ’ t think we knew what it was either , but this is what our politeness expressed .
“ I do not understand what it is to be tired ; you cannot tire me if you try ! ” said Mrs. Pardiggle .
“ The quantity of exertion ( which is no exertion to me ) , the amount of business ( which I regard as nothing ) , that I go through sometimes <unk> myself .
I have seen my young family , and Mr. Pardiggle , quite worn out with <unk> it , when I may truly say I have been as fresh as a <unk> ! ” If that <unk> eldest boy could look more <unk> than he had already looked , this was the time when he did it .
I observed that he <unk> his right <unk> and delivered a secret blow into the crown of his cap , which was under his left arm .
“ This gives me a great advantage when I am making my <unk> , ” said Mrs. Pardiggle .
“ If I find a person unwilling to hear what I have to say , I tell that person directly , ‘ I am incapable of fatigue , my good friend , I am never tired , and I mean to go on until I have done . ’ It answers <unk> !
Miss Summerson , I hope I shall have your assistance in my <unk> <unk> immediately , and Miss Clare ’ s very soon . ” At first I tried to excuse myself for the present on the general ground of having <unk> to attend to which I must not <unk> .
But as this was an <unk> protest , I then said , more particularly , that I was not sure of my <unk> .
That I was <unk> in the art of <unk> my mind to minds very <unk> situated , and addressing them from suitable points of view .
That I had not that delicate knowledge of the heart which must be essential to such a work .
That I had much to learn , myself , before I could teach others , and that I could not confide in my good intentions alone .
For these reasons I thought it best to be as useful as I could , and to render what kind services I could to those immediately about me , and to try to let that circle of duty gradually and naturally <unk> itself .
All this I said with anything but confidence , because Mrs. Pardiggle was much older than I , and had great experience , and was so very military in her manners .
“ You are wrong , Miss Summerson , ” said she , “ but perhaps you are not equal to hard work or the excitement of it , and that makes a vast difference .
If you would like to see how I go through my work , I am now about — with my young family — to visit a brickmaker in the neighbourhood ( a very bad character ) and shall be glad to take you with me .
Miss Clare also , if she will do me the favour . ” Ada and I <unk> looks , and as we were going out in any case , accepted the offer .
When we hastily returned from putting on our bonnets , we found the young family <unk> in a corner and Mrs. Pardiggle sweeping about the room , knocking down nearly all the light objects it contained .
Mrs. Pardiggle took possession of Ada , and I followed with the family .
Ada told me afterwards that Mrs. Pardiggle talked in the same loud tone ( that , indeed , I overheard ) all the way to the brickmaker ’ s about an <unk> <unk> which she had for two or three years <unk> against another lady relative to the bringing in of their <unk> <unk> for a <unk> somewhere .
There had been a quantity of <unk> , and promising , and <unk> , and <unk> , and it appeared to have imparted great <unk> to all concerned , except the <unk> — who were not <unk> yet .
I am very fond of being confided in by children and am happy in being usually favoured in that respect , but on this occasion it gave me great uneasiness .
As soon as we were out of doors , <unk> , with the manner of a little <unk> , <unk> a shilling of me on the ground that his <unk> was “ <unk> ” from him .
On my pointing out the great <unk> of the word , especially in connexion with his parent ( for he added <unk> “ By her ! ” ) , he pinched me and said , “ Oh , then !
Now !
Who are you !
YOU wouldn ’ t like it , I think ?
What does she make a <unk> for , and pretend to give me money , and take it away again ?
Why do you call it my allowance , and never let me spend it ? ” These <unk> questions so <unk> his mind and the minds of <unk> and <unk> that they all pinched me at once , and in a dreadfully <unk> way — <unk> up such little pieces of my arms that I could hardly <unk> crying out .
<unk> , at the same time , <unk> upon my <unk> .
And the <unk> of Joy , who on account of always having the whole of his little income anticipated stood in fact <unk> to <unk> from <unk> as well as tobacco , so swelled with grief and rage when we passed a <unk> ’ s shop that he <unk> me by becoming <unk> .
I never <unk> so much , both in body and mind , in the course of a walk with young people as from these <unk> constrained children when they paid me the compliment of being natural .
I was glad when we came to the brickmaker ’ s house , though it was one of a <unk> of wretched <unk> in a <unk> , with <unk> close to the broken windows and miserable little <unk> before the doors growing nothing but stagnant <unk> .
Here and there an old tub was put to catch the <unk> of <unk> from a roof , or they were <unk> up with mud into a little <unk> like a large <unk> .
At the doors and windows some men and women <unk> or <unk> about , and took little notice of us except to laugh to one another or to say something as we passed about <unk> minding their own business and not <unk> their heads and <unk> their shoes with coming to look after other people ’ s .
Mrs. Pardiggle , leading the way with a great show of moral determination and talking with much <unk> about the untidy habits of the people ( though I doubted if the best of us could have been tidy in such a place ) , conducted us into a cottage at the <unk> corner , the <unk> room of which we nearly filled .
Besides ourselves , there were in this damp , offensive room a woman with a black eye , nursing a poor little <unk> baby by the fire ; a man , all stained with <unk> and mud and looking very <unk> , lying at full length on the ground , smoking a pipe ; a powerful young man <unk> a collar on a dog ; and a bold girl doing some kind of washing in very dirty water .
They all looked up at us as we came in , and the woman seemed to turn her face towards the fire as if to hide her <unk> eye ; nobody gave us any welcome .
“ Well , my friends , ” said Mrs. Pardiggle , but her voice had not a friendly sound , I thought ; it was much too business-like and <unk> .
“ How do you do , all of you ?
I am here again .
I told you , you couldn ’ t tire me , you know .
I am fond of hard work , and am true to my word . ” “ There an ’ t , ” <unk> the man on the floor , whose head rested on his hand as he <unk> at us , “ any more on you to come in , is there ? ” “ No , my friend , ” said Mrs. Pardiggle , <unk> herself on one stool and knocking down another .
“ We are all here . ” “ Because I thought there warn ’ t enough of you , perhaps ? ” said the man , with his pipe between his lips as he looked round upon us .
The young man and the girl both laughed .
Two friends of the young man , whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with their hands in their pockets , echoed the laugh <unk> .
“ You can ’ t tire me , good people , ” said Mrs. Pardiggle to these latter .
“ I enjoy hard work , and the harder you make mine , the better I like it . ” “ Then make it easy for her ! ” <unk> the man upon the floor .
“ I wants it done , and over .
I wants a end of these <unk> took with my place .
I wants an end of being <unk> like a <unk> .
Now you ’ re a-going to <unk> and question according to custom — I know what you ’ re a-going to be up to .
Well !
You haven ’ t got no occasion to be up to it .
I ’ ll save you the trouble .
Is my daughter <unk> ?
Yes , she IS <unk> .
Look at the water .
<unk> it !
That ’ s wot we drinks .
How do you like it , and what do you think of <unk> instead !
An ’ t my place dirty ?
Yes , it is dirty — it ’ s nat ’ rally dirty , and it ’ s nat ’ rally <unk> ; and we ’ ve had five dirty and <unk> children , as is all dead <unk> , and so much the better for them , and for us besides .
Have I read the little book wot you left ?
No , I an ’ t read the little book wot you left .
There an ’ t nobody here as knows how to read it ; and if there wos , it wouldn ’ t be suitable to me .
It ’ s a book fit for a <unk> , and I ’ m not a <unk> .
If you was to leave me a doll , I shouldn ’ t <unk> it .
How have I been conducting of myself ?
Why , I ’ ve been drunk for three days ; and I ’ <unk> been drunk four if I ’ <unk> had the money .
Don ’ t I never mean for to go to church ?
No , I don ’ t never mean for to go to church .
I shouldn ’ t be expected there , if I did ; the beadle ’ s too <unk> for me .
And how did my wife get that black eye ?
Why , I give it her ; and if she says I didn ’ t , she ’ s a Lie ! ” He had pulled his pipe out of his mouth to say all this , and he now turned over on his other side and smoked again .
Mrs. Pardiggle , who had been regarding him through her spectacles with a <unk> composure , calculated , I could not help thinking , to <unk> his <unk> , pulled out a good book as if it were a constable ’ s staff and took the whole family into custody .
I mean into <unk> custody , of course ; but she really did it as if she were an <unk> moral policeman carrying them all off to a <unk> .
Ada and I were very uncomfortable .
We both felt <unk> and out of place , and we both thought that Mrs. Pardiggle would have got on infinitely better if she had not had such a <unk> way of taking possession of people .
The children <unk> and <unk> ; the family took no notice of us whatever , except when the young man made the dog bark , which he usually did when Mrs. Pardiggle was most emphatic .
We both felt <unk> sensible that between us and these people there was an iron <unk> which could not be removed by our new friend .
By whom or how it could be removed , we did not know , but we knew that .
Even what she read and said seemed to us to be <unk> for such <unk> , if it had been imparted ever so modestly and with ever so much tact .
As to the little book to which the man on the floor had referred , we acquired a knowledge of it afterwards , and Mr. Jarndyce said he doubted if <unk> <unk> could have read it , though he had had no other on his desolate <unk> .
We were much relieved , under these circumstances , when Mrs. Pardiggle left off .
The man on the floor , then turning his head round again , said <unk> , “ Well !
You ’ ve done , have you ? ” “ For to-day , I have , my friend .
But I am never fatigued .
I shall come to you again in your regular order , ” returned Mrs. Pardiggle with <unk> cheerfulness .
“ So long as you goes now , ” said he , folding his arms and shutting his eyes with an oath , “ you may do wot you like ! ” Mrs. Pardiggle accordingly rose and made a little <unk> in the confined room from which the pipe itself very <unk> <unk> .
<unk> one of her young family in each hand , and telling the others to follow closely , and expressing her hope that the brickmaker and all his house would be improved when she saw them next , she then proceeded to another cottage .
I hope it is not <unk> in me to say that she certainly did make , in this as in everything else , a show that was not <unk> of doing charity by <unk> and of dealing in it to a large extent .
She supposed that we were following her , but as soon as the space was left clear , we approached the woman sitting by the fire to ask if the baby were ill . She only looked at it as it lay on her lap .
We had observed before that when she looked at it she covered her discoloured eye with her hand , as though she wished to separate any association with noise and violence and ill treatment from the poor little child .
Ada , whose gentle heart was moved by its appearance , bent down to touch its little face .
As she did so , I saw what happened and drew her back .
The child died .
“ Oh , Esther ! ” cried Ada , sinking on her knees beside it .
“ Look here !
Oh , Esther , my love , the little thing !
The suffering , quiet , pretty little thing !
I am so sorry for it .
I am so sorry for the mother .
I never saw a sight so <unk> as this before !
Oh , baby , baby ! ” Such compassion , such gentleness , as that with which she bent down weeping and put her hand upon the mother ’ s might have softened any mother ’ s heart that ever beat .
The woman at first <unk> at her in astonishment and then burst into tears .
Presently I took the light burden from her lap , did what I could to make the baby ’ s rest the <unk> and <unk> , laid it on a shelf , and covered it with my own handkerchief .
We tried to comfort the mother , and we whispered to her what Our <unk> said of children .
She answered nothing , but sat weeping — weeping very much .
When I turned , I found that the young man had taken out the dog and was standing at the door looking in upon us with dry eyes , but quiet .
The girl was quiet too and sat in a corner looking on the ground .
The man had risen .
He still smoked his pipe with an air of <unk> , but he was silent .
An ugly woman , very poorly <unk> , hurried in while I was glancing at them , and coming straight up to the mother , said , “ Jenny !
Jenny ! ” The mother rose on being so addressed and fell upon the woman ’ s neck .
She also had upon her face and arms the marks of ill <unk> .
She had no kind of grace about her , but the grace of sympathy ; but when she <unk> with the woman , and her own tears fell , she wanted no beauty .
I say <unk> , but her only words were “ Jenny !
Jenny ! ” All the rest was in the tone in which she said them .
I thought it very touching to see these two women , coarse and shabby and beaten , so united ; to see what they could be to one another ; to see how they felt for one another , how the heart of each to each was softened by the hard <unk> of their lives .
I think the best side of such people is almost hidden from us .
What the poor are to the poor is little known , excepting to themselves and God .
We felt it better to withdraw and leave them <unk> .
We <unk> out quietly and without notice from any one except the man .
He was leaning against the wall near the door , and finding that there was scarcely room for us to pass , went out before us .
He seemed to want to hide that he did this on our account , but we perceived that he did , and thanked him .
He made no answer .
Ada was so full of grief all the way home , and Richard , whom we found at home , was so distressed to see her in tears ( though he said to me , when she was not present , how beautiful it was too !
) , that we arranged to return at night with some little comforts and repeat our visit at the <unk> ’ s house .
We said as little as we could to Mr. Jarndyce , but the wind changed directly .
Richard accompanied us at night to the scene of our morning expedition .
On our way there , we had to pass a <unk> <unk> , where a number of men were <unk> about the door .
Among them , and prominent in some dispute , was the father of the little child .
At a short distance , we passed the young man and the dog , in congenial company .
The sister was standing laughing and talking with some other young women at the corner of the row of <unk> , but she seemed ashamed and turned away as we went by .
We left our escort within sight of the brickmaker ’ s dwelling and proceeded by ourselves .
When we came to the door , we found the woman who had brought such consolation with her standing there looking anxiously out .
“ It ’ s you , young ladies , is it ? ” she said in a whisper .
“ I ’ m <unk> for my master .
My heart ’ s in my mouth .
If he was to catch me away from home , he ’ d pretty near murder me . ” “ Do you mean your husband ? ” said I.
“ Yes , miss , my master .
Jenny ’ s asleep , quite worn out .
She ’ s scarcely had the child off her lap , poor thing , these seven days and nights , except when I ’ ve been able to take it for a minute or two . ” As she gave way for us , she went softly in and put what we had brought near the miserable bed on which the mother slept .
No effort had been made to clean the room — it seemed in its nature almost hopeless of being clean ; but the small <unk> form from which so much <unk> <unk> itself had been composed afresh , and washed , and neatly dressed in some fragments of white linen ; and on my handkerchief , which still covered the poor baby , a little bunch of sweet <unk> had been laid by the same rough , <unk> hands , so lightly , so tenderly !
“ May heaven reward you ! ” we said to her .
“ You are a good woman . ” “ Me , young ladies ? ” she returned with surprise .
“ Hush !
Jenny , Jenny ! ” The mother had <unk> in her sleep and moved .
The sound of the familiar voice seemed to calm her again .
She was quiet once more .
How little I thought , when I raised my handkerchief to look upon the tiny <unk> underneath and seemed to see a <unk> shine around the child through Ada ’ s drooping hair as her pity bent her head — how little I thought in whose <unk> bosom that handkerchief would come to lie after <unk> the motionless and peaceful breast !
I only thought that perhaps the <unk> of the child might not be all unconscious of the woman who <unk> it with so compassionate a hand ; not all unconscious of her presently , when we had taken leave , and left her at the door , by turns looking , and listening in terror for herself , and saying in her old <unk> manner , “ Jenny , Jenny ! ” CHAPTER <unk> <unk> and <unk> I don ’ t know how it is I seem to be always writing about myself .
I mean all the time to write about other people , and I try to think about myself as little as possible , and I am sure , when I find myself coming into the story again , I am really <unk> and say , “ Dear , dear , you tiresome little creature , I wish you wouldn ’ t ! ” but it is all of no use .
I hope any one who may read what I write will understand that if these pages contain a great deal about me , I can only suppose it must be because I have really something to do with them and can ’ t be kept out .
My darling and I read together , and worked , and <unk> , and found so much employment for our time that the winter days <unk> by us like <unk> birds .
<unk> in the <unk> , and always in the evenings , Richard gave us his company .
Although he was one of the most restless creatures in the world , he certainly was very fond of our society .
He was very , very , very fond of Ada .
I mean it , and I had better say it at once .
I had never seen any young people falling in love before , but I found them out quite soon .
I could not say so , of course , or show that I knew anything about it .
On the contrary , I was so <unk> and used to seem so unconscious that sometimes I considered within myself while I was sitting at work whether I was not growing quite <unk> .
But there was no help for it .
All I had to do was to be quiet , and I was as quiet as a mouse .
They were as quiet as <unk> too , so far as any words were concerned , but the innocent manner in which they <unk> more and more upon me as they took more and more to one another was so charming that I had great difficulty in not showing how it interested me .
“ Our dear little old woman is such a capital old woman , ” Richard would say , coming up to meet me in the garden early , with his pleasant laugh and perhaps the least <unk> of a <unk> , “ that I can ’ t get on without her .
Before I begin my <unk> day — <unk> away at those books and <unk> and then <unk> up hill and down <unk> , all the country round , like a <unk> — it does me so much good to come and have a steady walk with our comfortable friend , that here I am again ! ” “ You know , Dame Durden , dear , ” Ada would say at night , with her head upon my shoulder and the <unk> shining in her thoughtful eyes , “ I don ’ t want to talk when we come upstairs here .
Only to sit a little while thinking , with your dear face for company , and to hear the wind and remember the poor <unk> at sea — ” Ah !
Perhaps Richard was going to be a sailor .
We had talked it over very often now , and there was some talk of gratifying the inclination of his childhood for the sea .
Mr. Jarndyce had written to a relation of the family , a great Sir Leicester Dedlock , for his interest in Richard ’ s favour , generally ; and Sir Leicester had replied in a gracious manner that he would be happy to advance the prospects of the young gentleman if it should ever prove to be within his power , which was not at all probable , and that my Lady sent her compliments to the young gentleman ( to whom she perfectly remembered that she was <unk> by remote <unk> ) and trusted that he would ever do his duty in any honourable profession to which he might devote himself .
“ So I <unk> it ’ s pretty clear , ” said Richard to me , “ that I shall have to work my own way .
Never mind !
<unk> of people have had to do that before now , and have done it .
I only wish I had the command of a <unk> <unk> to begin with and could carry off the Chancellor and keep him on short allowance until he gave judgment in our cause .
He ’ d find himself growing thin , if he didn ’ t look sharp ! ” With a <unk> and <unk> and a gaiety that hardly ever <unk> , Richard had a <unk> in his character that quite perplexed me , principally because he <unk> it , in such a very odd way , for <unk> .
It entered into all his <unk> about money in a singular manner which I don ’ t think I can better explain than by <unk> for a moment to our <unk> to Mr. Skimpole .
Mr. Jarndyce had <unk> the amount , either from Mr. Skimpole himself or from Coavinses , and had placed the money in my hands with instructions to me to retain my own part of it and hand the rest to Richard .
The number of little <unk> of <unk> <unk> which Richard <unk> by the recovery of his ten pounds , and the number of times he talked to me as if he had saved or <unk> that amount , would form a sum in simple addition .
“ My prudent Mother <unk> , why not ? ” he said to me when he wanted , without the least consideration , to bestow five pounds on the brickmaker .
“ I made ten pounds , clear , out of Coavinses ’ business . ” “ How was that ? ” said I.
“ Why , I got rid of ten pounds which I was quite content to get rid of and never expected to see any more .
You don ’ t deny that ? ” “ No , ” said I.
“ Very well !
Then I came into possession of ten pounds — ” “ The same ten pounds , ” I hinted .
“ That has nothing to do with it ! ” returned Richard .
“ I have got ten pounds more than I expected to have , and consequently I can afford to spend it without being particular . ” In exactly the same way , when he was persuaded out of the sacrifice of these five pounds by being convinced that it would do no good , he carried that sum to his credit and drew upon it .
“ Let me see ! ” he would say .
“ I saved five pounds out of the brickmaker ’ s affair , so if I have a good rattle to London and back in a <unk> and put that down at four pounds , I shall have saved one .
And it ’ s a very good thing to save one , let me tell you : a penny saved is a penny got ! ” I believe Richard ’ s was as frank and generous a nature as there possibly can be .
He was <unk> and brave , and in the midst of all his wild <unk> , was so gentle that I knew him like a brother in a few weeks .
His gentleness was natural to him and would have shown itself <unk> even without Ada ’ s influence ; but with it , he became one of the most <unk> of companions , always so ready to be interested and always so happy , sanguine , and light-hearted .
I am sure that I , sitting with them , and walking with them , and talking with them , and noticing from day to day how they went on , falling deeper and deeper in love , and saying nothing about it , and each <unk> thinking that this love was the greatest of secrets , perhaps not yet suspected even by the other — I am sure that I was scarcely less enchanted than they were and scarcely less pleased with the pretty dream .
We were going on in this way , when one morning at breakfast Mr. Jarndyce received a letter , and looking at the <unk> , said , “ From Boythorn ?
Aye , aye ! ” and opened and read it with evident pleasure , announcing to us in a <unk> when he was about <unk> through , that Boythorn was “ coming down ” on a visit .
Now who was Boythorn , we all thought .
And I dare say we all thought too — I am sure I did , for one — would Boythorn at all <unk> with what was going forward ?
“ I went to school with this fellow , Lawrence Boythorn , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , tapping the letter as he laid it on the table , “ more than five and forty years ago .
He was then the most <unk> boy in the world , and he is now the most <unk> man .
He was then the <unk> boy in the world , and he is now the <unk> man .
He was then the <unk> and <unk> boy in the world , and he is now the <unk> and <unk> man .
He is a tremendous fellow . ” “ In <unk> , sir ? ” asked Richard .
“ Pretty well , Rick , in that respect , ” said Mr. Jarndyce ; “ being some ten years older than I and a couple of <unk> <unk> , with his head thrown back like an old soldier , his stalwart chest squared , his hands like a clean <unk> ’ s , and his <unk> !
There ’ s no <unk> for his <unk> .
<unk> , laughing , or <unk> , they make the <unk> of the house shake . ” As Mr. Jarndyce sat enjoying the image of his friend Boythorn , we observed the favourable omen that there was not the least indication of any change in the wind .
“ But it ’ s the inside of the man , the warm heart of the man , the passion of the man , the fresh blood of the man , Rick — and Ada , and little <unk> too , for you are all interested in a visitor — that I speak of , ” he pursued .
“ His language is as sounding as his voice .
He is always in <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> degree .
In his <unk> he is all <unk> .
You might suppose him to be an <unk> from what he says , and I believe he has the reputation of one with some people .
There !
I tell you no more of him beforehand .
You must not be surprised to see him take me under his protection , for he has never forgotten that I was a low boy at school and that our friendship began in his knocking two of my head <unk> ’ s teeth out ( he says six ) before breakfast .
Boythorn and his man , ” to me , “ will be here this afternoon , my dear . ” I took care that the necessary preparations were made for Mr. Boythorn ’ s reception , and we looked forward to his arrival with some curiosity .
The afternoon wore away , however , and he did not appear .
The <unk> arrived , and still he did not appear .
The dinner was put back an hour , and we were sitting round the fire with no light but the blaze when the <unk> suddenly burst open and the hall <unk> with these words , uttered with the greatest vehemence and in a <unk> tone : “ We have been <unk> , Jarndyce , by a most abandoned <unk> , who told us to take the turning to the right instead of to the left .
He is the most intolerable <unk> on the face of the earth .
His father must have been a most <unk> <unk> , ever to have such a son .
I would have had that fellow shot without the least remorse ! ” “ Did he do it on purpose ? ” Mr. Jarndyce inquired .
“ I have not the <unk> doubt that the <unk> has passed his whole existence in <unk> <unk> ! ” returned the other .
“ By my soul , I thought him the <unk> dog I had ever beheld when he was telling me to take the turning to the right .
And yet I stood before that fellow face to face and didn ’ t knock his brains out ! ” “ <unk> , you mean ? ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ Ha , ha , ha ! ” laughed Mr. Lawrence Boythorn , really making the whole house <unk> .
“ What , you have not forgotten it yet !
Ha , ha , ha !
And that was another most <unk> vagabond !
By my soul , the countenance of that fellow when he was a boy was the <unk> image of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ever set up as a <unk> in a field of <unk> .
If I were to meet that most <unk> <unk> in the streets to-morrow , I would fell him like a <unk> tree ! ” “ I have no doubt of it , ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ Now , will you come upstairs ? ” “ By my soul , Jarndyce , ” returned his guest , who seemed to refer to his watch , “ if you had been married , I would have turned back at the <unk> and gone away to the remotest <unk> of the <unk> <unk> sooner than I would have presented myself at this <unk> hour . ” “ Not quite so far , I hope ? ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ By my life and honour , yes ! ” cried the visitor .
“ I wouldn ’ t be guilty of the <unk> <unk> of keeping a lady of the house waiting all this time for any earthly consideration .
I would infinitely rather <unk> myself — infinitely rather ! ” <unk> thus , they went upstairs , and presently we heard him in his bedroom thundering “ Ha , ha , ha ! ” and again “ Ha , ha , ha ! ” until the <unk> echo in the neighbourhood seemed to catch the <unk> and to laugh as <unk> as he did or as we did when we heard him laugh .
We all <unk> a <unk> in his favour , for there was a <unk> quality in this laugh , and in his <unk> , healthy voice , and in the <unk> and fullness with which he uttered every word he spoke , and in the very <unk> of his <unk> , which seemed to go off like blank <unk> and hurt nothing .
But we were hardly prepared to have it so confirmed by his appearance when Mr. Jarndyce presented him .
He was not only a very handsome old gentleman — upright and stalwart as he had been described to us — with a massive grey head , a fine composure of face when silent , a figure that might have become <unk> but for his being so continually in earnest that he gave it no rest , and a chin that might have <unk> into a double chin but for the vehement emphasis in which it was constantly required to assist ; but he was such a true gentleman in his manner , so <unk> polite , his face was lighted by a smile of so much <unk> and tenderness , and it seemed so plain that he had nothing to hide , but showed himself exactly as he was — incapable , as Richard said , of anything on a limited scale , and <unk> away with those blank great guns because he carried no small arms whatever — that really I could not help looking at him with equal pleasure as he sat at dinner , whether he <unk> <unk> with Ada and me , or was led by Mr. Jarndyce into some great <unk> of <unk> , or threw up his head like a <unk> and gave out that tremendous “ Ha , ha , ha ! ” “ You have brought your bird with you , I suppose ? ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ By heaven , he is the most astonishing bird in Europe ! ” replied the other .
“ He IS the most wonderful creature !
I wouldn ’ t take ten thousand guineas for that bird .
I have left an <unk> for his sole support in case he should <unk> me .
He is , in sense and attachment , a phenomenon .
And his father before him was one of the most astonishing birds that ever lived ! ” The subject of this <unk> was a very little <unk> , who was so <unk> that he was brought down by Mr. Boythorn ’ s man , on his forefinger , and after taking a gentle flight round the room , alighted on his master ’ s head .
To hear Mr. Boythorn presently expressing the most <unk> and passionate sentiments , with this <unk> mite of a creature quietly <unk> on his forehead , was to have a good <unk> of his character , I thought .
“ By my soul , Jarndyce , ” he said , very gently holding up a bit of bread to the <unk> to <unk> at , “ if I were in your place I would <unk> every master in Chancery by the throat to-morrow morning and shake him until his money rolled out of his pockets and his bones rattled in his <unk> .
I would have a settlement out of somebody , by fair means or by foul .
If you would <unk> me to do it , I would do it for you with the greatest satisfaction ! ” ( All this time the very small <unk> was eating out of his hand . )
“ I thank you , Lawrence , but the suit is hardly at such a point at present , ” returned Mr. Jarndyce , laughing , “ that it would be greatly advanced even by the legal process of shaking the bench and the whole bar . ” “ There never was such an infernal <unk> as that Chancery on the face of the earth ! ” said Mr. Boythorn .
“ Nothing but a mine below it on a busy day in term time , with all its <unk> , <unk> , and precedents collected in it and every <unk> belonging to it also , high and low , upward and downward , from its son the <unk> to its father the <unk> , and the whole blown to <unk> with ten thousand <unk> of gunpowder , would <unk> it in the least ! ” It was impossible not to laugh at the <unk> gravity with which he <unk> this strong measure of <unk> .
When we laughed , he threw up his head and shook his broad chest , and again the whole country seemed to echo to his “ Ha , ha , ha ! ” It had not the least effect in <unk> the bird , whose sense of security was complete and who <unk> about the table with its quick head now on this side and now on that , turning its bright sudden eye on its master as if he were no more than another bird .
“ But how do you and your <unk> get on about the disputed right of way ? ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ You are not free from the <unk> of the law yourself ! ” “ The fellow has brought actions against ME for trespass , and I have brought actions against HIM for trespass , ” returned Mr. Boythorn .
“ By heaven , he is the <unk> fellow breathing .
It is <unk> impossible that his name can be Sir Leicester .
It must be Sir <unk> . ” “ <unk> to our distant relation ! ” said my guardian laughingly to Ada and Richard .
“ I would beg Miss Clare ’ s pardon and Mr. Carstone ’ s pardon , ” resumed our visitor , “ if I were not reassured by seeing in the fair face of the lady and the smile of the gentleman that it is quite unnecessary and that they keep their distant relation at a comfortable distance . ” “ Or he keeps us , ” suggested Richard .
“ By my soul , ” exclaimed Mr. Boythorn , suddenly <unk> another <unk> , “ that fellow is , and his father was , and his grandfather was , the most <unk> , <unk> imbecile , <unk> <unk> , ever , by some <unk> mistake of Nature , born in any station of life but a <unk> ’ s !
The whole of that family are the most solemnly <unk> and <unk> <unk> !
But it ’ s no matter ; he should not shut up my path if he were fifty <unk> melted into one and living in a hundred Chesney <unk> , one within another , like the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
The fellow , by his agent , or <unk> , or somebody , writes to me ‘ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , presents his compliments to Mr. Lawrence Boythorn , and has to call his attention to the fact that the green <unk> by the old <unk> , now the property of Mr. Lawrence Boythorn , is Sir Leicester ’ s right of way , being in fact a portion of the park of Chesney Wold , and that Sir Leicester finds it convenient to close up the same . ’ I write to the fellow , ‘ Mr.
Lawrence Boythorn presents his compliments to Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and has to call HIS attention to the fact that he <unk> <unk> the whole of Sir Leicester Dedlock ’ s <unk> on every possible subject and has to add , in reference to closing up the <unk> , that he will be glad to see the man who may undertake to do it . ’ The fellow sends a most abandoned <unk> with one eye to <unk> a gateway .
I play upon that <unk> <unk> with a <unk> until the breath is nearly driven out of his body .
The fellow <unk> a gate in the night .
I <unk> it down and burn it in the morning .
He sends his <unk> to come over the <unk> and pass and <unk> .
I catch them in <unk> man <unk> , fire <unk> <unk> at their legs , play upon them with the <unk> — resolve to free mankind from the <unk> burden of the existence of those <unk> <unk> .
He brings actions for trespass ; I bring actions for trespass .
He brings actions for <unk> and <unk> ; I defend them and continue to <unk> and <unk> .
Ha , ha , ha ! ” To hear him say all this with <unk> energy , one might have thought him the <unk> of mankind .
To see him at the very same time , looking at the bird now <unk> upon his <unk> and softly smoothing its feathers with his forefinger , one might have thought him the <unk> .
To hear him laugh and see the broad good nature of his face then , one might have supposed that he had not a care in the world , or a dispute , or a <unk> , but that his whole existence was a summer joke .
“ No , no , ” he said , “ no closing up of my <unk> by any Dedlock !
Though I willingly confess , ” here he softened in a moment , “ that Lady Dedlock is the most accomplished lady in the world , to whom I would do any homage that a plain gentleman , and no baronet with a head seven hundred years thick , may .
A man who joined his <unk> at twenty and within a week <unk> the most <unk> and <unk> <unk> of a commanding officer that ever drew the breath of life through a tight waist — and got broke for it — is not the man to be walked over by all the Sir <unk> , dead or alive , locked or <unk> .
Ha , ha , ha ! ” “ Nor the man to allow his <unk> to be walked over either ? ” said my guardian .
“ Most assuredly not ! ” said Mr. Boythorn , clapping him on the shoulder with an air of protection that had something serious in it , though he laughed .
“ He will stand by the low boy , always .
Jarndyce , you may rely upon him !
But speaking of this trespass — with <unk> to Miss Clare and Miss Summerson for the length at which I have pursued so dry a subject — is there nothing for me from your men Kenge and Carboy ? ” “ I think not , Esther ? ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ Nothing , guardian . ” “ Much obliged ! ” said Mr. Boythorn .
“ <unk> no need to ask , after even my slight experience of Miss Summerson ’ s <unk> for every one about her . ” ( They all encouraged me ; they were determined to do it . )
“ I inquired because , coming from Lincolnshire , I of course have not yet been in town , and I thought some letters might have been sent down here .
I dare say they will report progress to-morrow morning . ” I saw him so often in the course of the evening , which passed very pleasantly , contemplate Richard and Ada with an interest and a satisfaction that made his fine face remarkably agreeable as he sat at a little distance from the piano listening to the music — and he had small occasion to tell us that he was <unk> fond of music , for his face showed it — that I asked my guardian as we sat at the <unk> board whether Mr. Boythorn had ever been married .
“ No , ” said he .
“ No . ” “ But he meant to be ! ” said I.
“ How did you find out that ? ” he returned with a smile .
“ Why , guardian , ” I explained , not without reddening a little at <unk> what was in my thoughts , “ there is something so tender in his manner , after all , and he is so very courtly and gentle to us , and — ” Mr. Jarndyce directed his eyes to where he was sitting as I have just described him .
I said no more .
“ You are right , little woman , ” he answered .
“ He was all but married once .
<unk> ago .
And once . ” “ Did the lady die ? ” “ No — but she died to him .
That time has had its influence on all his later life .
Would you suppose him to have a head and a heart full of <unk> yet ? ” “ I think , guardian , I might have supposed so .
But it is easy to say that when you have told me so . ” “ He has never since been what he might have been , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , “ and now you see him in his age with no one near him but his servant and his little yellow friend .
It ’ s your throw , my dear ! ” I felt , from my guardian ’ s manner , that beyond this point I could not pursue the subject without changing the wind .
I therefore <unk> to ask any further questions .
I was interested , but not curious .
I thought a little while about this old love story in the night , when I was awakened by Mr. Boythorn ’ s <unk> <unk> ; and I tried to do that very difficult thing , imagine old people young again and <unk> with the <unk> of youth .
But I fell asleep before I had succeeded , and dreamed of the days when I lived in my godmother ’ s house .
I am not sufficiently acquainted with such subjects to know whether it is at all remarkable that I almost always dreamed of that period of my life .
With the morning there came a letter from Messrs. Kenge and Carboy to Mr. Boythorn informing him that one of their clerks would wait upon him at noon .
As it was the day of the week on which I paid the bills , and added up my books , and made all the household affairs as <unk> as possible , I remained at home while Mr. Jarndyce , Ada , and Richard took advantage of a very fine day to make a little <unk> , Mr. Boythorn was to wait for Kenge and Carboy ’ s clerk and then was to go on foot to meet them on their return .
Well !
I was full of business , examining <unk> ’ s books , adding up <unk> , paying money , <unk> <unk> , and I dare say making a great bustle about it when Mr. Guppy was announced and shown in .
I had had some idea that the clerk who was to be sent down might be the young gentleman who had met me at the <unk> , and I was glad to see him , because he was associated with my present happiness .
I scarcely knew him again , he was so uncommonly <unk> .
He had an entirely new suit of <unk> clothes on , a shining hat , <unk> gloves , a <unk> of a variety of colours , a large <unk> flower in his <unk> , and a thick gold ring on his little finger .
Besides which , he quite <unk> the <unk> with bear ’ <unk> and other <unk> .
He looked at me with an attention that quite confused me when I begged him to take a seat until the servant should return ; and as he sat there crossing and <unk> his legs in a corner , and I asked him if he had had a pleasant ride , and hoped that Mr. Kenge was well , I never looked at him , but I found him looking at me in the same <unk> and curious way .
When the request was brought to him that he would go upstairs to Mr. Boythorn ’ s room , I mentioned that he would find <unk> prepared for him when he came down , of which Mr. Jarndyce hoped he would partake .
He said with some embarrassment , holding the handle of the door , “ Shall I have the honour of finding you here , miss ? ” I replied yes , I should be there ; and he went out with a bow and another look .
I thought him only awkward and shy , for he was evidently much embarrassed ; and I fancied that the best thing I could do would be to wait until I saw that he had everything he wanted and then to leave him to himself .
The <unk> was soon brought , but it remained for some time on the table .
The interview with Mr. Boythorn was a long one , and a <unk> one too , I should think , for although his room was at some distance I heard his loud voice rising every now and then like a high wind , and evidently blowing perfect <unk> of <unk> .
At last Mr. Guppy came back , looking something the worse for the conference .
“ My eye , miss , ” he said in a low voice , “ he ’ s a <unk> ! ” “ Pray take some refreshment , sir , ” said I. Mr. Guppy sat down at the table and began <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the <unk> , still looking at me ( as I felt quite sure without looking at him ) in the same unusual manner .
The <unk> lasted so long that at last I felt a kind of obligation on me to raise my eyes in order that I might break the <unk> under which he seemed to <unk> , of not being able to leave off .
He immediately looked at the dish and began to <unk> .
“ What will you take yourself , miss ?
You ’ ll take a morsel of something ? ” “ No , thank you , ” said I.
“ <unk> ’ t I give you a piece of anything at all , miss ? ” said Mr. Guppy , hurriedly drinking off a glass of wine .
“ Nothing , thank you , ” said I.
“ I have only waited to see that you have everything you want .
Is there anything I can order for you ? ” “ No , I am much obliged to you , miss , I ’ m sure .
I ’ ve everything that I can require to make me comfortable — at least I — not comfortable — I ’ m never that . ” He <unk> off two more glasses of wine , one after another .
I thought I had better go .
“ I beg your pardon , miss ! ” said Mr. Guppy , rising when he saw me rise .
“ But would you allow me the favour of a minute ’ s private conversation ? ” Not knowing what to say , I sat down again .
“ What follows is without prejudice , miss ? ” said Mr. Guppy , anxiously bringing a chair towards my table .
“ I don ’ t understand what you mean , ” said I , wondering .
“ It ’ s one of our law terms , miss .
You won ’ t make any use of it to my <unk> at Kenge and Carboy ’ s or elsewhere .
If our conversation shouldn ’ t lead to anything , I am to be as I was and am not to be <unk> in my situation or worldly prospects .
In short , it ’ s in total confidence . ” “ I am at a loss , sir , ” said I , “ to imagine what you can have to communicate in total confidence to me , whom you have never seen but once ; but I should be very sorry to do you any injury . ” “ Thank you , miss .
I ’ m sure of it — that ’ s quite sufficient . ” All this time Mr. Guppy was either <unk> his forehead with his handkerchief or tightly rubbing the palm of his left hand with the palm of his right .
“ If you would excuse my taking another glass of wine , miss , I think it might assist me in getting on without a <unk> <unk> that cannot fail to be <unk> unpleasant . ” He did so , and came back again .
I took the opportunity of moving well behind my table .
“ You wouldn ’ t allow me to offer you one , would you miss ? ” said Mr. Guppy , apparently refreshed .
“ Not any , ” said I.
“ Not half a glass ? ” said Mr. Guppy .
“ <unk> ?
No !
Then , to proceed .
My present <unk> , Miss Summerson , at Kenge and Carboy ’ s , is two pound a week .
When I first had the happiness of looking upon you , it was one fifteen , and had stood at that figure for a <unk> period .
A rise of five has since taken place , and a further rise of five is <unk> at the <unk> of a term not <unk> twelve months from the present date .
My mother has a little property , which takes the form of a small life <unk> , upon which she lives in an <unk> though <unk> manner in the Old Street Road .
She is eminently calculated for a <unk> .
She never <unk> , is all for peace , and her disposition easy .
She has her <unk> — as who has not ? — but I never knew her do it when company was present , at which time you may freely trust her with <unk> , spirits , or <unk> <unk> .
My own <unk> is lodgings at <unk> Place , <unk> .
It is <unk> , but airy , open at the back , and considered one of the ’ <unk> <unk> .
Miss Summerson !
In the <unk> language , I <unk> you .
Would you be so kind as to allow me ( as I may say ) to file a declaration — to make an offer ! ” Mr. Guppy went down on his knees .
I was well behind my table and not much frightened .
I said , “ Get up from that ridiculous position immediately , sir , or you will oblige me to break my <unk> promise and ring the bell ! ” “ <unk> me out , miss ! ” said Mr. Guppy , folding his hands .
“ I cannot consent to hear another word , sir , ” I returned , “ Unless you get up from the carpet directly and go and sit down at the table as you ought to do if you have any sense at all . ” He looked <unk> , but slowly rose and did so .
“ Yet what a <unk> it is , miss , ” he said with his hand upon his heart and shaking his head at me in a melancholy manner over the tray , “ to be <unk> behind food at such a moment .
The soul <unk> from food at such a moment , miss . ” “ I beg you to conclude , ” said I ; “ you have asked me to hear you out , and I beg you to conclude . ” “ I will , miss , ” said Mr. Guppy .
“ As I love and honour , so likewise I <unk> .
Would that I could make thee the subject of that <unk> before the <unk> ! ” “ That is quite impossible , ” said I , “ and entirely out of the question . ” “ I am aware , ” said Mr. Guppy , leaning forward over the tray and regarding me , as I again strangely felt , though my eyes were not directed to him , with his late intent look , “ I am aware that in a worldly point of view , according to all appearances , my offer is a poor one .
But , Miss Summerson !
<unk> !
No , don ’ t ring — I have been brought up in a sharp school and am accustomed to a variety of general practice .
Though a young man , I have <unk> out evidence , got up cases , and seen <unk> of life .
<unk> with your hand , what means might I not find of advancing your interests and pushing your fortunes !
What might I not get to know , nearly concerning you ?
I know nothing now , certainly ; but what <unk> I not if I had your confidence , and you set me on ? ” I told him that he addressed my interest or what he supposed to be my interest quite as <unk> as he addressed my inclination , and he would now understand that I requested him , if he pleased , to go away immediately .
“ <unk> miss , ” said Mr. Guppy , “ hear but another word !
I think you must have seen that I was struck with those charms on the day when I waited at the <unk> .
I think you must have remarked that I could not <unk> a tribute to those charms when I put up the steps of the ’ <unk> .
It was a feeble tribute to thee , but it was well meant .
<unk> image has ever since been fixed in my breast .
I have walked up and down of an evening opposite Jellyby ’ s house only to look upon the bricks that once contained thee .
This out of to-day , quite an unnecessary out so far as the attendance , which was its pretended object , went , was <unk> by me alone for thee alone .
If I speak of interest , it is only to recommend myself and my <unk> <unk> .
<unk> was before it , and is before it . ” “ I should be <unk> , Mr. Guppy , ” said I , rising and putting my hand upon the <unk> , “ to do you or any one who was <unk> the injustice of <unk> any honest feeling , however <unk> expressed .
If you have really meant to give me a proof of your good opinion , though <unk> and <unk> , I feel that I ought to thank you .
I have very little reason to be proud , and I am not proud .
I hope , ” I think I added , without very well knowing what I said , “ that you will now go away as if you had never been so exceedingly foolish and attend to Messrs. Kenge and Carboy ’ s business . ” “ <unk> a minute , miss ! ” cried Mr. Guppy , <unk> me as I was about to ring .
“ This has been without prejudice ? ” “ I will never mention it , ” said I , “ unless you should give me future occasion to do so . ” “ A quarter of a minute , miss !
In case you should think better at any time , however distant — THAT ’ S no consequence , for my feelings can never <unk> — of anything I have said , particularly what might I not do , Mr. William Guppy , <unk> , <unk> Place , or if removed , or dead ( of blighted hopes or anything of that sort ) , care of Mrs. Guppy , three hundred and two , Old Street Road , will be sufficient . ” I rang the bell , the servant came , and Mr. Guppy , laying his written card upon the table and making a dejected bow , departed .
<unk> my eyes as he went out , I once more saw him looking at me after he had passed the door .
I sat there for another hour or more , finishing my books and <unk> and getting through plenty of business .
Then I arranged my desk , and put everything away , and was so composed and cheerful that I thought I had quite dismissed this unexpected <unk> .
But , when I went upstairs to my own room , I surprised myself by beginning to laugh about it and then surprised myself still more by beginning to cry about it .
In short , I was in a <unk> for a little while and felt as if an old <unk> had been more <unk> touched than it ever had been since the days of the dear old doll , long buried in the garden .
CHAPTER <unk> The <unk> On the <unk> <unk> of Chancery Lane , that is to say , more particularly in Cook ’ s Court , Cursitor Street , Mr. Snagsby , law-stationer , pursues his <unk> calling .
In the shade of Cook ’ s Court , at most times a shady place , Mr. Snagsby has <unk> in all sorts of blank forms of legal process ; in <unk> and rolls of parchment ; in paper — <unk> , brief , <unk> , brown , white , <unk> , and <unk> ; in <unk> ; in <unk> , pens , ink , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ; in red <unk> and green <unk> ; in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and law <unk> ; in <unk> boxes , <unk> , <unk> — glass and leaden — <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and other small <unk> ; in short , in articles too numerous to mention , ever since he was out of his time and went into <unk> with Peffer .
On that occasion , Cook ’ s Court was in a manner <unk> by the new inscription in fresh <unk> , <unk> AND <unk> , <unk> the <unk> and not easily to be <unk> <unk> <unk> only .
For smoke , which is the London ivy , had so <unk> itself round Peffer ’ s name and clung to his <unk> that the affectionate <unk> quite overpowered the parent tree .
Peffer is never seen in Cook ’ s Court now .
He is not expected there , for he has been <unk> this quarter of a century in the churchyard of St. <unk> , Holborn , with the <unk> and <unk> <unk> past him all the day and half the night like one great dragon .
If he ever steal forth when the dragon is at rest to air himself again in Cook ’ s Court until <unk> to return by the <unk> of the sanguine cock in the cellar at the little <unk> in Cursitor Street , whose ideas of daylight it would be curious to <unk> , since he knows from his personal observation next to nothing about it — if Peffer ever do <unk> the pale <unk> of Cook ’ s Court , which no law-stationer in the trade can positively deny , he comes <unk> , and no one is the worse or wiser .
In his lifetime , and likewise in the period of Snagsby ’ s “ time ” of seven long years , there dwelt with Peffer in the same <unk> premises a niece — a short , shrewd niece , something too violently <unk> about the waist , and with a sharp nose like a sharp autumn evening , <unk> to be frosty towards the end .
The Cook ’ s <unk> had a <unk> flying among them that the mother of this niece did , in her daughter ’ s childhood , moved by too jealous a <unk> that her figure should approach perfection , <unk> her up every morning with her <unk> foot against the <unk> for a stronger hold and <unk> ; and further , that she <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which <unk> , they held , had <unk> to the nose and temper of the patient .
With <unk> of the many <unk> of <unk> this <unk> report originated , it either never reached or never <unk> the ears of young Snagsby , who , having <unk> and won its fair subject on his arrival at man ’ s estate , entered into two <unk> at once .
So now , in Cook ’ s Court , Cursitor Street , Mr. Snagsby and the niece are one ; and the niece still <unk> her figure , which , however tastes may <unk> , is unquestionably so far precious that there is mighty little of it .
Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are not only one bone and one flesh , but , to the neighbours ’ thinking , one voice too .
That voice , appearing to proceed from Mrs. Snagsby alone , is heard in Cook ’ s Court very often .
Mr. Snagsby , otherwise than as he finds expression through these <unk> tones , is rarely heard .
He is a mild , bald , timid man with a shining head and a <unk> <unk> of black hair sticking out at the back .
He <unk> to <unk> and <unk> .
As he stands at his door in Cook ’ s Court in his grey <unk> and black <unk> sleeves , looking up at the clouds , or stands behind a desk in his dark shop with a heavy flat <unk> , <unk> and <unk> at <unk> in company with his two ’ prentices , he is <unk> a retiring and <unk> man .
From beneath his feet , at such times , as from a shrill ghost <unk> in its grave , there frequently arise <unk> and <unk> in the voice already mentioned ; and <unk> , on some occasions when these reach a <unk> pitch than usual , Mr. Snagsby <unk> to the ’ prentices , “ I think my little woman is <unk> it to Guster ! ” This proper name , so used by Mr. Snagsby , has before now <unk> the wit of the Cook ’ s <unk> to remark that it ought to be the name of Mrs. Snagsby , seeing that she might with great force and expression be <unk> a Guster , in compliment to her <unk> character .
It is , however , the possession , and the only possession except fifty shillings <unk> <unk> and a very small box <unk> filled with <unk> , of a lean young woman from a <unk> ( by some supposed to have been christened <unk> ) who , although she was <unk> or contracted for during her growing time by an amiable benefactor of his species <unk> at <unk> , and cannot fail to have been developed under the most favourable circumstances , “ has fits , ” which the <unk> can ’ t account for .
Guster , really aged three or four and twenty , but looking a round ten years older , goes cheap with this unaccountable <unk> of fits , and is so apprehensive of being returned on the hands of her patron saint that except when she is found with her head in the <unk> , or the <unk> , or the <unk> , or the dinner , or anything else that happens to be near her at the time of her <unk> , she is always at work .
She is a satisfaction to the parents and <unk> of the ’ prentices , who feel that there is little danger of her <unk> tender emotions in the breast of youth ; she is a satisfaction to Mrs. Snagsby , who can always find fault with her ; she is a satisfaction to Mr. Snagsby , who thinks it a charity to keep her .
The law-stationer ’ s establishment is , in Guster ’ s eyes , a <unk> of plenty and splendour .
She believes the little drawing-room upstairs , always kept , as one may say , with its hair in papers and its <unk> on , to be the most elegant apartment in <unk> .
The view it <unk> of Cook ’ s Court at one end ( not to mention a <unk> into Cursitor Street ) and of Coavinses ’ the <unk> ’ s officer ’ s backyard at the other she regards as a prospect of <unk> beauty .
The portraits it <unk> in oil — and plenty of it too — of Mr. Snagsby looking at Mrs. Snagsby and of Mrs. Snagsby looking at Mr. Snagsby are in her eyes as <unk> of <unk> or <unk> .
Guster has some <unk> for her many <unk> .
Mr. Snagsby refers everything not in the practical mysteries of the business to Mrs. Snagsby .
She <unk> the money , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> the times and places of devotion on Sundays , <unk> Mr. Snagsby ’ s <unk> , and <unk> no responsibility as to what she thinks fit to provide for dinner , <unk> that she is the high <unk> of comparison among the neighbouring wives a long way down Chancery Lane on both sides , and even out in Holborn , who in any domestic passages of arms habitually call upon their husbands to look at the difference between their ( the wives ’ ) position and Mrs. Snagsby ’ s , and their ( the husbands ’ ) behaviour and Mr. Snagsby ’ s .
<unk> , always flying <unk> about Cook ’ s Court and <unk> in and out at everybody ’ s windows , does say that Mrs. Snagsby is jealous and inquisitive and that Mr. Snagsby is sometimes <unk> out of house and home , and that if he had the spirit of a mouse he wouldn ’ t stand it .
It is even observed that the wives who <unk> him to their <unk> husbands as a shining example in reality look down upon him and that nobody does so with greater <unk> than one particular lady whose lord is more than suspected of laying his umbrella on her as an instrument of <unk> .
But these vague <unk> may arise from Mr. Snagsby ’ s being in his way rather a <unk> and <unk> man , loving to walk in <unk> Inn in the <unk> and to observe how <unk> the <unk> and the leaves are , also to <unk> about the <unk> Yard of a Sunday afternoon and to remark ( if in good spirits ) that there were old times once and that you ’ d find a stone <unk> or two now under that <unk> , he ’ ll be bound , if you was to <unk> for it .
He <unk> his imagination , too , by thinking of the many Chancellors and <unk> , and <unk> of the <unk> who are deceased ; and he gets such a flavour of the country out of telling the two ’ prentices how he <unk> heard say that a <unk> “ as clear as <unk> ” once ran right down the middle of Holborn , when <unk> really was a <unk> , leading <unk> away into the <unk> — gets such a flavour of the country out of this that he never wants to go there .
The day is closing in and the gas is lighted , but is not yet fully <unk> , for it is not quite dark .
Mr. Snagsby standing at his shop-door looking up at the clouds sees a crow who is out late <unk> <unk> over the <unk> of sky belonging to Cook ’ s Court .
The crow flies straight across Chancery Lane and Lincoln ’ s Inn Garden into Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields .
Here , in a large house , formerly a house of state , lives Mr. Tulkinghorn .
It is let off in sets of chambers now , and in those <unk> fragments of its greatness , lawyers lie like <unk> in <unk> .
But its <unk> staircases , passages , and <unk> still remain ; and even its painted <unk> , where Allegory , in Roman <unk> and <unk> linen , <unk> among <unk> and <unk> , flowers , clouds , and <unk> boys , and makes the head ache — as would seem to be Allegory ’ s object always , more or less .
Here , among his many boxes <unk> with <unk> names , lives Mr. Tulkinghorn , when not <unk> at home in <unk> where the great ones of the earth are bored to death .
Here he is to-day , quiet at his table .
An oyster of the old school whom nobody can open .
Like as he is to look at , so is his apartment in the dusk of the present afternoon .
<unk> , out of date , withdrawing from attention , able to afford it .
<unk> , <unk> , old-fashioned , <unk> chairs , not easily lifted ; <unk> tables with <unk> and dusty <unk> <unk> ; <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of great titles in the last <unk> or the last but one , <unk> him .
A thick and dingy <unk> <unk> the floor where he sits , attended by two candles in old-fashioned silver candlesticks that give a very <unk> light to his large room .
The titles on the backs of his books have retired into the <unk> ; everything that can have a lock has got one ; no key is visible .
Very few loose papers are about .
He has some manuscript near him , but is not referring to it .
With the round top of an inkstand and two broken bits of <unk> he is silently and slowly working out whatever train of indecision is in his mind .
Now the inkstand top is in the middle , now the red bit of <unk> , now the black bit .
That ’ s not it .
Mr. Tulkinghorn must <unk> them all up and begin again .
Here , beneath the painted ceiling , with <unk> Allegory staring down at his <unk> as if it meant to <unk> upon him , and he cutting it dead , Mr. Tulkinghorn has at once his house and office .
He keeps no staff , only one middle-aged man , usually a little out at elbows , who sits in a high pew in the hall and is rarely <unk> with business .
Mr. Tulkinghorn is not in a common way .
He wants no clerks .
He is a great <unk> of <unk> , not to be so tapped .
His clients want HIM ; he is all in all .
<unk> that he requires to be drawn are drawn by <unk> in the <unk> on mysterious instructions ; fair copies that he requires to be made are made at the <unk> ’ , expense being no consideration .
The middle-aged man in the pew knows scarcely more of the affairs of the peerage than any <unk> in Holborn .
The red bit , the black bit , the inkstand top , the other inkstand top , the little <unk> .
So !
You to the middle , you to the right , you to the left .
This train of indecision must surely be worked out now or never .
Now !
Mr. Tulkinghorn gets up , adjusts his spectacles , puts on his hat , puts the manuscript in his pocket , goes out , tells the middle-aged man out at elbows , “ I shall be back presently . ” Very rarely tells him anything more <unk> .
Mr. Tulkinghorn goes , as the crow came — not quite so straight , but nearly — to Cook ’ s Court , Cursitor Street .
To Snagsby ’ s , <unk> ’ s , <unk> <unk> and copied , <unk> executed in all its branches , &amp; c . , &amp; c . , &amp; c . It is somewhere about five or six o ’ clock in the afternoon , and a <unk> <unk> of warm tea <unk> in Cook ’ s Court .
It <unk> about Snagsby ’ s door .
The hours are early there : dinner at half-past one and supper at half-past nine .
Mr. Snagsby was about to <unk> into the <unk> regions to take tea when he looked out of his door just now and saw the crow who was out late .
“ Master at home ? ” Guster is minding the shop , for the ’ prentices take tea in the kitchen with Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby ; consequently , the <unk> ’ s two daughters , <unk> their <unk> at the two glasses in the two <unk> windows of the opposite house , are not <unk> the two ’ prentices to <unk> as they <unk> suppose , but are merely <unk> the <unk> admiration of Guster , whose hair won ’ t grow , and never would , and it is confidently thought , never will .
“ Master at home ? ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Master is at home , and Guster will fetch him .
Guster <unk> , glad to get out of the shop , which she regards with mingled dread and <unk> as a <unk> of awful <unk> of the great <unk> of the law — a place not to be entered after the gas is turned off .
Mr. Snagsby appears , <unk> , warm , <unk> , and <unk> .
<unk> a bit of bread and butter .
Says , “ Bless my soul , sir !
Mr. Tulkinghorn ! ” “ I want half a word with you , Snagsby . ” “ Certainly , sir !
Dear me , sir , why didn ’ t you send your young man round for me ?
Pray walk into the back shop , sir . ” Snagsby has brightened in a moment .
The confined room , strong of <unk> , is <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
Mr. Tulkinghorn sits , <unk> round , on a stool at the desk .
“ Jarndyce and Jarndyce , Snagsby . ” “ Yes , sir . ” Mr. Snagsby turns up the gas and coughs behind his hand , modestly anticipating profit .
Mr. Snagsby , as a timid man , is accustomed to cough with a variety of expressions , and so to save words .
“ You copied some affidavits in that cause for me lately . ” “ Yes , sir , we did . ” “ There was one of them , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , carelessly feeling — tight , <unk> oyster of the old school ! — in the wrong <unk> , “ the handwriting of which is peculiar , and I rather like .
As I happened to be passing , and thought I had it about me , I looked in to ask you — but I haven ’ t got it .
No matter , any other time will do .
Ah !
here it is !
I looked in to ask you who copied this . ” “ Who copied this , sir ? ” says Mr. Snagsby , taking it , laying it flat on the desk , and <unk> all the sheets at once with a <unk> and a twist of the left hand peculiar to <unk> .
“ We gave this out , sir .
We were giving out rather a large quantity of work just at that time .
I can tell you in a moment who copied it , sir , by referring to my book . ” Mr. Snagsby takes his book down from the safe , makes another <unk> of the bit of bread and butter which seemed to have stopped short , eyes the affidavit aside , and brings his right forefinger travelling down a page of the book , “ <unk> — <unk> — Jarndyce . ” “ Jarndyce !
Here we are , sir , ” says Mr. Snagsby .
“ To be sure !
I might have remembered it .
This was given out , sir , to a writer who lodges just over on the opposite side of the lane . ” Mr. Tulkinghorn has seen the entry , found it before the law-stationer , read it while the forefinger was coming down the hill .
“ <unk> do you call him ?
Nemo ? ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ Nemo , sir .
Here it is .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> out on the Wednesday night at eight o ’ clock , brought in on the <unk> morning at half after nine . ” “ Nemo ! ” repeats Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ Nemo is <unk> for no one . ” “ It must be English for some one , sir , I think , ” Mr. Snagsby <unk> with his deferential cough .
“ It is a person ’ s name .
Here it is , you see , sir !
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> out Wednesday night , eight o ’ clock ; brought in <unk> morning , half after nine . ” The <unk> of Mr. Snagsby ’ s eye becomes conscious of the head of Mrs. Snagsby looking in at the shop-door to know what he means by <unk> his tea .
Mr. Snagsby addresses an <unk> cough to Mrs. Snagsby , as who should say , “ My dear , a customer ! ” “ <unk> after nine , sir , ” repeats Mr. Snagsby .
“ Our <unk> , who live by <unk> , are a queer lot ; and this may not be his name , but it ’ s the name he goes by .
I remember now , sir , that he gives it in a written <unk> he sticks up down at the <unk> Office , and the King ’ s <unk> Office , and the <unk> ’ <unk> , and so forth .
You know the kind of document , sir — wanting employ ? ” Mr. Tulkinghorn glances through the little window at the back of Coavinses ’ , the <unk> ’ s officer ’ s , where lights shine in Coavinses ’ windows .
Coavinses ’ <unk> is at the back , and the shadows of several gentlemen under a cloud <unk> <unk> upon the <unk> .
Mr. Snagsby takes the opportunity of slightly turning his head to glance over his shoulder at his little woman and to make apologetic motions with his mouth to this effect : “ <unk> — rich — <unk> ! ” “ Have you given this man work before ? ” asks Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ Oh , dear , yes , sir !
<unk> of yours . ” “ <unk> of more important matters , I forget where you said he lived ? ” “ <unk> the lane , sir .
In fact , he lodges at a — ” Mr. Snagsby makes another <unk> , as if the bit of bread and butter were <unk> “ — at a rag and bottle shop . ” “ Can you show me the place as I go back ? ” “ With the greatest pleasure , sir ! ” Mr. Snagsby <unk> off his sleeves and his grey coat , <unk> on his black coat , takes his hat from its <unk> .
“ Oh !
Here is my little woman ! ” he says aloud .
“ My dear , will you be so kind as to tell one of the <unk> to look after the shop while I step across the lane with Mr. Tulkinghorn ?
Mrs. Snagsby , sir — I <unk> ’ t be two minutes , my love ! ” Mrs. Snagsby bends to the lawyer , retires behind the counter , peeps at them through the <unk> , goes softly into the back office , refers to the <unk> in the book still lying open .
Is evidently curious .
“ You will find that the place is rough , sir , ” says Mr. Snagsby , walking <unk> in the road and leaving the narrow pavement to the lawyer ; “ and the party is very rough .
But they ’ re a wild lot in general , sir .
The advantage of this particular man is that he never wants sleep .
He ’ ll go at it right on end if you want him to , as long as ever you like . ” It is quite dark now , and the <unk> have acquired their full effect .
<unk> against clerks going to post the day ’ s letters , and against counsel and <unk> going home to dinner , and against <unk> and <unk> and suitors of all sorts , and against the general crowd , in whose way the forensic wisdom of ages has interposed a million of <unk> to the transaction of the <unk> business of life ; <unk> through law and equity , and through that <unk> mystery , the street mud , which is made of nobody knows what and <unk> about us nobody knows whence or how — we only knowing in general that when there is too much of it we find it necessary to <unk> it away — the lawyer and the law-stationer come to a rag and bottle shop and general <unk> of much <unk> <unk> , lying and being in the shadow of the wall of Lincoln ’ s Inn , and kept , as is announced in <unk> , to all whom it may concern , by one Krook .
“ This is where he lives , sir , ” says the law-stationer .
“ This is where he lives , is it ? ” says the lawyer <unk> .
“ Thank you . ” “ Are you not going in , sir ? ” “ No , thank you , no ; I am going on to the Fields at present .
Good evening .
Thank you ! ” Mr. Snagsby lifts his hat and returns to his little woman and his tea .
But Mr. Tulkinghorn does not go on to the Fields at present .
He goes a short way , turns back , comes again to the shop of Mr. Krook , and enters it straight .
It is dim enough , with a <unk> candle or so in the windows , and an old man and a cat sitting in the back part by a fire .
The old man rises and comes forward , with another <unk> candle in his hand .
“ Pray is your lodger within ? ” “ <unk> or female , sir ? ” says Mr. Krook .
“ <unk> .
The person who does copying . ” Mr. Krook has eyed his man <unk> .
<unk> him by sight .
Has an indistinct impression of his aristocratic <unk> .
“ Did you wish to see him , sir ? ” “ Yes . ” “ It ’ s what I seldom do myself , ” says Mr. Krook with a <unk> .
“ Shall I call him down ?
But it ’ s a weak chance if he ’ d come , sir ! ” “ I ’ ll go up to him , then , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ Second floor , sir .
Take the candle .
Up there ! ” Mr. Krook , with his cat beside him , stands at the bottom of the staircase , looking after Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ <unk> ! ” he says when Mr. Tulkinghorn has nearly disappeared .
The lawyer looks down over the <unk> .
The cat <unk> her wicked mouth and <unk> at him .
“ <unk> , Lady Jane !
<unk> yourself to visitors , my lady !
You know what they say of my lodger ? ” whispers Krook , going up a step or two .
“ What do they say of him ? ” “ They say he has sold himself to the enemy , but you and I know better — he don ’ t buy .
I ’ ll tell you what , though ; my lodger is so <unk> and gloomy that I believe he ’ d as soon make that bargain as any other .
Don ’ t put him out , sir .
That ’ s my advice ! ” Mr. Tulkinghorn with a nod goes on his way .
He comes to the dark door on the second floor .
He knocks , receives no answer , opens it , and accidentally <unk> his candle in doing so .
The air of the room is almost bad enough to have <unk> it if he had not .
It is a small room , nearly black with soot , and <unk> , and dirt .
In the rusty skeleton of a grate , pinched at the middle as if <unk> had <unk> it , a red <unk> fire <unk> low .
In the corner by the chimney stand a deal table and a broken desk , a wilderness marked with a rain of ink .
In another corner a ragged old portmanteau on one of the two chairs <unk> for <unk> or <unk> ; no larger one is needed , for it <unk> like the cheeks of a <unk> man .
The floor is bare , except that one old <unk> , trodden to <unk> of <unk> , lies <unk> upon the hearth .
No curtain <unk> the darkness of the night , but the discoloured shutters are drawn together , and through the two gaunt <unk> <unk> in them , <unk> might be staring in — the <unk> of the man upon the bed .
For , on a low bed opposite the fire , a confusion of dirty <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and coarse <unk> , the lawyer , hesitating just within the doorway , sees a man .
He lies there , dressed in <unk> and <unk> , with bare feet .
He has a yellow look in the <unk> darkness of a candle that has <unk> down until the whole length of its <unk> ( still burning ) has <unk> over and left a tower of <unk> above it .
His hair is ragged , <unk> with his whiskers and his <unk> — the latter , ragged too , and grown , like the <unk> and mist around him , in <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> as the room is , foul and <unk> as the air is , it is not easy to perceive what <unk> those are which most <unk> the senses in it ; but through the general <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> tobacco , there comes into the lawyer ’ s mouth the bitter , <unk> taste of opium .
“ <unk> , my friend ! ” he cries , and strikes his iron <unk> against the door .
He thinks he has awakened his friend .
He lies a little turned away , but his eyes are surely open .
“ <unk> , my friend ! ” he cries again .
“ <unk> !
<unk> ! ” As he rattles on the door , the candle which has <unk> so long goes out and leaves him in the dark , with the gaunt eyes in the shutters staring down upon the bed .
CHAPTER <unk> Our Dear <unk> A touch on the lawyer ’ s <unk> hand as he stands in the dark room , <unk> , makes him start and say , “ What ’ s that ? ” “ It ’ s me , ” returns the old man of the house , whose breath is in his ear .
“ Can ’ t you wake him ? ” “ No . ” “ What have you done with your candle ? ” “ It ’ s gone out .
Here it is . ” Krook takes it , goes to the fire , <unk> over the red <unk> , and tries to get a light .
The dying ashes have no light to spare , and his endeavours are vain .
<unk> , after an <unk> call to his lodger , that he will go downstairs and bring a lighted candle from the shop , the old man departs .
Mr. Tulkinghorn , for some new reason that he has , does not <unk> his return in the room , but on the stairs outside .
The welcome light soon shines upon the wall , as Krook comes slowly up with his <unk> cat following at his heels .
“ Does the man generally sleep like this ? ” inquired the lawyer in a low voice .
“ Hi !
I don ’ t know , ” says Krook , shaking his head and lifting his eyebrows .
“ I know next to nothing of his habits except that he keeps himself very close . ” Thus whispering , they both go in together .
As the light goes in , the great eyes in the shutters , darkening , seem to close .
Not so the eyes upon the bed .
“ God save us ! ” exclaims Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ He is dead ! ” Krook drops the heavy hand he has taken up so suddenly that the arm <unk> over the bedside .
They look at one another for a moment .
“ <unk> for some doctor !
Call for Miss Flite up the stairs , sir .
Here ’ s <unk> by the bed !
Call out for Flite , will you ? ” says Krook , with his lean hands spread out above the body like a <unk> ’ s wings .
Mr. Tulkinghorn hurries to the landing and calls , “ Miss Flite !
Flite !
Make haste , here , <unk> you are !
Flite ! ” Krook follows him with his eyes , and while he is calling , finds opportunity to steal to the old portmanteau and steal back again .
“ <unk> , Flite , run !
The nearest doctor !
<unk> ! ” So Mr. Krook addresses a crazy little woman who is his female lodger , who appears and <unk> in a breath , who soon returns accompanied by a <unk> medical man brought from his dinner , with a broad , <unk> upper lip and a broad <unk> tongue .
“ <unk> !
Bless the hearts o ’ ye , ” says the medical man , looking up at them after a moment ’ s examination .
“ He ’ s just as dead as <unk> ! ” Mr. Tulkinghorn ( standing by the old portmanteau ) inquires if he has been dead any time .
“ Any time , sir ? ” says the medical gentleman .
“ It ’ s probable he <unk> have been dead <unk> three hours . ” “ About that time , I should say , ” observes a dark young man on the other side of the bed .
“ <unk> you in the <unk> <unk> yourself , sir ? ” inquires the first .
The dark young man says yes .
“ Then I ’ ll just <unk> ’ my <unk> , ” replies the other , “ for I ’ m <unk> <unk> here ! ” With which remark he <unk> his brief attendance and returns to finish his dinner .
The dark young surgeon passes the candle across and across the face and carefully examines the law-writer , who has established his pretensions to his name by becoming indeed No one .
“ I knew this person by sight very well , ” says he .
“ He has <unk> opium of me for the last year and a half .
Was anybody present related to him ? ” glancing round upon the three <unk> .
“ I was his landlord , ” grimly answers Krook , taking the candle from the surgeon ’ s <unk> hand .
“ He told me once I was the nearest relation he had . ” “ He has died , ” says the surgeon , “ of an <unk> of opium , there is no doubt .
The room is strongly <unk> with it .
There is enough here now , ” taking an old <unk> from Mr. Krook , “ to <unk> a dozen people . ” “ Do you think he did it on purpose ? ” asks Krook .
“ Took the <unk> ? ” “ Yes ! ” Krook almost <unk> his lips with the <unk> of a horrible interest .
“ I can ’ t say .
I should think it unlikely , as he has been in the habit of taking so much .
But nobody can tell .
He was very poor , I suppose ? ” “ I suppose he was .
His room — don ’ t look rich , ” says Krook , who might have changed eyes with his cat , as he casts his sharp glance around .
“ But I have never been in it since he had it , and he was too close to name his circumstances to me . ” “ Did he owe you any rent ? ” “ Six weeks . ” “ He will never pay it ! ” says the young man , resuming his examination .
“ It is beyond a doubt that he is indeed as dead as <unk> ; and to judge from his appearance and condition , I should think it a happy release .
Yet he must have been a good figure when a youth , and I dare say , <unk> . ” He says this , not <unk> , while sitting on the bedstead ’ s <unk> with his face towards that other face and his hand upon the region of the heart .
“ I recollect once thinking there was something in his manner , <unk> as it was , that <unk> a fall in life .
Was that so ? ” he continues , looking round .
Krook replies , “ You might as well ask me to describe the ladies whose heads of hair I have got in <unk> downstairs .
<unk> that he was my lodger for a year and a half and lived — or didn ’ t live — by <unk> , I know no more of him . ” During this <unk> Mr. Tulkinghorn has stood <unk> by the old portmanteau , with his hands behind him , equally removed , to all appearance , from all three kinds of interest <unk> near the bed — from the young surgeon ’ s professional interest in death , <unk> as being quite apart from his remarks on the deceased as an individual ; from the old man ’ s <unk> ; and the little crazy woman ’ s awe .
His imperturbable face has been as <unk> as his rusty clothes .
One could not even say he has been thinking all this while .
He has shown neither patience nor <unk> , nor attention nor <unk> .
He has shown nothing but his <unk> .
As easily might the tone of a delicate musical instrument be <unk> from its case , as the tone of Mr. Tulkinghorn from his case .
He now interposes , addressing the young surgeon in his unmoved , professional way .
“ I looked in here , ” he observes , “ just before you , with the intention of giving this deceased man , whom I never saw alive , some employment at his trade of copying .
I had heard of him from my stationer — Snagsby of Cook ’ s Court .
Since no one here knows anything about him , it might be as well to send for Snagsby .
Ah ! ” to the little crazy woman , who has often seen him in court , and whom he has often seen , and who proposes , in frightened <unk> , to go for the law-stationer .
“ Suppose you do ! ” While she is gone , the surgeon <unk> his hopeless <unk> and <unk> its subject with the <unk> <unk> .
Mr. Krook and he <unk> a word or two .
Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing , but stands , ever , near the old portmanteau .
Mr. Snagsby arrives hastily in his grey coat and his black sleeves .
“ Dear me , dear me , ” he says ; “ and it has come to this , has it !
Bless my soul ! ” “ Can you give the person of the house any information about this unfortunate creature , Snagsby ? ” inquires Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ He was in <unk> with his rent , it seems .
And he must be buried , you know . ” “ Well , sir , ” says Mr. Snagsby , coughing his apologetic cough behind his hand , “ I really don ’ t know what advice I could offer , except sending for the beadle . ” “ I don ’ t speak of advice , ” returns Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ I could advise — ” “ No one better , sir , I am sure , ” says Mr. Snagsby , with his deferential cough .
“ I speak of <unk> some clue to his connexions , or to where he came from , or to anything concerning him . ” “ I assure you , sir , ” says Mr. Snagsby after <unk> his reply with his cough of general <unk> , “ that I no more know where he came from than I know — ” “ Where he has gone to , perhaps , ” suggests the surgeon to help him out .
A pause .
Mr. Tulkinghorn looking at the law-stationer .
Mr. Krook , with his mouth open , looking for somebody to speak next .
“ As to his connexions , sir , ” says Mr. Snagsby , “ if a person was to say to me , ‘ Snagsby , here ’ s twenty thousand pound down , ready for you in the <unk> of England if you ’ ll only name one of ’ em , ’ I couldn ’ t do it , sir !
About a year and a half ago — to the best of my belief , at the time when he first came to lodge at the present rag and bottle shop — ” “ That was the time ! ” says Krook with a nod .
“ About a year and a half ago , ” says Mr. Snagsby , strengthened , “ he came into our place one morning after breakfast , and finding my little woman ( which I name Mrs. Snagsby when I use that <unk> ) in our shop , produced a <unk> of his handwriting and gave her to understand that he was in want of copying work to do and was , not to put too fine a point upon it , ” a favourite apology for plain speaking with Mr. Snagsby , which he always offers with a sort of <unk> <unk> , “ hard up !
My little woman is not in general partial to <unk> , particular — not to put too fine a point upon it — when they want anything .
But she was rather took by something about this person , whether by his being <unk> , or by his hair being in want of attention , or by what other ladies ’ reasons , I leave you to judge ; and she accepted of the <unk> , and likewise of the address .
My little woman hasn ’ t a good ear for names , ” proceeds Mr. Snagsby after consulting his cough of consideration behind his hand , “ and she considered Nemo equally the same as Nimrod .
In consequence of which , she got into a habit of saying to me at <unk> , ‘ Mr.
Snagsby , you haven ’ t found Nimrod any work yet ! ’ or ‘ Mr.
Snagsby , why didn ’ t you give that eight and thirty Chancery <unk> in Jarndyce to Nimrod ? ’ or such like .
And that is the way he gradually fell into <unk> at our place ; and that is the most I know of him except that he was a quick hand , and a hand not sparing of <unk> , and that if you gave him out , say , five and forty <unk> on the Wednesday night , you would have it brought in on the <unk> morning .
All of which — ” Mr. Snagsby concludes by politely <unk> with his hat towards the bed , as much as to add , “ I have no doubt my honourable friend would confirm if he were in a condition to do it . ” “ Hadn ’ t you better see , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn to Krook , “ whether he had any papers that may <unk> you ?
There will be an inquest , and you will be asked the question .
You can read ? ” “ No , I can ’ t , ” returns the old man with a sudden <unk> .
“ Snagsby , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “ look over the room for him .
He will get into some trouble or difficulty otherwise .
Being here , I ’ ll wait if you make haste , and then I can <unk> on his behalf , if it should ever be necessary , that all was fair and right .
If you will hold the candle for Mr. Snagsby , my friend , he ’ ll soon see whether there is anything to help you . ” “ In the first place , here ’ s an old portmanteau , sir , ” says Snagsby .
Ah , to be sure , so there is !
Mr. Tulkinghorn does not appear to have seen it before , though he is standing so close to it , and though there is very little else , heaven knows .
The <unk> <unk> holds the light , and the law-stationer <unk> the search .
The surgeon leans against the corner of the chimney-piece ; Miss Flite peeps and <unk> just within the door .
The apt old <unk> of the old school , with his dull black <unk> tied with <unk> at the knees , his large black waistcoat , his <unk> black coat , and his <unk> of limp white <unk> tied in the bow the peerage knows so well , stands in exactly the same place and attitude .
There are some <unk> articles of <unk> in the old portmanteau ; there is a bundle of <unk> ’ <unk> , those <unk> <unk> on the road of <unk> ; there is a <unk> paper , <unk> of opium , on which are <unk> rough <unk> — as , took , such a day , so many <unk> ; took , such another day , so many more — begun some time ago , as if with the intention of being regularly continued , but soon left off .
There are a few dirty scraps of newspapers , all referring to <unk> ’ <unk> ; there is nothing else .
They search the cupboard and the drawer of the <unk> table .
There is not a morsel of an old letter or of any other writing in either .
The young surgeon examines the dress on the law-writer .
A knife and some odd halfpence are all he finds .
Mr. Snagsby ’ s <unk> is the practical <unk> after all , and the beadle must be called in .
So the little crazy lodger goes for the beadle , and the rest come out of the room .
“ Don ’ t leave the cat there ! ” says the surgeon ; “ that won ’ t do ! ” Mr. Krook therefore drives her out before him , and she goes <unk> downstairs , winding her <unk> <unk> and <unk> her lips .
“ Good night ! ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , and goes home to Allegory and <unk> .
By this time the news has got into the court .
<unk> of its inhabitants <unk> to <unk> the thing , and the <unk> of the army of observation ( principally boys ) are pushed forward to Mr. Krook ’ s window , which they closely <unk> .
A policeman has already walked up to the room , and walked down again to the door , where he stands like a tower , only condescending to see the boys at his base occasionally ; but whenever he does see them , they <unk> and fall back .
Mrs. Perkins , who has not been for some weeks on speaking terms with Mrs. Piper in consequence for an <unk> <unk> in young Perkins ’ having “ fetched ” young Piper “ a <unk> , ” <unk> her friendly <unk> on this <unk> occasion .
The <unk> at the corner , who is a <unk> amateur , as possessing official knowledge of life and having to deal with <unk> men occasionally , <unk> confidential <unk> with the policeman and has the appearance of an <unk> youth , <unk> by <unk> and <unk> in <unk> .
People talk across the court out of window , and <unk> <unk> come <unk> in from Chancery Lane to know what ’ s the matter .
The general feeling seems to be that it ’ s a blessing Mr. Krook warn ’ t made away with first , mingled with a little natural disappointment that he was not .
In the midst of this sensation , the beadle arrives .
The beadle , though generally understood in the neighbourhood to be a ridiculous <unk> , is not without a certain <unk> for the moment , if it were only as a man who is going to see the body .
The policeman considers him an imbecile <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> times , but gives him admission as something that must be borne with until government shall <unk> him .
The sensation is <unk> as the <unk> spread from mouth to mouth that the beadle is on the ground and has gone in .
By and by the beadle comes out , once more <unk> the sensation , which has rather <unk> in the interval .
He is understood to be in want of witnesses for the inquest to-morrow who can tell the coroner and jury anything whatever respecting the deceased .
Is immediately referred to innumerable people who can tell nothing whatever .
Is made more imbecile by being constantly informed that Mrs. <unk> ’ s son “ was a law-writer <unk> and <unk> him better than anybody , ” which son of Mrs. <unk> ’ s appears , on inquiry , to be at the present time <unk> a vessel bound for China , three months out , but considered <unk> by <unk> on application to the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> goes into various shops and <unk> , examining the inhabitants , always shutting the door first , and by <unk> , delay , and general <unk> <unk> the public .
<unk> seen to smile to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> interest and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the beadle in shrill youthful voices with having <unk> a boy , <unk> fragments of a popular song to that effect and <unk> that the boy was made into <unk> for the <unk> .
<unk> at last finds it necessary to support the law and <unk> a vocalist , who is released upon the flight of the rest on condition of his getting out of this then , come , and cutting it — a condition he immediately observes .
So the sensation dies off for the time ; and the unmoved policeman ( to whom a little opium , more or less , is nothing ) , with his shining hat , stiff stock , inflexible <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and all things <unk> , pursues his <unk> way with a heavy tread , beating the <unk> of his white gloves one against the other and stopping now and then at a <unk> to look casually about for anything between a lost child and a murder .
Under cover of the night , the <unk> beadle comes <unk> about Chancery Lane with his <unk> , in which every <unk> ’ s name is <unk> <unk> , and nothing <unk> <unk> but the beadle ’ s own name , which nobody can read or wants to know .
The <unk> served and his witnesses <unk> , the beadle goes to Mr. Krook ’ s to keep a small appointment he has made with certain <unk> , who , presently arriving , are conducted upstairs , where they leave the great eyes in the <unk> something new to stare at , in that last shape which earthly lodgings take for No one — and for Every one .
And all that night the <unk> stands ready by the old portmanteau ; and the lonely figure on the bed , whose path in life has <unk> through five and forty years , lies there with no more track behind him that any one can trace than a deserted infant .
Next day the court is all alive — is like a fair , as Mrs. Perkins , more than <unk> to Mrs. Piper , says in <unk> conversation with that excellent woman .
The coroner is to sit in the <unk> room at the Sol ’ s Arms , where the Harmonic <unk> take place twice a week and where the chair is filled by a gentleman of professional <unk> , <unk> by Little Swills , the <unk> vocalist , who hopes ( according to the bill in the window ) that his friends will rally round him and support first-rate talent .
The Sol ’ s Arms does a <unk> <unk> of business all the morning .
Even children so require <unk> under the general excitement that a <unk> who has established himself for the occasion at the corner of the court says his <unk> go off like smoke .
What time the beadle , hovering between the door of Mr. Krook ’ s establishment and the door of the Sol ’ s Arms , shows the curiosity in his keeping to a few <unk> spirits and <unk> the compliment of a glass of <unk> or so in return .
At the appointed hour arrives the coroner , for whom the jurymen are waiting and who is received with a salute of <unk> from the good dry <unk> attached to the Sol ’ s Arms .
The coroner <unk> more <unk> than any man alive .
The smell of <unk> , beer , <unk> , and spirits is <unk> in his <unk> from death in its most awful shapes .
He is conducted by the beadle and the landlord to the Harmonic Meeting Room , where he puts his hat on the piano and takes a <unk> at the head of a long table formed of several short tables put together and <unk> with <unk> rings in <unk> <unk> , made by pots and glasses .
As many of the jury as can crowd together at the table sit there .
The rest get among the <unk> and pipes or lean against the piano .
Over the coroner ’ s head is a small iron <unk> , the <unk> handle of a bell , which rather gives the <unk> of the court the appearance of going to be hanged presently .
Call over and <unk> the jury !
While the ceremony is in progress , sensation is created by the entrance of a <unk> little man in a large <unk> , with a <unk> eye and an <unk> nose , who modestly takes a position near the door as one of the general public , but seems familiar with the room too .
A whisper <unk> that this is Little Swills .
It is considered not unlikely that he will get up an imitation of the coroner and make it the principal feature of the Harmonic Meeting in the evening .
“ Well , gentlemen — ” the coroner begins .
“ <unk> there , will you ! ” says the beadle .
Not to the coroner , though it might appear so .
“ Well , gentlemen , ” resumes the coroner .
“ You are <unk> here to inquire into the death of a certain man .
<unk> will be given before you as to the circumstances attending that death , and you will give your <unk> according to the — <unk> ; they must be stopped , you know , beadle ! — evidence , and not according to anything else .
The first thing to be done is to view the body . ” “ Make way there ! ” cries the beadle .
So they go out in a loose procession , something after the manner of a <unk> funeral , and make their <unk> in Mr. Krook ’ s back second floor , from which a few of the jurymen retire pale and <unk> .
The beadle is very careful that two gentlemen not very neat about the <unk> and buttons ( for whose <unk> he has provided a special little table near the coroner in the Harmonic Meeting Room ) should see all that is to be seen .
For they are the public <unk> of such inquiries by the line ; and he is not superior to the <unk> human <unk> , but hopes to read in print what “ <unk> , the active and intelligent beadle of the <unk> , ” said and did and even <unk> to see the name of <unk> as <unk> and <unk> mentioned as the name of the <unk> is , according to the <unk> <unk> .
Little Swills is waiting for the coroner and jury on their return .
Mr. Tulkinghorn , also .
Mr. Tulkinghorn is received with distinction and seated near the coroner between that high <unk> officer , a <unk> , and the <unk> .
The inquiry proceeds .
The jury learn how the subject of their inquiry died , and learn no more about him .
“ A very eminent solicitor is in attendance , gentlemen , ” says the coroner , “ who , I am informed , was accidentally present when discovery of the death was made , but he could only repeat the evidence you have already heard from the surgeon , the landlord , the lodger , and the law-stationer , and it is not necessary to trouble him .
Is anybody in attendance who knows anything more ? ” Mrs. Piper pushed forward by Mrs. Perkins .
Mrs. Piper <unk> .
<unk> Piper , gentlemen .
<unk> woman .
Now , Mrs. Piper , what have you got to say about this ?
Why , Mrs. Piper has a good deal to say , chiefly in <unk> and without <unk> , but not much to tell .
Mrs. Piper lives in the court ( which her husband is a <unk> ) , and it has long been well <unk> among the neighbours ( <unk> from the day next but one before the <unk> of <unk> James Piper aged eighteen months and four days old on accounts of not being expected to live such was the <unk> gentlemen of that child in his <unk> ) as the plaintive — so Mrs. Piper <unk> on calling the deceased — was reported to have sold himself .
<unk> it was the plaintive ’ s air in which that report <unk> .
See the plaintive often and considered as his air was <unk> and not to be allowed to go about some children being timid ( and if doubted hoping Mrs. Perkins may be brought <unk> for she is here and will do credit to her husband and herself and family ) .
Has seen the plaintive <unk> and <unk> by the children ( for children they will ever be and you cannot expect them <unk> if of playful <unk> to be <unk> which you was not yourself ) .
On accounts of this and his dark looks has often dreamed as she see him take a <unk> from his pocket and <unk> <unk> ’ s head ( which the child knows not fear and has <unk> called after him close at his <unk> ) .
Never however see the plaintive take a <unk> or any other <unk> far from it .
Has seen him hurry away when run and called after as if not partial to children and never see him speak to neither child nor grown person at any time ( excepting the boy that sweeps the crossing down the lane over the way round the corner which if he was here would tell you that he has been seen <unk> to him frequent ) .
Says the coroner , is that boy here ?
Says the beadle , no , sir , he is not here .
Says the coroner , go and fetch him then .
In the absence of the active and intelligent , the coroner <unk> with Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Oh !
Here ’ s the boy , gentlemen !
Here he is , very muddy , very <unk> , very ragged .
Now , boy !
But stop a minute .
<unk> .
This boy must be put through a few <unk> paces .
Name , Jo .
Nothing else that he knows on .
Don ’ t know that everybody has two names .
Never heerd of <unk> a think .
Don ’ t know that Jo is short for a longer name .
<unk> it long enough for HIM .
HE don ’ t find no fault with it .
<unk> it ?
No .
HE can ’ t <unk> it .
No father , no mother , no friends .
Never been to school .
What ’ s home ?
<unk> a broom ’ s a broom , and knows it ’ s wicked to tell a lie .
Don ’ t recollect who told him about the broom or about the lie , but knows both .
Can ’ t exactly say what ’ ll be done to him <unk> he ’ s dead if he tells a lie to the gentlemen here , but believes it ’ ll be something wery bad to <unk> him , and serve him right — and so he ’ ll tell the truth .
“ This won ’ t do , gentlemen ! ” says the coroner with a melancholy shake of the head .
“ Don ’ t you think you can receive his evidence , sir ? ” asks an attentive <unk> .
“ Out of the question , ” says the coroner .
“ You have heard the boy .
‘ Can ’ t exactly say ’ won ’ t do , you know .
We can ’ t take THAT in a court of justice , gentlemen .
It ’ s terrible <unk> .
Put the boy aside . ” <unk> put aside , to the great <unk> of the audience , especially of Little Swills , the <unk> vocalist .
Now .
Is there any other witness ?
No other witness .
Very well , gentlemen !
Here ’ s a man unknown , proved to have been in the habit of taking opium in large <unk> for a year and a half , found dead of too much opium .
If you think you have any evidence to lead you to the conclusion that he committed <unk> , you will come to that conclusion .
If you think it is a case of accidental death , you will find a <unk> accordingly .
<unk> accordingly .
<unk> death .
No doubt .
Gentlemen , you are discharged .
Good afternoon .
While the coroner buttons his <unk> , Mr. Tulkinghorn and he give private audience to the <unk> witness in a corner .
That <unk> creature only knows that the dead man ( whom he recognized just now by his yellow face and black hair ) was sometimes <unk> and pursued about the streets .
That one cold winter night when he , the boy , was shivering in a doorway near his crossing , the man turned to look at him , and came back , and having <unk> him and found that he had not a friend in the world , said , “ Neither have I.
Not one ! ” and gave him the price of a supper and a night ’ s lodging .
That the man had often spoken to him since and asked him whether he slept sound at night , and how he bore cold and <unk> , and whether he ever wished to die , and similar strange questions .
That when the man had no money , he would say in passing , “ I am as poor as you to-day , Jo , ” but that when he had any , he had always ( as the boy most heartily believes ) been glad to give him some .
“ He was wery good to me , ” says the boy , wiping his eyes with his wretched sleeve .
“ <unk> I see him <unk> ’ so <unk> out just now , I wished he could have heerd me tell him so .
He wos wery good to me , he wos ! ” As he <unk> downstairs , Mr. Snagsby , lying in wait for him , puts a half-crown in his hand .
“ If you ever see me coming past your crossing with my little woman — I mean a lady — ” says Mr. Snagsby with his finger on his nose , “ don ’ t allude to it ! ” For some little time the jurymen hang about the Sol ’ s Arms <unk> .
In the <unk> , half-a-dozen are caught up in a cloud of <unk> that <unk> the parlour of the Sol ’ s Arms ; two <unk> to <unk> ; and four engage to go <unk> to the play at night , and top up with <unk> .
Little Swills is treated on several hands .
Being asked what he thinks of the proceedings , <unk> them ( his strength lying in a <unk> direction ) as “ a <unk> start . ” The landlord of the Sol ’ s Arms , finding Little Swills so popular , <unk> him highly to the jurymen and public , observing that for a song in character he don ’ t know his equal and that that man ’ s <unk> would fill a cart .
Thus , gradually the Sol ’ s Arms <unk> into the shadowy night and then <unk> out of it strong in gas .
The Harmonic Meeting hour arriving , the gentleman of professional <unk> takes the chair , is <unk> ( <unk> ) by Little Swills ; their friends rally round them and support first-rate talent .
In the <unk> of the evening , Little Swills says , “ Gentlemen , if you ’ ll <unk> me , I ’ ll attempt a short description of a scene of real life that came off here to-day . ” Is much <unk> and encouraged ; goes out of the room as Swills ; comes in as the coroner ( not the least in the world like him ) ; <unk> the inquest , with <unk> intervals of <unk> <unk> , to the <unk> : With his ( the coroner ’ s ) <unk> <unk> <unk> doll , <unk> <unk> <unk> doll , <unk> <unk> <unk> doll , <unk> !
The <unk> piano at last is silent , and the Harmonic friends rally round their pillows .
Then there is rest around the lonely figure , now laid in its last earthly <unk> ; and it is watched by the gaunt eyes in the shutters through some quiet hours of night .
If this <unk> man could have been <unk> seen lying here by the mother at whose breast he <unk> , a little child , with eyes <unk> to her loving face , and soft hand scarcely knowing how to close upon the neck to which it crept , what an <unk> the <unk> would have seemed !
Oh , if in brighter days the <unk> fire within him ever <unk> for one woman who held him in her heart , where is she , while these ashes are above the ground !
It is anything but a night of rest at Mr. Snagsby ’ s , in Cook ’ s Court , where Guster <unk> sleep by going , as Mr. Snagsby himself <unk> — not to put too fine a point upon it — out of one fit into twenty .
The occasion of this <unk> is that Guster has a tender heart and a susceptible something that possibly might have been imagination , but for <unk> and her patron saint .
Be it what it may , now , it was so <unk> impressed at <unk> by Mr. Snagsby ’ s account of the inquiry at which he had assisted that at <unk> she <unk> herself into the kitchen , preceded by a flying <unk> <unk> , and fell into a fit of unusual <unk> , which she only came out of to go into another , and another , and so on through a chain of fits , with short intervals between , of which she has <unk> <unk> herself by <unk> them in entreaties to Mrs. Snagsby not to give her warning “ when she quite comes to , ” and also in <unk> to the whole establishment to lay her down on the stones and go to bed .
Hence , Mr. Snagsby , at last hearing the cock at the little <unk> in Cursitor Street go into that disinterested <unk> of his on the subject of daylight , says , drawing a long breath , though the most patient of men , “ I thought you was dead , I am sure ! ” What question this <unk> <unk> supposes he <unk> when he <unk> himself to such an extent , or why he should thus crow ( so men crow on various triumphant public occasions , however ) about what cannot be of any moment to him , is his affair .
It is enough that daylight comes , morning comes , noon comes .
Then the active and intelligent , who has got into the morning papers as such , comes with his <unk> company to Mr. Krook ’ s and bears off the body of our dear brother here departed to a <unk> churchyard , <unk> and <unk> , whence <unk> <unk> are communicated to the bodies of our dear brothers and sisters who have not departed , while our dear brothers and sisters who hang about official <unk> — would to heaven they HAD departed ! — are very complacent and agreeable .
Into a <unk> scrap of ground which a <unk> would <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> would shudder at , they bring our dear brother here departed to receive Christian <unk> .
With houses looking on , on every side , save where a <unk> little <unk> of a court gives access to the iron gate — with every <unk> of life in action close on death , and every <unk> <unk> of death in action close on life — here they lower our dear brother down a foot or two , here <unk> him in <unk> , to be raised in <unk> : an <unk> ghost at many a <unk> , a <unk> testimony to future ages how <unk> and <unk> walked this <unk> <unk> together .
Come night , come darkness , for you cannot come too soon or stay too long by such a place as this !
Come , <unk> lights into the windows of the ugly houses ; and you who do <unk> <unk> , do it at least with this dread scene shut out !
Come , <unk> of gas , burning so <unk> above the iron gate , on which the <unk> air deposits its <unk> <unk> to the touch !
It is well that you should call to every <unk> , “ Look here ! ” With the night comes a <unk> figure through the <unk> to the outside of the iron gate .
It holds the gate with its hands and looks in between the bars , stands looking in for a little while .
It then , with an old broom it carries , softly sweeps the step and makes the archway clean .
It does so very busily and <unk> , looks in again a little while , and so departs .
Jo , is it <unk> ?
Well , well !
Though a <unk> witness , who “ can ’ t exactly say ” what will be done to him in greater hands than men ’ s , <unk> art not quite in outer darkness .
There is something like a distant ray of light in thy <unk> reason for this : “ He wos wery good to me , he wos ! ” CHAPTER <unk> On the Watch It has left off <unk> down in Lincolnshire at last , and Chesney Wold has taken heart .
Mrs. Rouncewell is full of hospitable cares , for Sir Leicester and my Lady are coming home from Paris .
The fashionable intelligence has found it out and <unk> the glad <unk> to <unk> England .
It has also found out that they will entertain a brilliant and distinguished circle of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ( the fashionable intelligence is weak in English , but a giant refreshed in French ) at the ancient and hospitable family seat in Lincolnshire .
For the greater honour of the brilliant and distinguished circle , and of Chesney Wold into the bargain , the broken arch of the bridge in the park is <unk> ; and the water , now retired within its proper limits and again <unk> <unk> , makes a figure in the prospect from the house .
The clear , cold sunshine glances into the <unk> woods and <unk> beholds the sharp wind <unk> the leaves and drying the moss .
It glides over the park after the moving shadows of the clouds , and <unk> them , and never catches them , all day .
It looks in at the windows and touches the <unk> portraits with bars and <unk> of brightness never contemplated by the <unk> .
<unk> the picture of my Lady , over the great chimney-piece , it throws a broad <unk> of light that strikes down <unk> into the hearth and seems to <unk> it .
Through the same cold sunshine and the same sharp wind , my Lady and Sir Leicester , in their travelling <unk> ( my Lady ’ s woman and Sir Leicester ’ s man affectionate in the <unk> ) , start for home .
With a considerable amount of <unk> and <unk> , and many plunging <unk> on the part of two <unk> horses and two <unk> with <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> and <unk> , they rattle out of the yard of the <unk> <unk> in the Place <unk> and canter between the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> de <unk> and the garden of the ill-fated <unk> of a <unk> king and queen , off by the Place of <unk> , and the <unk> Fields , and the <unk> of the <unk> , out of Paris .
<unk> to say , they cannot go away too fast , for even here my Lady Dedlock has been bored to death .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , theatre , drive , nothing is new to my Lady under the <unk> <unk> .
Only last Sunday , when poor <unk> were gay — within the walls playing with children among the <unk> trees and the <unk> in the <unk> Garden ; walking , a score <unk> , in the <unk> Fields , made more <unk> by performing dogs and wooden horses ; between <unk> <unk> ( a few ) through the gloomy <unk> of Our Lady to say a word or two at the base of a pillar within <unk> of a rusty little <unk> of <unk> little <unk> ; without the walls <unk> Paris with dancing , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> card and <unk> playing , <unk> , and much murderous refuse , <unk> and <unk> — only last Sunday , my Lady , in the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , almost <unk> her own maid for being in spirits .
She cannot , therefore , go too fast from Paris .
<unk> of soul lies before her , as it lies behind — her <unk> has put a <unk> of it round the whole earth , and it cannot be <unk> — but the <unk> remedy is always to fly from the last place where it has been experienced .
<unk> Paris back into the distance , then , <unk> it for <unk> <unk> and <unk> of wintry trees !
And , when next beheld , let it be some <unk> away , with the <unk> of the <unk> a white speck glittering in the sun , and the city a mere <unk> in a plain — two dark square towers rising out of it , and light and shadow <unk> on it <unk> , like the angels in <unk> ’ s dream !
Sir Leicester is generally in a complacent state , and rarely bored .
When he has nothing else to do , he can always contemplate his own greatness .
It is a considerable advantage to a man to have so <unk> a subject .
After reading his letters , he leans back in his corner of the carriage and generally <unk> his importance to society .
“ You have an unusual amount of correspondence this morning ? ” says my Lady after a long time .
She is fatigued with reading .
Has almost read a page in twenty miles .
“ Nothing in it , though .
Nothing whatever . ” “ I saw one of Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s long <unk> , I think ? ” “ You see everything , ” says Sir Leicester with admiration .
“ Ha ! ” <unk> my Lady .
“ He is the most tiresome of men ! ” “ He sends — I really beg your pardon — he sends , ” says Sir Leicester , <unk> the letter and <unk> it , “ a message to you .
Our stopping to change horses as I came to his <unk> drove it out of my memory .
I beg you ’ ll excuse me .
He says — ” Sir Leicester is so long in taking out his eye-glass and adjusting it that my Lady looks a little <unk> .
“ He says ‘ In the matter of the right of way — ’ I beg your pardon , that ’ s not the place .
He says — yes !
Here I have it !
He says , ‘ I beg my <unk> compliments to my Lady , who , I hope , has <unk> by the change .
Will you do me the favour to mention ( as it may interest her ) that I have something to tell her on her return in reference to the person who copied the affidavit in the Chancery suit , which so <unk> <unk> her curiosity .
I have seen him . ’ ” My Lady , leaning forward , looks out of her window .
“ That ’ s the message , ” observes Sir Leicester .
“ I should like to walk a little , ” says my Lady , still looking out of her window .
“ Walk ? ” repeats Sir Leicester in a tone of surprise .
“ I should like to walk a little , ” says my Lady with <unk> distinctness .
“ Please to stop the carriage . ” The carriage is stopped , the affectionate man alights from the <unk> , opens the door , and lets down the steps , <unk> to an impatient motion of my Lady ’ s hand .
My Lady alights so quickly and walks away so quickly that Sir Leicester , for all his <unk> politeness , is unable to assist her , and is left behind .
A space of a minute or two has <unk> before he comes up with her .
She smiles , looks very handsome , takes his arm , <unk> with him for a quarter of a mile , is very much bored , and resumes her seat in the carriage .
The rattle and <unk> continue through the greater part of three days , with more or less of <unk> and <unk> , and more or less plunging of <unk> and <unk> horses .
Their courtly politeness to each other at the <unk> where they <unk> is the theme of general admiration .
Though my Lord IS a little aged for my Lady , says <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and though he might be her amiable father , one can see at a glance that they love each other .
One observes my Lord with his white hair , standing , hat in hand , to help my Lady to and from the carriage .
One observes my Lady , how <unk> of my Lord ’ s politeness , with an inclination of her gracious head and the <unk> of her <unk> fingers !
It is <unk> !
The sea has no appreciation of great men , but knocks them about like the small <unk> .
It is habitually hard upon Sir Leicester , whose countenance it <unk> <unk> in the manner of <unk> and in whose aristocratic system it effects a dismal <unk> .
It is the <unk> of Nature to him .
Nevertheless , his dignity gets over it after stopping to <unk> , and he goes on with my Lady for Chesney Wold , lying only one night in London on the way to Lincolnshire .
Through the same cold sunlight , <unk> as the day <unk> , and through the same sharp wind , <unk> as the separate shadows of bare trees gloom together in the woods , and as the Ghost ’ s Walk , touched at the <unk> corner by a pile of fire in the sky , <unk> itself to coming night , they drive into the park .
The <unk> , swinging in their lofty houses in the <unk> avenue , seem to <unk> the question of the <unk> of the carriage as it passes underneath , some <unk> that Sir Leicester and my Lady are come down , some arguing with <unk> who won ’ t admit it , now all <unk> to consider the question disposed of , now all breaking out again in violent <unk> , <unk> by one obstinate and drowsy bird who will <unk> in putting in a last <unk> <unk> .
Leaving them to <unk> and <unk> , the travelling <unk> rolls on to the house , where fires <unk> <unk> through some of the windows , though not through so many as to give an <unk> expression to the darkening <unk> of front .
But the brilliant and distinguished circle will soon do that .
Mrs. Rouncewell is in attendance and receives Sir Leicester ’ s <unk> shake of the hand with a profound curtsy .
“ How do you do , Mrs. Rouncewell ?
I am glad to see you . ” “ I hope I have the honour of <unk> you in good health , Sir Leicester ? ” “ In excellent health , Mrs. Rouncewell . ” “ My Lady is looking <unk> well , ” says Mrs. Rouncewell with another curtsy .
My Lady <unk> , without <unk> <unk> of words , that she is as <unk> well as she can hope to be .
But Rosa is in the distance , behind the housekeeper ; and my Lady , who has not subdued the quickness of her observation , whatever else she may have <unk> , asks , “ Who is that girl ? ” “ A young <unk> of mine , my Lady .
Rosa . ” “ Come here , Rosa ! ” Lady Dedlock beckons her , with even an appearance of interest .
“ Why , do you know how pretty you are , child ? ” she says , touching her shoulder with her two <unk> .
Rosa , very much abashed , says , “ No , if you please , my Lady ! ” and glances up , and glances down , and don ’ t know where to look , but looks all the <unk> .
“ How old are you ? ” “ <unk> , my Lady . ” “ <unk> , ” repeats my Lady thoughtfully .
“ Take care they don ’ t spoil you by <unk> . ” “ Yes , my Lady . ” My Lady <unk> her <unk> cheek with the same delicate <unk> fingers and goes on to the foot of the <unk> staircase , where Sir Leicester pauses for her as her <unk> escort .
A staring old Dedlock in a <unk> , as large as life and as dull , looks as if he didn ’ t know what to make of it , which was probably his general state of mind in the days of <unk> <unk> .
That evening , in the housekeeper ’ s room , Rosa can do nothing but murmur Lady Dedlock ’ s <unk> .
She is so affable , so graceful , so beautiful , so elegant ; has such a sweet voice and such a <unk> touch that Rosa can feel it yet !
Mrs. Rouncewell <unk> all this , not without personal pride , <unk> only the one point of <unk> .
Mrs. Rouncewell is not quite sure as to that .
Heaven forbid that she should say a <unk> in <unk> of any member of that excellent family , above all , of my Lady , whom the whole world <unk> ; but if my Lady would only be “ a little more free , ” not quite so cold and distant , Mrs. Rouncewell thinks she would be more affable .
“ ’ Tis almost a pity , ” Mrs. Rouncewell adds — only “ almost ” because it <unk> on <unk> to suppose that anything could be better than it is , in such an express <unk> as the Dedlock affairs — “ that my Lady has no family .
If she had had a daughter now , a grown young lady , to interest her , I think she would have had the only kind of <unk> she wants . ” “ Might not that have made her still more proud , grandmother ? ” says Watt , who has been home and come back again , he is such a good grandson .
“ More and most , my dear , ” returns the housekeeper with dignity , “ are words it ’ s not my place to use — nor so much as to hear — applied to any <unk> on my Lady . ” “ I beg your pardon , grandmother .
But she is proud , is she not ? ” “ If she is , she has reason to be .
The Dedlock family have always reason to be . ” “ Well , ” says Watt , “ it ’ s to be hoped they line out of their <unk> a certain passage for the common people about pride and <unk> .
<unk> me , grandmother !
Only a joke ! ” “ Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , my dear , are not fit subjects for <unk> . ” “ Sir Leicester is no joke by any means , ” says Watt , “ and I <unk> ask his pardon .
I suppose , grandmother , that even with the family and their guests down here , there is no objection to my <unk> my stay at the Dedlock Arms for a day or two , as any other <unk> might ? ” “ Surely , none in the world , child . ” “ I am glad of that , ” says Watt , “ because I have an <unk> desire to extend my knowledge of this beautiful neighbourhood . ” He happens to glance at Rosa , who looks down and is very shy indeed .
But according to the old <unk> , it should be Rosa ’ s ears that burn , and not her fresh bright cheeks , for my Lady ’ s maid is holding forth about her at this moment with <unk> energy .
My Lady ’ s maid is a Frenchwoman of two and thirty , from somewhere in the <unk> country about <unk> and <unk> , a <unk> brown woman with black hair who would be handsome but for a certain <unk> mouth and general uncomfortable <unk> of face , rendering the <unk> too eager and the <unk> too prominent .
There is something <unk> keen and <unk> about her <unk> , and she has a watchful way of looking out of the corners of her eyes without turning her head which could be pleasantly dispensed with , especially when she is in an ill humour and near <unk> .
Through all the good taste of her dress and little <unk> , these objections so express themselves that she seems to go about like a very neat <unk> imperfectly <unk> .
Besides being accomplished in all the knowledge <unk> to her post , she is almost an <unk> in her acquaintance with the language ; consequently , she is in no want of words to shower upon Rosa for having attracted my Lady ’ s attention , and she <unk> them out with such grim <unk> as she sits at dinner that her companion , the affectionate man , is rather relieved when she arrives at the <unk> stage of that <unk> .
Ha , ha , ha !
She , Hortense , been in my Lady ’ s service since five years and always kept at the distance , and this doll , this <unk> , <unk> — absolutely <unk> — by my Lady on the moment of her arriving at the house !
Ha , ha , ha !
“ And do you know how pretty you are , child ? ” “ No , my Lady . ” You are right there !
“ And how old are you , child !
And take care they do not spoil you by <unk> , child ! ” Oh , how droll !
It is the <unk> thing altogether .
In short , it is such an <unk> thing that Mademoiselle Hortense can ’ t forget it ; but at <unk> for days afterwards , even among her <unk> and others attached in like capacity to the <unk> of visitors , <unk> into silent enjoyment of the joke — an enjoyment expressed , in her own <unk> manner , by an additional <unk> of face , thin <unk> of <unk> lips , and <unk> look , which intense appreciation of humour is frequently reflected in my Lady ’ s mirrors when my Lady is not among them .
All the mirrors in the house are brought into action now , many of them after a long blank .
They reflect handsome faces , <unk> faces , youthful faces , faces of <unk> and ten that will not submit to be old ; the <unk> collection of faces that have come to pass a <unk> week or two at Chesney Wold , and which the fashionable intelligence , a mighty <unk> before the Lord , <unk> with a keen <unk> , from their breaking cover at the Court of St. James ’ s to their being run down to death .
The place in Lincolnshire is all alive .
By day guns and voices are heard ringing in the woods , <unk> and carriages <unk> the park roads , servants and <unk> <unk> the village and the Dedlock Arms .
<unk> by night from distant <unk> in the trees , the row of windows in the long drawing-room , where my Lady ’ s picture <unk> over the great chimney-piece , is like a row of <unk> set in a black <unk> .
On Sunday the <unk> little church is almost warmed by so much <unk> company , and the general flavour of the Dedlock dust is <unk> in delicate <unk> .
The brilliant and distinguished circle <unk> within it no contracted amount of education , sense , courage , honour , beauty , and virtue .
Yet there is something a little wrong about it in <unk> of its immense advantages .
What can it be ?
<unk> ?
There is no King George the <unk> now ( more the pity ) to set the <unk> fashion ; there are no <unk> <unk> <unk> , no <unk> coats , no false <unk> , no <unk> .
There are no <unk> , now , of <unk> <unk> so <unk> , <unk> in <unk> boxes with <unk> of delight and being revived by other <unk> creatures <unk> <unk> <unk> at their <unk> .
There is no <unk> whom it takes four men at once to shake into his <unk> , or who goes to see all the <unk> , or who is troubled with the <unk> of having once consumed a <unk> .
But is there <unk> in the brilliant and distinguished circle notwithstanding , <unk> of a more <unk> sort , that has got below the surface and is doing less harmless things than <unk> itself and stopping its own digestion , to which no <unk> person need particularly object ?
Why , yes .
It cannot be <unk> .
There ARE at Chesney Wold this <unk> week some ladies and gentlemen of the <unk> fashion , who have set up a <unk> — in <unk> , for instance .
Who in mere <unk> want of an emotion have agreed upon a little <unk> talk about the <unk> wanting faith in things in general , meaning in the things that have been tried and found wanting , as though a low fellow should <unk> lose faith in a bad shilling after finding it out !
Who would make the <unk> very <unk> and faithful by putting back the hands upon the clock of time and <unk> a few hundred years of history .
There are also ladies and gentlemen of another fashion , not so new , but very elegant , who have agreed to put a smooth <unk> on the world and to keep down all its <unk> .
For whom everything must be languid and pretty .
Who have found out the <unk> <unk> .
Who are to rejoice at nothing and be sorry for nothing .
Who are not to be disturbed by ideas .
On whom even the fine arts , attending in powder and walking backward like the Lord <unk> , must array themselves in the <unk> ’ and <unk> ’ <unk> of past <unk> and be particularly careful not to be in earnest or to receive any <unk> from the moving age .
Then there is my Lord Boodle , of considerable reputation with his party , who has known what office is and who tells Sir Leicester Dedlock with much gravity , after dinner , that he really does not see to what the present age is <unk> .
A <unk> is not what a <unk> used to be ; the House is not what the House used to be ; even a <unk> is not what it formerly was .
He perceives with astonishment that supposing the present government to be <unk> , the limited choice of the <unk> , in the <unk> of a new <unk> , would lie between Lord Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle — supposing it to be impossible for the <unk> of <unk> to act with <unk> , which may be assumed to be the case in consequence of the <unk> arising out of that affair with <unk> .
Then , giving the Home <unk> and the <unk> of the House of <unk> to <unk> , the <unk> to <unk> , the <unk> to <unk> , and the <unk> Office to <unk> , what are you to do with <unk> ?
You can ’ t offer him the <unk> of the <unk> ; that is reserved for <unk> .
You can ’ t put him in the <unk> and <unk> ; that is hardly good enough for <unk> .
What follows ?
That the country is <unk> , lost , and gone to pieces ( as is made <unk> to the <unk> of Sir Leicester Dedlock ) because you can ’ t provide for <unk> !
On the other hand , the Right Honourable William Buffy , <unk> , <unk> across the table with some one else that the shipwreck of the country — about which there is no doubt ; it is only the manner of it that is in question — is <unk> to <unk> .
If you had done with <unk> what you ought to have done when he first came into Parliament , and had prevented him from going over to <unk> , you would have got him into <unk> with <unk> , you would have had with you the weight <unk> as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> , you would have brought to bear upon the <unk> the wealth of <unk> , you would have got in for three <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and you would have strengthened your administration by the official knowledge and the business habits of <unk> .
All this , instead of being as you now are , dependent on the mere <unk> of <unk> !
As to this point , and as to some minor <unk> , there are <unk> of opinion ; but it is perfectly clear to the brilliant and distinguished circle , all round , that nobody is in question but Boodle and his <unk> , and Buffy and HIS <unk> .
These are the great <unk> for whom the stage is reserved .
A People there are , no doubt — a certain large number of <unk> , who are to be occasionally addressed , and <unk> upon for <unk> and <unk> , as on the <unk> stage ; but Boodle and Buffy , their followers and families , their <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , are the born <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and no others can appear upon the scene for ever and ever .
In this , too , there is perhaps more <unk> at Chesney Wold than the brilliant and distinguished circle will find good for itself in the long run .
For it is , even with the <unk> and <unk> circles , as with the circle the <unk> draws around him — very strange appearances may be seen in active motion outside .
With this difference , that being <unk> and not <unk> , there is the greater danger of their breaking in .
Chesney Wold is quite full <unk> , so full that a burning sense of injury arises in the <unk> of <unk> ladies ’ <unk> , and is not to be <unk> .
Only one room is empty .
It is a <unk> chamber of the third order of merit , plainly but comfortably furnished and having an old-fashioned business air .
It is Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s room , and is never bestowed on anybody else , for he may come at any time .
He is not come yet .
It is his quiet habit to walk across the park from the village in fine weather , to drop into this room as if he had never been out of it since he was last seen there , to request a servant to inform Sir Leicester that he is arrived in case he should be wanted , and to appear ten minutes before dinner in the shadow of the <unk> .
He <unk> in his <unk> with a <unk> <unk> over his head , and has some leads outside on which , any fine morning when he is down here , his black figure may be seen walking before breakfast like a larger species of <unk> .
Every day before dinner , my Lady looks for him in the dusk of the library , but he is not there .
Every day at dinner , my Lady glances down the table for the vacant place that would be waiting to receive him if he had just arrived , but there is no vacant place .
Every night my Lady casually asks her maid , “ Is Mr. Tulkinghorn come ? ” Every night the answer is , “ No , my Lady , not yet . ” One night , while having her hair <unk> , my Lady <unk> herself in deep thought after this reply until she sees her own <unk> face in the opposite glass , and a pair of black eyes curiously observing her .
“ Be so good as to attend , ” says my Lady then , addressing the reflection of Hortense , “ to your business .
You can contemplate your beauty at another time . ” “ Pardon !
It was your <unk> ’ s beauty . ” “ That , ” says my Lady , “ you needn ’ t contemplate at all . ” At length , one afternoon a little before <unk> , when the bright groups of figures which have for the last hour or two <unk> the Ghost ’ s Walk are all dispersed and only Sir Leicester and my Lady remain upon the terrace , Mr. Tulkinghorn appears .
He comes towards them at his usual <unk> pace , which is never quickened , never <unk> .
He wears his usual <unk> <unk> — if it be a <unk> — and carries family secrets in every limb of his body and every <unk> of his dress .
Whether his whole soul is devoted to the great or whether he <unk> them nothing beyond the services he <unk> is his personal secret .
He keeps it , as he keeps the secrets of his clients ; he is his own client in that matter , and will never <unk> himself .
“ How do you do , Mr. Tulkinghorn ? ” says Sir Leicester , giving him his hand .
Mr. Tulkinghorn is quite well .
Sir Leicester is quite well .
My Lady is quite well .
All highly satisfactory .
The lawyer , with his hands behind him , walks at Sir Leicester ’ s side along the terrace .
My Lady walks upon the other side .
“ We expected you before , ” says Sir Leicester .
A gracious observation .
As much as to say , “ Mr.
Tulkinghorn , we remember your existence when you are not here to remind us of it by your presence .
We bestow a fragment of our minds upon you , sir , you see ! ” Mr. Tulkinghorn , <unk> it , inclines his head and says he is much obliged .
“ I should have come down sooner , ” he explains , “ but that I have been much engaged with those matters in the several suits between yourself and Boythorn . ” “ A man of a very <unk> mind , ” observes Sir Leicester with severity .
“ An extremely dangerous person in any community .
A man of a very low character of mind . ” “ He is obstinate , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ It is natural to such a man to be so , ” says Sir Leicester , looking most profoundly obstinate himself .
“ I am not at all surprised to hear it . ” “ The only question is , ” pursues the lawyer , “ whether you will give up anything . ” “ No , sir , ” replies Sir Leicester .
“ Nothing .
I give up ? ” “ I don ’ t mean anything of importance .
That , of course , I know you would not abandon .
I mean any minor point . ” “ Mr.
Tulkinghorn , ” returns Sir Leicester , “ there can be no minor point between myself and Mr. Boythorn .
If I go farther , and observe that I cannot readily <unk> how <unk> right of mine can be a minor point , I speak not so much in reference to myself as an individual as in reference to the family position I have it in charge to maintain . ” Mr. Tulkinghorn inclines his head again .
“ I have now my instructions , ” he says .
“ Mr.
Boythorn will give us a good deal of trouble — ” “ It is the character of such a mind , Mr. Tulkinghorn , ” Sir Leicester interrupts him , “ TO give trouble .
An exceedingly <unk> , <unk> person .
A person who , fifty years ago , would probably have been tried at the Old <unk> for some <unk> proceeding , and severely punished — if not , ” adds Sir Leicester after a moment ’ s pause , “ if not hanged , drawn , and <unk> . ” Sir Leicester appears to discharge his stately breast of a burden in passing this capital sentence , as if it were the next satisfactory thing to having the sentence executed .
“ But night is coming on , ” says he , “ and my Lady will take cold .
My dear , let us go in . ” As they turn towards the <unk> , Lady Dedlock addresses Mr. Tulkinghorn for the first time .
“ You sent me a message respecting the person whose writing I happened to inquire about .
It was like you to remember the circumstance ; I had quite forgotten it .
Your message reminded me of it again .
I can ’ t imagine what association I had with a hand like that , but I surely had some . ” “ You had some ? ” Mr. Tulkinghorn repeats .
“ Oh , yes ! ” returns my Lady carelessly .
“ I think I must have had some .
And did you really take the trouble to find out the writer of that actual thing — what is it ! — affidavit ? ” “ Yes . ” “ How very odd ! ” They pass into a <unk> <unk> on the ground floor , lighted in the day by two deep windows .
It is now twilight .
The fire <unk> brightly on the <unk> wall and <unk> on the <unk> , where , through the cold reflection of the blaze , the <unk> landscape <unk> in the wind and a grey mist <unk> along , the only <unk> besides the waste of clouds .
My Lady <unk> in a great chair in the <unk> , and Sir Leicester takes another great chair opposite .
The lawyer stands before the fire with his hand out at arm ’ s length , shading his face .
He looks across his arm at my Lady .
“ Yes , ” he says , “ I inquired about the man , and found him .
And , what is very strange , I found him — ” “ Not to be any <unk> person , I am afraid ! ” Lady Dedlock languidly <unk> .
“ I found him dead . ” “ Oh , dear me ! ” remonstrated Sir Leicester .
Not so much shocked by the fact as by the fact of the fact being mentioned .
“ I was directed to his lodging — a miserable , <unk> place — and I found him dead . ” “ You will excuse me , Mr. Tulkinghorn , ” observes Sir Leicester .
“ I think the less said — ” “ Pray , Sir Leicester , let me hear the story out ” ( it is my Lady speaking ) .
“ It is quite a story for twilight .
How very shocking !
Dead ? ” Mr. Tulkinghorn <unk> it by another inclination of his head .
“ Whether by his own hand — ” “ Upon my honour ! ” cries Sir Leicester .
“ Really ! ” “ Do let me hear the story ! ” says my Lady .
“ Whatever you desire , my dear .
But , I must say — ” “ No , you mustn ’ t say !
Go on , Mr. Tulkinghorn . ” Sir Leicester ’ s gallantry <unk> the point , though he still feels that to bring this sort of <unk> among the upper classes is really — really — “ I was about to say , ” resumes the lawyer with <unk> calmness , “ that whether he had died by his own hand or not , it was beyond my power to tell you .
I should <unk> that phrase , however , by saying that he had unquestionably died of his own act , though whether by his own <unk> intention or by <unk> can never certainly be known .
The coroner ’ s jury found that he took the <unk> accidentally . ” “ And what kind of man , ” my Lady asks , “ was this <unk> creature ? ” “ Very difficult to say , ” returns the lawyer , shaking his head .
“ He had lived so <unk> and was so neglected , with his <unk> colour and his wild black hair and <unk> , that I should have considered him the <unk> of the common .
The surgeon had a <unk> that he had once been something better , both in appearance and condition . ” “ What did they call the wretched being ? ” “ They called him what he had called himself , but no one knew his name . ” “ Not even any one who had attended on him ? ” “ No one had attended on him .
He was found dead .
In fact , I found him . ” “ Without any clue to anything more ? ” “ Without any ; there was , ” says the lawyer <unk> , “ an old portmanteau , but — No , there were no papers . ” During the utterance of every word of this short <unk> , Lady Dedlock and Mr. Tulkinghorn , without any other <unk> in their <unk> deportment , have looked very steadily at one another — as was natural , perhaps , in the <unk> of so unusual a subject .
Sir Leicester has looked at the fire , with the general expression of the Dedlock on the staircase .
The story being told , he <unk> his stately protest , saying that as it is quite clear that no association in my Lady ’ s mind can possibly be <unk> to this poor wretch ( unless he was a <unk> writer ) , he trusts to hear no more about a subject so far removed from my Lady ’ s station .
“ Certainly , a collection of horrors , ” says my Lady , <unk> up her <unk> and <unk> , “ but they interest one for the moment !
Have the kindness , Mr. Tulkinghorn , to open the door for me . ” Mr. Tulkinghorn does so with deference and holds it open while she passes out .
She passes close to him , with her usual fatigued manner and <unk> grace .
They meet again at dinner — again , next day — again , for many days in succession .
Lady Dedlock is always the same exhausted <unk> , surrounded by <unk> , and <unk> liable to be bored to death , even while <unk> at her own <unk> .
Mr. Tulkinghorn is always the same speechless <unk> of noble <unk> , so <unk> out of place and yet so perfectly at home .
They appear to take as little note of one another as any two people enclosed within the same walls could .
But whether each evermore watches and suspects the other , evermore <unk> of some great reservation ; whether each is evermore prepared at all points for the other , and never to be taken <unk> ; what each would give to know how much the other knows — all this is hidden , for the time , in their own hearts .
CHAPTER <unk> Esther ’ s Narrative We held many <unk> about what Richard was to be , first without Mr. Jarndyce , as he had requested , and afterwards with him , but it was a long time before we seemed to make progress .
Richard said he was ready for anything .
When Mr. Jarndyce doubted whether he might not already be too old to enter the <unk> , Richard said he had thought of that , and perhaps he was .
When Mr. Jarndyce asked him what he thought of the <unk> , Richard said he had thought of that , too , and it wasn ’ t a bad idea .
When Mr. Jarndyce advised him to try and decide within himself whether his old <unk> for the sea was an ordinary <unk> inclination or a strong impulse , Richard answered , Well he really HAD tried very often , and he couldn ’ t make out .
“ How much of this indecision of character , ” Mr. Jarndyce said to me , “ is <unk> on that <unk> heap of <unk> and <unk> on which he has been thrown from his birth , I don ’ t pretend to say ; but that Chancery , among its other sins , is responsible for some of it , I can plainly see .
It has <unk> or confirmed in him a habit of putting off — and trusting to this , that , and the other chance , without knowing what chance — and <unk> everything as unsettled , uncertain , and confused .
The character of much older and <unk> people may be even changed by the circumstances <unk> them .
It would be too much to expect that a boy ’ s , in its <unk> , should be the subject of such influences and escape them . ” I felt this to be true ; though if I may venture to mention what I thought besides , I thought it much to be regretted that Richard ’ s education had not <unk> those influences or directed his character .
He had been eight years at a public school and had learnt , I understood , to make <unk> verses of several sorts in the most <unk> manner .
But I never heard that it had been anybody ’ s business to find out what his natural bent was , or where his <unk> lay , or to <unk> any kind of knowledge to HIM .
HE had been adapted to the verses and had learnt the art of making them to such perfection that if he had remained at school until he was of age , I suppose he could only have gone on making them over and over again unless he had <unk> his education by <unk> how to do it .
Still , although I had no doubt that they were very beautiful , and very improving , and very sufficient for a great many purposes of life , and always remembered all through life , I did doubt whether Richard would not have <unk> by some one <unk> him a little , instead of his <unk> them quite so much .
To be sure , I knew nothing of the subject and do not even now know whether the young gentlemen of <unk> <unk> or <unk> made verses to the same extent — or whether the young gentlemen of any country ever did .
“ I haven ’ t the least idea , ” said Richard , musing , “ what I had better be .
Except that I am quite sure I don ’ t want to go into the <unk> , it ’ s a <unk> . ” “ You have no inclination in Mr. Kenge ’ s way ? ” suggested Mr. Jarndyce .
“ I don ’ t know that , sir ! ” replied Richard .
“ I am fond of <unk> .
<unk> clerks go a good deal on the water .
It ’ s a capital profession ! ” “ <unk> — ” suggested Mr. Jarndyce .
“ That ’ s the thing , sir ! ” cried Richard .
I doubt if he had ever once thought of it before .
“ That ’ s the thing , sir , ” repeated Richard with the greatest enthusiasm .
“ We have got it at last .
<unk>
! ” He was not to be laughed out of it , though he laughed at it heartily .
He said he had chosen his profession , and the more he thought of it , the more he felt that his <unk> was clear ; the art of <unk> was the art of all others for him .
<unk> that he only came to this conclusion because , having never had much chance of finding out for himself what he was <unk> for and having never been guided to the discovery , he was taken by the <unk> idea and was glad to get rid of the trouble of consideration , I wondered whether the <unk> verses often ended in this or whether Richard ’ s was a solitary case .
Mr. Jarndyce took great pains to talk with him seriously and to put it to his good sense not to deceive himself in so important a matter .
Richard was a little grave after these <unk> , but invariably told Ada and me that it was all right , and then began to talk about something else .
“ By heaven ! ” cried Mr. Boythorn , who interested himself strongly in the subject — though I need not say that , for he could do nothing <unk> ; “ I rejoice to find a young gentleman of spirit and gallantry <unk> himself to that noble profession !
The more spirit there is in it , the better for mankind and the worse for those <unk> <unk> and low <unk> who delight in putting that illustrious art at a disadvantage in the world .
By all that is base and <unk> , ” cried Mr. Boythorn , “ the treatment of <unk> <unk> ship is such that I would submit the legs — both legs — of every member of the <unk> <unk> to a compound <unk> and render it a <unk> offence in any <unk> practitioner to set them if the system were not wholly changed in eight and forty hours ! ” “ <unk> ’ t you give them a week ? ” asked Mr. Jarndyce .
“ No ! ” cried Mr. Boythorn <unk> .
“ Not on any consideration !
<unk> and forty hours !
As to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and similar <unk> of <unk> <unk> who <unk> to <unk> such <unk> that , by heaven , they ought to be worked in <unk> <unk> for the short remainder of their miserable existence , if it were only to prevent their <unk> English from <unk> a language spoken in the presence of the sun — as to those <unk> , who <unk> take advantage of the ardour of gentlemen in the pursuit of knowledge to <unk> the <unk> services of the best years of their lives , their long study , and their expensive education with <unk> too small for the acceptance of clerks , I would have the <unk> of every one of them <unk> and their <unk> arranged in <unk> ’ Hall for the contemplation of the whole profession in order that its younger members might understand from actual <unk> , in early life , <unk> thick <unk> may become ! ” He wound up this vehement declaration by looking round upon us with a most agreeable smile and suddenly thundering , “ Ha , ha , ha ! ” over and over again , until anybody else might have been expected to be quite subdued by the exertion .
As Richard still continued to say that he was fixed in his choice after repeated periods for consideration had been <unk> by Mr. Jarndyce and had <unk> , and he still continued to assure Ada and me in the same final manner that it was “ all right , ” it became <unk> to take Mr. Kenge into <unk> .
Mr. Kenge , therefore , came down to dinner one day , and leaned back in his chair , and turned his eye-glasses over and over , and spoke in a <unk> voice , and did exactly what I remembered to have seen him do when I was a little girl .
“ Ah ! ” said Mr. Kenge .
“ Yes .
Well !
A very good profession , Mr. Jarndyce , a very good profession . ” “ The course of study and preparation requires to be <unk> pursued , ” observed my guardian with a glance at Richard .
“ Oh , no doubt , ” said Mr. Kenge .
“ <unk> . ” “ But that being the case , more or less , with all pursuits that are worth much , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , “ it is not a special consideration which another choice would be likely to escape . ” “ Truly , ” said Mr. Kenge .
“ And Mr. Richard Carstone , who has so <unk> <unk> himself in the — shall I say the <unk> shades ? — in which his youth had been passed , will , no doubt , apply the habits , if not the principles and practice , of <unk> in that tongue in which a <unk> was said ( unless I mistake ) to be born , not made , to the more eminently practical field of action on which he enters . ” “ You may rely upon it , ” said Richard in his off-hand manner , “ that I shall go at it and do my best . ” “ Very well , Mr. Jarndyce ! ” said Mr. Kenge , gently nodding his head .
“ Really , when we are assured by Mr. Richard that he means to go at it and to do his best , ” nodding feelingly and smoothly over those expressions , “ I would submit to you that we have only to inquire into the best mode of carrying out the object of his ambition .
Now , with reference to <unk> Mr. Richard with some sufficiently eminent practitioner .
Is there any one in view at present ? ” “ No one , Rick , I think ? ” said my guardian .
“ No one , sir , ” said Richard .
“ Quite so ! ” observed Mr. Kenge .
“ As to situation , now .
Is there any particular feeling on that head ? ” “ <unk> — no , ” said Richard .
“ Quite so ! ” observed Mr. Kenge again .
“ I should like a little variety , ” said Richard ; “ I mean a good <unk> of experience . ” “ Very <unk> , no doubt , ” returned Mr. Kenge .
“ I think this may be easily arranged , Mr. Jarndyce ?
We have only , in the first place , to <unk> a sufficiently <unk> practitioner ; and as soon as we make our want — and shall I add , our <unk> to pay a <unk> ? — known , our only difficulty will be in the <unk> of one from a large number .
We have only , in the second place , to observe those little <unk> which are rendered necessary by our time of life and our being under the <unk> of the court .
We shall soon be — shall I say , in Mr. Richard ’ s own light-hearted manner , ‘ going at it ’ — to our heart ’ s content .
It is a coincidence , ” said Mr. Kenge with a <unk> of melancholy in his smile , “ one of those <unk> which may or may not require an explanation beyond our present limited <unk> , that I have a cousin in the medical profession .
He might be <unk> <unk> by you and might be disposed to <unk> to this proposal .
I can answer for him as little as for you , but he <unk> ! ” As this was an opening in the prospect , it was arranged that Mr. Kenge should see his cousin .
And as Mr. Jarndyce had before proposed to take us to London for a few weeks , it was settled next day that we should make our visit at once and <unk> Richard ’ s business with it .
Mr. Boythorn leaving us within a week , we took up our <unk> at a cheerful lodging near <unk> Street over an <unk> ’ s shop .
London was a great wonder to us , and we were out for hours and hours at a time , seeing the <unk> , which appeared to be less capable of <unk> than we were .
We made the round of the principal <unk> , too , with great delight , and saw all the plays that were worth seeing .
I mention this because it was at the theatre that I began to be made uncomfortable again by Mr. Guppy .
I was sitting in front of the box one night with Ada , and Richard was in the place he liked best , behind Ada ’ s chair , when , <unk> to look down into the pit , I saw Mr. Guppy , with his hair <unk> down upon his head and <unk> <unk> in his face , looking up at me .
I felt all through the <unk> that he never looked at the <unk> but constantly looked at me , and always with a carefully prepared expression of the deepest misery and the <unk> <unk> .
It quite <unk> my pleasure for that night because it was so very <unk> and so very ridiculous .
But from that time forth , we never went to the play without my seeing Mr. Guppy in the pit , always with his hair straight and flat , his <unk> turned down , and a general <unk> about him .
If he were not there when we went in , and I began to hope he would not come and yielded myself for a little while to the interest of the scene , I was certain to encounter his <unk> eyes when I least expected it and , from that time , to be quite sure that they were fixed upon me all the evening .
I really cannot express how uneasy this made me .
If he would only have brushed up his hair or turned up his collar , it would have been bad enough ; but to know that that absurd figure was always <unk> at me , and always in that <unk> state of <unk> , put such a <unk> upon me that I did not like to laugh at the play , or to cry at it , or to move , or to speak .
I seemed able to do nothing naturally .
As to <unk> Mr. Guppy by going to the back of the box , I could not bear to do that because I knew Richard and Ada <unk> on having me next them and that they could never have talked together so happily if anybody else had been in my place .
So there I sat , not knowing where to look — for wherever I looked , I knew Mr. Guppy ’ s eyes were following me — and thinking of the dreadful expense to which this young man was putting himself on my account .
Sometimes I thought of telling Mr. Jarndyce .
Then I feared that the young man would lose his situation and that I might ruin him .
Sometimes I thought of confiding in Richard , but was <unk> by the possibility of his <unk> Mr. Guppy and giving him black eyes .
Sometimes I thought , should I frown at him or shake my head .
Then I felt I could not do it .
Sometimes I considered whether I should write to his mother , but that ended in my being convinced that to open a correspondence would be to make the matter worse .
I always came to the conclusion , finally , that I could do nothing .
Mr. Guppy ’ s perseverance , all this time , not only produced him regularly at any theatre to which we went , but caused him to appear in the crowd as we were coming out , and even to get up behind our fly — where I am sure I saw him , two or three times , <unk> among the most dreadful <unk> .
After we got home , he <unk> a post opposite our house .
The <unk> ’ s where we <unk> being at the corner of two streets , and my bedroom window being opposite the post , I was afraid to go near the window when I went upstairs , lest I should see him ( as I did one moonlight night ) leaning against the post and evidently catching cold .
If Mr. Guppy had not been , <unk> for me , engaged in the <unk> , I really should have had no rest from him .
While we were making this round of <unk> , in which Mr. Guppy so <unk> <unk> , the business which had helped to bring us to town was not neglected .
Mr. Kenge ’ s cousin was a Mr. Bayham Badger , who had a good practice at <unk> and attended a large public <unk> besides .
He was quite willing to receive Richard into his house and to <unk> his studies , and as it seemed that those could be pursued <unk> under Mr. Badger ’ s roof , and Mr. Badger liked Richard , and as Richard said he liked Mr. Badger “ well enough , ” an agreement was made , the Lord Chancellor ’ s consent was <unk> , and it was all settled .
On the day when matters were concluded between Richard and Mr. Badger , we were all under engagement to dine at Mr. Badger ’ s house .
We were to be “ merely a family party , ” Mrs. Badger ’ s note said ; and we found no lady there but Mrs. Badger herself .
She was surrounded in the drawing-room by various objects , <unk> of her <unk> a little , playing the piano a little , playing the <unk> a little , playing the <unk> a little , singing a little , working a little , reading a little , writing poetry a little , and <unk> a little .
She was a lady of about fifty , I should think , <unk> dressed , and of a very fine complexion .
If I add to the little list of her <unk> that she <unk> a little , I do not mean that there was any harm in it .
Mr. Bayham Badger himself was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> gentleman with a weak voice , white teeth , light hair , and surprised eyes , some years younger , I should say , than Mrs. Bayham Badger .
He admired her exceedingly , but principally , and to begin with , on the curious ground ( as it seemed to us ) of her having had three husbands .
We had <unk> taken our seats when he said to Mr. Jarndyce quite triumphantly , “ You would hardly suppose that I am Mrs. Bayham Badger ’ s third ! ” “ Indeed ? ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ Her third ! ” said Mr. Badger .
“ Mrs.
Bayham Badger has not the appearance , Miss Summerson , of a lady who has had two former husbands ? ” I said “ Not at all ! ” “ And most remarkable men ! ” said Mr. Badger in a tone of confidence .
“ Captain Swosser of the Royal <unk> , who was Mrs. Badger ’ s first husband , was a very distinguished officer indeed .
The name of Professor Dingo , my immediate <unk> , is one of <unk> reputation . ” Mrs. Badger overheard him and smiled .
“ Yes , my dear ! ” Mr. Badger replied to the smile , “ I was observing to Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson that you had had two former husbands — both very distinguished men .
And they found it , as people generally do , difficult to believe . ” “ I was <unk> twenty , ” said Mrs. Badger , “ when I married Captain Swosser of the Royal <unk> .
I was in the <unk> with him ; I am quite a sailor .
On the <unk> <unk> of my <unk> , I became the wife of Professor Dingo . ” “ Of <unk> reputation , ” added Mr. Badger in an <unk> .
“ And when Mr. Badger and myself were married , ” pursued Mrs. Badger , “ we were married on the same day of the year .
I had become attached to the day . ” “ So that Mrs. Badger has been married to three husbands — two of them highly distinguished men , ” said Mr. Badger , <unk> up the facts , “ and each time upon the <unk> of <unk> at eleven in the <unk> ! ” We all expressed our admiration .
“ But for Mr. Badger ’ s modesty , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , “ I would take leave to correct him and say three distinguished men . ” “ Thank you , Mr. Jarndyce !
What I always tell him ! ” observed Mrs. Badger .
“ And , my dear , ” said Mr. Badger , “ what do I always tell you ?
That without any <unk> of <unk> such professional distinction as I may have <unk> ( which our friend Mr. Carstone will have many opportunities of <unk> ) , I am not so weak — no , really , ” said Mr. Badger to us generally , “ so unreasonable — as to put my reputation on the same footing with such first-rate men as Captain Swosser and Professor Dingo .
Perhaps you may be interested , Mr. Jarndyce , ” continued Mr. Bayham Badger , leading the way into the next drawing-room , “ in this portrait of Captain Swosser .
It was taken on his return home from the African station , where he had suffered from the fever of the country .
Mrs. Badger considers it too yellow .
But it ’ s a very fine head .
A very fine head ! ” We all echoed , “ A very fine head ! ” “ I feel when I look at it , ” said Mr. Badger , “ ‘ that ’ s a man I should like to have seen ! ’ It <unk> <unk> the <unk> man that Captain Swosser <unk> was .
On the other side , Professor Dingo .
I knew him well — attended him in his last illness — a speaking likeness !
Over the piano , Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs. Swosser .
Over the sofa , Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs. Dingo .
Of Mrs. Bayham Badger <unk> <unk> , I possess the original and have no copy . ” <unk> was now announced , and we went downstairs .
It was a very genteel entertainment , very handsomely served .
But the captain and the professor still ran in Mr. Badger ’ s head , and as Ada and I had the honour of being under his particular care , we had the full <unk> of them .
“ <unk> , Miss Summerson ?
<unk> me !
Not in that <unk> , pray .
Bring me the professor ’ s <unk> , James ! ” Ada very much admired some <unk> flowers under a glass .
“ <unk> how they keep ! ” said Mr. Badger .
“ They were presented to Mrs. Bayham Badger when she was in the <unk> . ” He invited Mr. Jarndyce to take a glass of claret .
“ Not that claret ! ” he said .
“ Excuse me !
This is an occasion , and <unk> an occasion I produce some very special claret I happen to have .
( James , Captain Swosser ’ s wine ! )
Mr. Jarndyce , this is a wine that was <unk> by the captain , we will not say how many years ago .
You will find it very curious .
My dear , I shall be happy to take some of this wine with you .
( Captain Swosser ’ s claret to your mistress , James ! )
My love , your health ! ” After dinner , when we ladies retired , we took Mrs. Badger ’ s first and second husband with us .
Mrs. Badger gave us in the drawing-room a <unk> <unk> of the life and services of Captain Swosser before his marriage and a more minute account of him <unk> from the time when he fell in love with her at a ball on board the <unk> , given to the officers of that ship when she lay in <unk> <unk> .
“ The dear old <unk> ! ” said Mrs. Badger , shaking her head .
“ She was a noble vessel .
<unk> , <unk> , all a <unk> , as Captain Swosser used to say .
You must excuse me if I occasionally <unk> a <unk> expression ; I was quite a sailor once .
Captain Swosser loved that <unk> for my sake .
When she was no longer in commission , he frequently said that if he were rich enough to buy her old <unk> , he would have an inscription let into the <unk> of the <unk> where we stood as <unk> in the dance to mark the spot where he fell — <unk> <unk> and <unk> ( Captain Swosser used to say ) by the fire from my <unk> .
It was his <unk> way of mentioning my eyes . ” Mrs. Badger shook her head , <unk> , and looked in the glass .
“ It was a great change from Captain Swosser to Professor Dingo , ” she resumed with a plaintive smile .
“ I felt it a good deal at first .
Such an <unk> <unk> in my mode of life !
But custom , combined with science — particularly science — <unk> me to it .
Being the professor ’ s sole companion in his <unk> <unk> , I almost forgot that I had ever been <unk> , and became quite learned .
It is singular that the professor was the <unk> of Captain Swosser and that Mr. Badger is not in the least like either ! ” We then passed into a narrative of the deaths of Captain Swosser and Professor Dingo , both of whom seem to have had very bad <unk> .
In the course of it , Mrs. Badger <unk> to us that she had never <unk> loved but once and that the object of that wild affection , never to be recalled in its fresh enthusiasm , was Captain Swosser .
The professor was yet dying by <unk> in the most dismal manner , and Mrs. Badger was giving us <unk> of his way of saying , with great difficulty , “ Where is <unk> ?
Let <unk> give me my toast and water ! ” when the entrance of the gentlemen <unk> him to the <unk> .
Now , I observed that evening , as I had observed for some days past , that Ada and Richard were more than ever attached to each other ’ s society , which was but natural , seeing that they were going to be separated so soon .
I was therefore not very much surprised when we got home , and Ada and I retired upstairs , to find Ada more silent than usual , though I was not quite prepared for her coming into my arms and beginning to speak to me , with her face hidden .
“ My darling Esther ! ” murmured Ada .
“ I have a great secret to tell you ! ” A mighty secret , my pretty one , no doubt !
“ What is it , Ada ? ” “ Oh , Esther , you would never guess ! ” “ Shall I try to guess ? ” said I.
“ Oh , no !
Don ’ t !
Pray don ’ t ! ” cried Ada , very much startled by the idea of my doing so .
“ Now , I wonder who it can be about ? ” said I , pretending to consider .
“ It ’ s about — ” said Ada in a whisper .
“ It ’ s about — my cousin Richard ! ” “ Well , my own ! ” said I , kissing her bright hair , which was all I could see .
“ And what about him ? ” “ Oh , Esther , you would never guess ! ” It was so pretty to have her <unk> to me in that way , <unk> her face , and to know that she was not crying in sorrow but in a little glow of joy , and pride , and hope , that I would not help her just yet .
“ He says — I know it ’ s very foolish , we are both so young — but he says , ” with a burst of tears , “ that he loves me dearly , Esther . ” “ Does he indeed ? ” said I.
“ I never heard of such a thing !
Why , my pet of <unk> , I could have told you that weeks and weeks ago ! ” To see Ada lift up her flushed face in joyful surprise , and hold me round the neck , and laugh , and cry , and <unk> , was so pleasant !
“ Why , my darling , ” said I , “ what a <unk> you must take me for !
Your cousin Richard has been loving you as plainly as he could for I don ’ t know how long ! ” “ And yet you never said a word about it ! ” cried Ada , kissing me .
“ No , my love , ” said I.
“ I waited to be told . ” “ But now I have told you , you don ’ t think it wrong of me , do you ? ” returned Ada .
She might have <unk> me to say no if I had been the <unk> <unk> in the world .
Not being that yet , I said no very freely .
“ And now , ” said I , “ I know the worst of it . ” “ Oh , that ’ s not quite the worst of it , Esther dear ! ” cried Ada , holding me tighter and laying down her face again upon my breast .
“ No ? ” said I.
“ Not even that ? ” “ No , not even that ! ” said Ada , shaking her head .
“ Why , you never mean to say — ” I was beginning in joke .
But Ada , looking up and smiling through her tears , cried , “ Yes , I do !
You know , you know I do ! ” And then sobbed out , “ With all my heart I do !
With all my whole heart , Esther ! ” I told her , laughing , why I had known that , too , just as well as I had known the other !
And we sat before the fire , and I had all the talking to myself for a little while ( though there was not much of it ) ; and Ada was soon quiet and happy .
“ Do you think my cousin John knows , dear Dame Durden ? ” she asked .
“ Unless my cousin John is blind , my pet , ” said I , “ I should think my cousin John knows pretty well as much as we know . ” “ We want to speak to him before Richard goes , ” said Ada timidly , “ and we wanted you to advise us , and to tell him so .
Perhaps you wouldn ’ t mind Richard ’ s coming in , Dame Durden ? ” “ Oh !
Richard is outside , is he , my dear ? ” said I.
“ I am not quite certain , ” returned Ada with a <unk> simplicity that would have won my heart if she had not won it long before , “ but I think he ’ s waiting at the door . ” There he was , of course .
They brought a chair on either side of me , and put me between them , and really seemed to have fallen in love with me instead of one another , they were so confiding , and so <unk> , and so fond of me .
They went on in their own wild way for a little while — I never stopped them ; I enjoyed it too much myself — and then we gradually fell to considering how young they were , and how there must be a <unk> of several years before this early love could come to anything , and how it could come to happiness only if it were real and <unk> and inspired them with a steady resolution to do their duty to each other , with constancy , <unk> , and perseverance , each always for the other ’ s sake .
Well !
Richard said that he would work his fingers to the bone for Ada , and Ada said that she would work her fingers to the bone for Richard , and they called me all sorts of endearing and sensible names , and we sat there , <unk> and talking , half the night .
<unk> , before we parted , I gave them my promise to speak to their cousin John to-morrow .
So , when to-morrow came , I went to my guardian after breakfast , in the room that was our <unk> for the growlery , and told him that I had it in trust to tell him something .
“ Well , little woman , ” said he , shutting up his book , “ if you have accepted the trust , there can be no harm in it . ” “ I hope not , guardian , ” said I.
“ I can <unk> that there is no secrecy in it .
For it only happened yesterday . ” “ Aye ?
And what is it , Esther ? ” “ Guardian , ” said I , “ you remember the happy night when first we came down to Bleak House ?
When Ada was singing in the dark room ? ” I wished to call to his remembrance the look he had given me then .
Unless I am much mistaken , I saw that I did so .
“ Because — ” said I with a little hesitation .
“ Yes , my dear ! ” said he .
“ Don ’ t hurry . ” “ Because , ” said I , “ Ada and Richard have fallen in love .
And have told each other so . ” “ <unk> ! ” cried my guardian , quite astonished .
“ Yes ! ” said I.
“ And to tell you the truth , guardian , I rather expected it . ” “ The <unk> you did ! ” said he .
He sat considering for a minute or two , with his smile , at once so handsome and so kind , upon his changing face , and then requested me to let them know that he wished to see them .
When they came , he <unk> Ada with one arm in his fatherly way and addressed himself to Richard with a cheerful gravity .
“ Rick , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , “ I am glad to have won your confidence .
I hope to preserve it .
When I contemplated these relations between us four which have so brightened my life and so <unk> it with new interests and <unk> , I certainly did contemplate , afar off , the possibility of you and your pretty cousin here ( don ’ t be shy , Ada , don ’ t be shy , my dear ! )
being in a mind to go through life together .
I saw , and do see , many reasons to make it desirable .
But that was afar off , Rick , afar off ! ” “ We look afar off , sir , ” returned Richard .
“ Well ! ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ That ’ s <unk> .
Now , hear me , my dears !
I might tell you that you don ’ t know your own minds yet , that a thousand things may happen to <unk> you from one another , that it is well this chain of flowers you have taken up is very easily broken , or it might become a chain of lead .
But I will not do that .
Such wisdom will come soon enough , I dare say , if it is to come at all .
I will <unk> that a few years hence you will be in your hearts to one another what you are to-day .
All I say before speaking to you according to that <unk> is , if you DO change — if you DO come to find that you are more <unk> cousins to each other as man and woman than you were as boy and girl ( your <unk> will excuse me , Rick !
) — don ’ t be ashamed still to confide in me , for there will be nothing monstrous or uncommon in it .
I am only your friend and distant kinsman .
I have no power over you whatever .
But I wish and hope to retain your confidence if I do nothing to <unk> it . ” “ I am very sure , sir , ” returned Richard , “ that I speak for Ada too when I say that you have the strongest power over us both — rooted in respect , gratitude , and affection — strengthening every day . ” “ Dear cousin John , ” said Ada , on his shoulder , “ my father ’ s place can never be empty again .
All the love and duty I could ever have rendered to him is <unk> to you . ” “ Come ! ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ Now for our <unk> .
Now we lift our eyes up and look hopefully at the distance !
Rick , the world is before you ; and it is most probable that as you enter it , so it will receive you .
Trust in nothing but in <unk> and your own efforts .
Never separate the two , like the heathen waggoner .
<unk> in love is a good thing , but it means nothing , and is nothing , without constancy in every kind of effort .
If you had the <unk> of all the great men , past and present , you could do nothing well without sincerely meaning it and setting about it .
If you entertain the <unk> that any real success , in great things or in small , ever was or could be , ever will or can be , <unk> from <unk> by fits and starts , leave that wrong idea here or leave your cousin Ada here . ” “ I will leave <unk> here , sir , ” replied Richard smiling , “ if I brought it here just now ( but I hope I did not ) , and will work my way on to my cousin Ada in the hopeful distance . ” “ Right ! ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ If you are not to make her happy , why should you pursue her ? ” “ I wouldn ’ t make her unhappy — no , not even for her love , ” retorted Richard <unk> .
“ Well said ! ” cried Mr. Jarndyce .
“ That ’ s well said !
She remains here , in her home with me .
<unk> her , Rick , in your active life , no less than in her home when you <unk> it , and all will go well .
<unk> , all will go ill . That ’ s the end of my <unk> .
I think you and Ada had better take a walk . ” Ada tenderly <unk> him , and Richard heartily shook hands with him , and then the cousins went out of the room , looking back again directly , though , to say that they would wait for me .
The door stood open , and we both followed them with our eyes as they passed down the adjoining room , on which the sun was shining , and out at its farther end .
Richard with his head bent , and her hand drawn through his arm , was talking to her very earnestly ; and she looked up in his face , listening , and seemed to see nothing else .
So young , so beautiful , so full of hope and promise , they went on lightly through the sunlight as their own happy thoughts might then be <unk> the years to come and making them all years of brightness .
So they passed away into the shadow and were gone .
It was only a burst of light that had been so radiant .
The room darkened as they went out , and the sun was <unk> over .
“ Am I right , Esther ? ” said my guardian when they were gone .
He was so good and wise to ask ME whether he was right !
“ Rick may gain , out of this , the quality he wants .
<unk> , at the <unk> of so much that is good ! ” said Mr. Jarndyce , shaking his head .
“ I have said nothing to Ada , Esther .
She has her friend and <unk> always near . ” And he laid his hand <unk> upon my head .
I could not help showing that I was a little moved , though I did all I could to conceal it .
“ <unk> <unk> ! ” said he .
“ But we must take care , too , that our little woman ’ s life is not all consumed in care for others . ” “ <unk> ?
My dear guardian , I believe I am the happiest creature in the world ! ” “ I believe so , too , ” said he .
“ But some one may find out what Esther never will — that the little woman is to be held in remembrance above all other people ! ” I have <unk> to mention in its place that there was some one else at the family dinner party .
It was not a lady .
It was a gentleman .
It was a gentleman of a dark complexion — a young surgeon .
He was rather reserved , but I thought him very sensible and agreeable .
At least , Ada asked me if I did not , and I said yes .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> Richard left us on the very next evening to begin his new career , and committed Ada to my charge with great love for her and great trust in me .
It touched me then to reflect , and it touches me now , more nearly , to remember ( having what I have to tell ) how they both thought of me , even at that <unk> time .
I was a part of all their plans , for the present and the future .
I was to write Richard once a week , making my faithful report of Ada , who was to write to him every <unk> day .
I was to be informed , under his own hand , of all his labours and <unk> ; I was to observe how resolute and <unk> he would be ; I was to be Ada ’ s <unk> when they were married ; I was to live with them afterwards ; I was to keep all the keys of their house ; I was to be made happy for ever and a day .
“ And if the suit <unk> make us rich , Esther — which it may , you know ! ” said Richard to crown all .
A shade crossed Ada ’ s face .
“ My dearest Ada , ” asked Richard , “ why not ? ” “ It had better declare us poor at once , ” said Ada .
“ Oh !
I don ’ t know about that , ” returned Richard , “ but at all events , it won ’ t declare anything at once .
It hasn ’ t <unk> anything in heaven knows how many years . ” “ <unk> true , ” said Ada .
“ Yes , but , ” urged Richard , answering what her look suggested rather than her words , “ the longer it goes on , dear cousin , the nearer it must be to a settlement one way or other .
Now , is not that reasonable ? ” “ You know best , Richard .
But I am afraid if we trust to it , it will make us unhappy . ” “ But , my Ada , we are not going to trust to it ! ” cried Richard gaily .
“ We know it better than to trust to it .
We only say that if it <unk> make us rich , we have no <unk> objection to being rich .
The court is , by solemn settlement of law , our grim old guardian , and we are to suppose that what it gives us ( when it gives us anything ) is our right .
It is not necessary to quarrel with our right . ” “ No , ” said Ada , “ but it may be better to forget all about it . ” “ Well , well , ” cried Richard , “ then we will forget all about it !
We <unk> the whole thing to oblivion .
Dame Durden puts on her approving face , and it ’ s done ! ” “ Dame Durden ’ s approving face , ” said I , looking out of the box in which I was <unk> his books , “ was not very visible when you called it by that name ; but it does approve , and she thinks you can ’ t do better . ” So , Richard said there was an end of it , and immediately began , on no other <unk> , to <unk> as many <unk> in the air as would man the Great <unk> of China .
He went away in high spirits .
Ada and I , prepared to miss him very much , commenced our quieter career .
On our arrival in London , we had called with Mr. Jarndyce at Mrs. Jellyby ’ s but had not been so fortunate as to find her at home .
It appeared that she had gone somewhere to a <unk> and had taken Miss Jellyby with her .
Besides the <unk> , there was to be some considerable <unk> and <unk> on the general merits of the <unk> of coffee , <unk> with natives , at the <unk> of Borrioboola-Gha .
All this involved , no doubt , sufficient active exercise of pen and ink to make her daughter ’ s part in the proceedings anything but a <unk> .
It being now beyond the time appointed for Mrs. Jellyby ’ s return , we called again .
She was in town , but not at home , having gone to <unk> <unk> directly after breakfast on some Borrioboolan business , arising out of a society called the <unk> London <unk> <unk> <unk> .
As I had not seen Peepy on the occasion of our last call ( when he was not to be found anywhere , and when the cook rather thought he must have <unk> away with the <unk> ’ s cart ) , I now inquired for him again .
The oyster <unk> he had been building a house with were still in the passage , but he was nowhere <unk> , and the cook supposed that he had “ gone after the sheep . ” When we repeated , with some surprise , “ The sheep ? ” she said , Oh , yes , on <unk> days he sometimes followed them quite out of town and came back in such a state as never was !
I was sitting at the window with my guardian on the following morning , and Ada was busy writing — of course to Richard — when Miss Jellyby was announced , and entered , leading the <unk> Peepy , whom she had made some endeavours to render <unk> by wiping the dirt into corners of his face and hands and making his hair very wet and then violently <unk> it with her fingers .
Everything the dear child wore was either too large for him or too small .
Among his other <unk> <unk> he had the hat of a <unk> and the little gloves of a baby .
His boots were , on a small scale , the boots of a <unk> , while his legs , so crossed and <unk> with <unk> that they looked like <unk> , were bare below a very short pair of <unk> <unk> finished off with two <unk> of perfectly different <unk> .
The deficient buttons on his <unk> frock had evidently been <unk> from one of Mr. Jellyby ’ s coats , they were so extremely <unk> and so much too large .
Most extraordinary specimens of needlework appeared on several parts of his dress , where it had been hastily <unk> , and I recognized the same hand on Miss Jellyby ’ s .
She was , however , <unk> improved in her appearance and looked very pretty .
She was conscious of poor little Peepy being but a failure after all her trouble , and she showed it as she came in by the way in which she glanced first at him and then at us .
“ Oh , dear me ! ” said my guardian .
“ <unk> east ! ” Ada and I gave her a cordial welcome and presented her to Mr. Jarndyce , to whom she said as she sat down , “ Ma ’ s compliments , and she hopes you ’ ll excuse her , because she ’ s correcting <unk> of the plan .
She ’ s going to put out five thousand new <unk> , and she knows you ’ ll be interested to hear that .
I have brought one of them with me .
Ma ’ s compliments . ” With which she presented it <unk> enough .
“ Thank you , ” said my guardian .
“ I am much obliged to Mrs. Jellyby .
Oh , dear me !
This is a very trying wind ! ” We were busy with Peepy , taking off his <unk> hat , asking him if he remembered us , and so on .
Peepy retired behind his elbow at first , but <unk> at the sight of <unk> and allowed me to take him on my lap , where he sat <unk> quietly .
Mr. Jarndyce then withdrawing into the temporary growlery , Miss Jellyby opened a conversation with her usual <unk> .
“ We are going on just as bad as ever in Thavies Inn , ” said she .
“ I have no peace of my life .
<unk> of Africa !
I couldn ’ t be worse off if I was a what ’ <unk> — man and a brother ! ” I tried to say something <unk> .
“ Oh , it ’ s of no use , Miss Summerson , ” exclaimed Miss Jellyby , “ though I thank you for the kind intention all the same .
I know how I am used , and I am not to be talked over .
YOU wouldn ’ t be talked over if you were used so .
Peepy , go and play at <unk> <unk> under the piano ! ” “ I <unk> ’ t ! ” said Peepy .
“ Very well , you ungrateful , <unk> , <unk> boy ! ” returned Miss Jellyby with tears in her eyes .
“ I ’ ll never take pains to dress you any more . ” “ Yes , I will go , Caddy ! ” cried Peepy , who was really a good child and who was so moved by his sister ’ s vexation that he went at once .
“ It seems a little thing to cry about , ” said poor Miss Jellyby <unk> , “ but I am quite worn out .
I was directing the new <unk> till two this morning .
I <unk> the whole thing so that that alone makes my head ache till I can ’ t see out of my eyes .
And look at that poor unfortunate child !
Was there ever such a fright as he is ! ” Peepy , happily unconscious of the <unk> in his appearance , sat on the carpet behind one of the legs of the piano , looking calmly out of his <unk> at us while he <unk> his <unk> .
“ I have sent him to the other end of the room , ” observed Miss Jellyby , drawing her chair nearer ours , “ because I don ’ t want him to hear the conversation .
Those little things are so sharp !
I was going to say , we really are going on worse than ever .
Pa will be a <unk> before long , and then I hope Ma will be satisfied .
There ’ ll be nobody but Ma to thank for it . ” We said we hoped Mr. Jellyby ’ s affairs were not in so bad a state as that .
“ It ’ s of no use hoping , though it ’ s very kind of you , ” returned Miss Jellyby , shaking her head .
“ Pa told me only yesterday morning ( and dreadfully unhappy he is ) that he couldn ’ t weather the storm .
I should be surprised if he could .
When all our <unk> send into our house any stuff they like , and the servants do what they like with it , and I have no time to improve things if I knew how , and Ma don ’ t care about anything , I should like to make out how Pa is to weather the storm .
I declare if I was Pa , I ’ d run away . ” “ My dear ! ” said I , smiling .
“ Your papa , no doubt , considers his family . ” “ Oh , yes , his family is all very fine , Miss Summerson , ” replied Miss Jellyby ; “ but what comfort is his family to him ?
His family is nothing but bills , dirt , waste , noise , <unk> downstairs , confusion , and <unk> .
His <unk> home , from week ’ s end to week ’ s end , is like one great <unk> — only nothing ’ s washed ! ” Miss Jellyby tapped her foot upon the floor and <unk> her eyes .
“ I am sure I pity Pa to that degree , ” she said , “ and am so angry with Ma that I can ’ t find words to express myself !
However , I am not going to bear it , I am determined .
I won ’ t be a <unk> all my life , and I won ’ t submit to be proposed to by Mr. Quale .
A pretty thing , indeed , to marry a <unk> .
As if I hadn ’ t had enough of THAT ! ” said poor Miss Jellyby .
I must confess that I could not help feeling rather angry with Mrs. Jellyby myself , seeing and hearing this neglected girl and knowing how much of bitterly <unk> truth there was in what she said .
“ If it wasn ’ t that we had been <unk> when you stopped at our house , ” pursued Miss Jellyby , “ I should have been ashamed to come here to-day , for I know what a figure I must seem to you two .
But as it is , I made up my mind to call , especially as I am not likely to see you again the next time you come to town . ” She said this with such great <unk> that Ada and I glanced at one another , <unk> something more .
“ No ! ” said Miss Jellyby , shaking her head .
“ Not at all likely !
I know I may trust you two .
I am sure you won ’ t <unk> me .
I am engaged . ” “ Without their knowledge at home ? ” said I.
“ Why , good gracious me , Miss Summerson , ” she returned , <unk> herself in a <unk> but not angry manner , “ how can it be otherwise ?
You know what Ma is — and I needn ’ t make poor Pa more miserable by telling HIM . ” “ But would it not be adding to his <unk> to marry without his knowledge or consent , my dear ? ” said I.
“ No , ” said Miss Jellyby , <unk> .
“ I hope not .
I should try to make him happy and comfortable when he came to see me , and Peepy and the others should take it in turns to come and stay with me , and they should have some care taken of them then . ” There was a good deal of affection in poor Caddy .
She softened more and more while saying this and cried so much over the <unk> little <unk> she had raised in her mind that Peepy , in his <unk> under the piano , was touched , and turned himself over on his back with loud <unk> .
It was not until I had brought him to kiss his sister , and had restored him to his place on my lap , and had shown him that Caddy was laughing ( she laughed expressly for the purpose ) , that we could recall his peace of mind ; even then it was for some time <unk> on his taking us in turns by the chin and smoothing our faces all over with his hand .
At last , as his spirits were not equal to the piano , we put him on a chair to look out of window ; and Miss Jellyby , holding him by one leg , resumed her confidence .
“ It began in your coming to our house , ” she said .
We naturally asked how .
“ I felt I was so awkward , ” she replied , “ that I made up my mind to be improved in that respect at all events and to learn to dance .
I told Ma I was ashamed of myself , and I must be taught to dance .
Ma looked at me in that <unk> way of hers as if I wasn ’ t in sight , but I was quite determined to be taught to dance , and so I went to Mr. Turveydrop ’ s <unk> in Newman Street . ” “ And was it there , my dear — ” I began .
“ Yes , it was there , ” said Caddy , “ and I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop .
There are two Mr. <unk> , father and son .
My Mr. Turveydrop is the son , of course .
I only wish I had been better brought up and was likely to make him a better wife , for I am very fond of him . ” “ I am sorry to hear this , ” said I , “ I must confess . ” “ I don ’ t know why you should be sorry , ” she retorted a little anxiously , “ but I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop , whether or no , and he is very fond of me .
It ’ s a secret as yet , even on his side , because old Mr. Turveydrop has a share in the connexion and it might break his heart or give him some other shock if he was told of it <unk> .
Old Mr. Turveydrop is a very gentlemanly man indeed — very gentlemanly . ” “ Does his wife know of it ? ” asked Ada .
“ Old Mr. Turveydrop ’ s wife , Miss Clare ? ” returned Miss Jellyby , opening her eyes .
“ There ’ s no such person .
He is a <unk> . ” We were here interrupted by Peepy , whose leg had <unk> so much on account of his sister ’ s unconsciously <unk> it like a <unk> whenever she was emphatic that the afflicted child now <unk> his <unk> with a very low-spirited noise .
As he <unk> to me for compassion , and as I was only a <unk> , I <unk> to hold him .
Miss Jellyby proceeded , after begging Peepy ’ s pardon with a kiss and <unk> him that she hadn ’ t meant to do it .
“ That ’ s the state of the case , ” said Caddy .
“ If I ever blame myself , I still think it ’ s Ma ’ s fault .
We are to be married whenever we can , and then I shall go to Pa at the office and write to Ma .
It won ’ t much <unk> Ma ; I am only pen and ink to HER .
One great comfort is , ” said Caddy with a sob , “ that I shall never hear of Africa after I am married .
Young Mr. Turveydrop <unk> it for my sake , and if old Mr. Turveydrop knows there is such a place , it ’ s as much as he does . ” “ It was he who was very gentlemanly , I think ! ” said I.
“ Very gentlemanly indeed , ” said Caddy .
“ He is celebrated almost everywhere for his deportment . ” “ Does he teach ? ” asked Ada .
“ No , he don ’ t teach anything in particular , ” replied Caddy .
“ But his deportment is beautiful . ” Caddy went on to say with considerable hesitation and <unk> that there was one thing more she wished us to know , and felt we ought to know , and which she hoped would not <unk> us .
It was that she had improved her acquaintance with Miss Flite , the little crazy old lady , and that she frequently went there early in the morning and met her lover for a few minutes before breakfast — only for a few minutes .
“ I go there at other times , ” said Caddy , “ but Prince does not come then .
Young Mr. Turveydrop ’ s name is Prince ; I wish it wasn ’ t , because it sounds like a dog , but of course he didn ’ t <unk> himself .
Old Mr. Turveydrop had him christened Prince in remembrance of the Prince Regent .
Old Mr. Turveydrop <unk> the Prince Regent on account of his deportment .
I hope you won ’ t think the worse of me for having made these little <unk> at Miss Flite ’ s , where I first went with you , because I like the poor thing for her own sake and I believe she likes me .
If you could see young Mr. Turveydrop , I am sure you would think well of him — at least , I am sure you couldn ’ t possibly think any ill of him .
I am going there now for my lesson .
I couldn ’ t ask you to go with me , Miss Summerson ; but if you would , ” said Caddy , who had said all this earnestly and <unk> , “ I should be very glad — very glad . ” It happened that we had arranged with my guardian to go to Miss Flite ’ s that day .
We had told him of our former visit , and our account had interested him ; but something had always happened to prevent our going there again .
As I trusted that I might have sufficient influence with Miss Jellyby to prevent her taking any very rash step if I fully accepted the confidence she was so willing to place in me , poor girl , I proposed that she and I and Peepy should go to the academy and afterwards meet my guardian and Ada at Miss Flite ’ s , whose name I now learnt for the first time .
This was on condition that Miss Jellyby and Peepy should come back with us to dinner .
The last article of the agreement being <unk> <unk> to by both , we <unk> Peepy up a little with the assistance of a few <unk> , some soap and water , and a <unk> , and went out , bending our steps towards Newman Street , which was very near .
I found the academy established in a sufficiently dingy house at the corner of an archway , with <unk> in all the staircase windows .
In the same house there were also established , as I gathered from the <unk> on the door , a <unk> , a <unk> ( there was , certainly , no room for his <unk> ) , and a <unk> artist .
On the plate which , in size and situation , took <unk> of all the rest , I read , <unk> <unk> .
The door was open , and the hall was <unk> up by a grand piano , a <unk> , and several other musical <unk> in cases , all in progress of removal , and all looking <unk> in the daylight .
Miss Jellyby informed me that the academy had been <unk> , last night , for a <unk> .
We went upstairs — it had been quite a fine house once , when it was anybody ’ s business to keep it clean and fresh , and nobody ’ s business to smoke in it all day — and into Mr. Turveydrop ’ s great room , which was built out into a <unk> at the back and was lighted by a skylight .
It was a bare , <unk> room <unk> of stables , with <unk> forms along the walls , and the walls <unk> at regular intervals with painted <unk> and little <unk> branches for candles , which seemed to be <unk> their old-fashioned drops as other branches might shed autumn leaves .
Several young lady pupils , <unk> from <unk> or <unk> years of age to two or three and twenty , were assembled ; and I was looking among them for their <unk> when Caddy , pinching my arm , repeated the ceremony of introduction .
“ Miss Summerson , Mr.
Prince Turveydrop ! ” I <unk> to a little blue-eyed fair man of youthful appearance with <unk> hair parted in the middle and <unk> at the ends all round his head .
He had a little <unk> , which we used to call at school a kit , under his left arm , and its little bow in the same hand .
His little <unk> were particularly <unk> , and he had a little innocent , <unk> manner which not only <unk> to me in an amiable way , but made this singular effect upon me , that I received the impression that he was like his mother and that his mother had not been much considered or well used .
“ I am very happy to see Miss Jellyby ’ s friend , ” he said , bowing low to me .
“ I began to fear , ” with timid tenderness , “ as it was past the usual time , that Miss Jellyby was not coming . ” “ I beg you will have the goodness to <unk> that to me , who have detained her , and to receive my <unk> , sir , ” said I.
“ Oh , dear ! ” said he .
“ And pray , ” I entreated , “ do not allow me to be the cause of any more delay . ” With that apology I withdrew to a seat between Peepy ( who , being well used to it , had already <unk> into a corner place ) and an old lady of a <unk> countenance whose two <unk> were in the class and who was very indignant with Peepy ’ s boots .
Prince Turveydrop then <unk> the strings of his kit with his fingers , and the young ladies stood up to dance .
Just then there appeared from a <unk> old Mr. Turveydrop , in the full <unk> of his deportment .
He was a fat old gentleman with a false complexion , false teeth , false whiskers , and a wig .
He had a fur collar , and he had a <unk> breast to his coat , which only wanted a star or a broad blue <unk> to be complete .
He was pinched in , and swelled out , and got up , and <unk> down , as much as he could possibly bear .
He had such a <unk> on ( <unk> his very eyes out of their natural shape ) , and his chin and even his ears so sunk into it , that it seemed as though he must <unk> double up if it were cast loose .
He had under his arm a hat of great size and weight , <unk> downward from the crown to the <unk> , and in his hand a pair of white gloves with which he <unk> it as he stood <unk> on one leg in a high-shouldered , <unk> state of <unk> not to be <unk> .
He had a <unk> , he had an eye-glass , he had a <unk> , he had rings , he had <unk> , he had everything but any touch of nature ; he was not like youth , he was not like age , he was not like anything in the world but a model of deportment .
“ Father !
A visitor .
Miss Jellyby ’ s friend , Miss Summerson . ” “ <unk> , ” said Mr. Turveydrop , “ by Miss Summerson ’ s presence . ” As he bowed to me in that tight state , I almost believe I saw <unk> come into the <unk> of his eyes .
“ My father , ” said the son , aside , to me with quite an affecting belief in him , “ is a celebrated character .
My father is greatly admired . ” “ Go on , Prince !
Go on ! ” said Mr. Turveydrop , standing with his back to the fire and waving his gloves <unk> .
“ Go on , my son ! ” At this command , or by this gracious permission , the lesson went on .
Prince Turveydrop sometimes played the kit , dancing ; sometimes played the piano , standing ; sometimes <unk> the tune with what little breath he could spare , while he set a pupil right ; always <unk> moved with the least <unk> through every step and every part of the figure ; and never rested for an instant .
His distinguished father did nothing whatever but stand before the fire , a model of deportment .
“ And he never does anything else , ” said the old lady of the <unk> countenance .
“ Yet would you believe that it ’ s HIS name on the <unk> ? ” “ His son ’ s name is the same , you know , ” said I.
“ He wouldn ’ t let his son have any name if he could take it from him , ” returned the old lady .
“ Look at the son ’ s dress ! ” It certainly was plain — threadbare — almost shabby .
“ Yet the father must be <unk> and <unk> out , ” said the old lady , “ because of his deportment .
I ’ d <unk> him !
<unk> him would be better ! ” I felt curious to know more concerning this person .
I asked , “ Does he give <unk> in deportment now ? ” “ Now ! ” returned the old lady shortly .
“ Never did . ” After a moment ’ s consideration , I suggested that perhaps <unk> had been his <unk> .
“ I don ’ t believe he can <unk> at all , ma ’ am , ” said the old lady .
I looked surprised and inquisitive .
The old lady , becoming more and more <unk> against the master of deportment as she dwelt upon the subject , gave me some particulars of his career , with strong assurances that they were mildly stated .
He had married a meek little <unk> , with a <unk> connexion ( having never in his life before done anything but <unk> himself ) , and had worked her to death , or had , at the best , suffered her to work herself to death , to maintain him in those expenses which were <unk> to his position .
At once to <unk> his deportment to the best <unk> and to keep the best <unk> constantly before himself , he had found it necessary to frequent all public places of fashionable and <unk> <unk> , to be seen at <unk> and elsewhere at fashionable times , and to lead an idle life in the very best clothes .
To <unk> him to do this , the affectionate little <unk> had <unk> and laboured and would have <unk> and laboured to that hour if her strength had lasted so long .
For the <unk> of the story was that in spite of the man ’ s <unk> <unk> , his wife ( overpowered by his deportment ) had , to the last , believed in him and had , on her <unk> , in the most moving terms , confided him to their son as one who had an <unk> claim upon him and whom he could never regard with too much pride and deference .
The son , <unk> his mother ’ s belief , and having the deportment always before him , had lived and grown in the same faith , and now , at thirty years of age , worked for his father twelve hours a day and looked up to him with <unk> on the old imaginary <unk> .
“ The <unk> the fellow gives himself ! ” said my <unk> , shaking her head at old Mr. Turveydrop with speechless indignation as he drew on his tight gloves , of course unconscious of the homage she was rendering .
“ He fully believes he is one of the <unk> !
And he is so condescending to the son he so <unk> <unk> that you might suppose him the most <unk> of parents .
Oh ! ” said the old lady , <unk> him with infinite vehemence .
“ I could bite you ! ” I could not help being amused , though I heard the old lady out with feelings of real concern .
It was difficult to doubt her with the father and son before me .
What I might have thought of them without the old lady ’ s account , or what I might have thought of the old lady ’ s account without them , I cannot say .
There was a <unk> of things in the whole that carried conviction with it .
My eyes were yet wandering , from young Mr. Turveydrop working so hard , to old Mr. Turveydrop <unk> himself so <unk> , when the latter came <unk> up to me and entered into conversation .
He asked me , first of all , whether I <unk> a charm and a distinction on London by residing in it ?
I did not think it necessary to reply that I was perfectly aware I should not do that , in any case , but merely told him where I did <unk> .
“ A lady so graceful and accomplished , ” he said , kissing his right glove and afterwards <unk> it towards the pupils , “ will look <unk> on the <unk> here .
We do our best to polish — polish — polish ! ” He sat down beside me , taking some pains to sit on the form , I thought , in imitation of the print of his illustrious model on the sofa .
And really he did look very like it .
“ To polish — polish — polish ! ” he repeated , taking a pinch of snuff and gently fluttering his fingers .
“ But we are not , if I may say so to one formed to be graceful both by Nature and <unk> — ” with the high-shouldered bow , which it seemed impossible for him to make without lifting up his eyebrows and shutting his eyes “ — we are not what we used to be in point of deportment . ” “ Are we not , sir ? ” said I.
“ We have <unk> , ” he returned , shaking his head , which he could do to a very limited extent in his cravat .
“ A <unk> age is not favourable to deportment .
It <unk> <unk> .
Perhaps I speak with some little <unk> .
It may not be for me to say that I have been called , for some years now , <unk> Turveydrop , or that his Royal Highness the Prince Regent did me the honour to inquire , on my removing my hat as he drove out of the <unk> at <unk> ( that fine building ) , ‘ Who is he ?
Who the devil is he ?
Why don ’ t I know him ?
Why hasn ’ t he thirty thousand a year ? ’ But these are little matters of <unk> — the general property , ma ’ am — still repeated occasionally among the upper classes . ” “ Indeed ? ” said I.
He replied with the high-shouldered bow .
“ Where what is left among us of deportment , ” he added , “ still <unk> .
England — <unk> , my country ! — has <unk> very much , and is <unk> every day .
She has not many gentlemen left .
We are few .
I see nothing to succeed us but a race of <unk> . ” “ One might hope that the race of gentlemen would be <unk> here , ” said I.
“ You are very good . ” He smiled with a high-shouldered bow again .
“ You <unk> me .
But , no — no !
I have never been able to <unk> my poor boy with that part of his art .
Heaven forbid that I should disparage my dear child , but he has — no deportment . ” “ He appears to be an excellent master , ” I observed .
“ <unk> me , my dear <unk> , he IS an excellent master .
All that can be acquired , he has acquired .
All that can be imparted , he can <unk> .
But there ARE things — ” He took another pinch of snuff and made the bow again , as if to add , “ This kind of thing , for instance . ” I glanced towards the centre of the room , where Miss Jellyby ’ s lover , now engaged with single pupils , was <unk> greater <unk> than ever .
“ My amiable child , ” murmured Mr. Turveydrop , adjusting his cravat .
“ Your son is <unk> , ” said I.
“ It is my reward , ” said Mr. Turveydrop , “ to hear you say so .
In some respects , he <unk> in the footsteps of his <unk> mother .
She was a devoted creature .
But <unk> , lovely <unk> , ” said Mr. Turveydrop with very disagreeable gallantry , “ what a sex you are ! ” I rose and joined Miss Jellyby , who was by this time putting on her bonnet .
The time <unk> to a lesson having fully <unk> , there was a general putting on of bonnets .
When Miss Jellyby and the unfortunate Prince found an opportunity to become <unk> I don ’ t know , but they certainly found none on this occasion to <unk> a dozen words .
“ My dear , ” said Mr. Turveydrop <unk> to his son , “ do you know the hour ? ” “ No , father . ” The son had no watch .
The father had a handsome gold one , which he pulled out with an air that was an example to mankind .
“ My son , ” said he , “ it ’ s two o ’ clock .
<unk> your school at <unk> at three . ” “ That ’ s time enough for me , father , ” said Prince .
“ I can take a morsel of dinner standing and be off . ” “ My dear boy , ” returned his father , “ you must be very quick .
You will find the cold mutton on the table . ” “ Thank you , father .
Are YOU off now , father ? ” “ Yes , my dear .
I suppose , ” said Mr. Turveydrop , shutting his eyes and lifting up his shoulders with modest consciousness , “ that I must show myself , as usual , about town . ” “ You had better dine out comfortably somewhere , ” said his son .
“ My dear child , I intend to .
I shall take my little meal , I think , at the French house , in the <unk> <unk> . ” “ That ’ s right .
Good-bye , father ! ” said Prince , shaking hands .
“ Good-bye , my son .
Bless you ! ” Mr. Turveydrop said this in quite a <unk> manner , and it seemed to do his son good , who , in parting from him , was so pleased with him , so dutiful to him , and so proud of him that I almost felt as if it were an <unk> to the younger man not to be able to believe <unk> in the elder .
The few moments that were occupied by Prince in taking leave of us ( and particularly of one of us , as I saw , being in the secret ) , <unk> my favourable impression of his almost childish character .
I felt a liking for him and a compassion for him as he put his little kit in his pocket — and with it his desire to stay a little while with Caddy — and went away good-humouredly to his cold mutton and his school at <unk> , that made me scarcely less <unk> with his father than the <unk> old lady .
The father opened the room door for us and bowed us out in a manner , I must acknowledge , worthy of his shining original .
In the same style he presently passed us on the other side of the street , on his way to the aristocratic part of the town , where he was going to show himself among the few other gentlemen left .
For some moments , I was so lost in <unk> what I had heard and seen in Newman Street that I was quite unable to talk to Caddy or even to <unk> my attention on what she said to me , especially when I began to inquire in my mind whether there were , or ever had been , any other gentlemen , not in the dancing profession , who lived and founded a reputation entirely on their deportment .
This became so <unk> and suggested the possibility of so many Mr. <unk> that I said , “ Esther , you must make up your mind to abandon this subject altogether and attend to Caddy . ” I accordingly did so , and we <unk> all the rest of the way to Lincoln ’ s Inn .
Caddy told me that her lover ’ s education had been so neglected that it was not always easy to read his notes .
She said if he were not so anxious about his <unk> and took less pains to make it clear , he would do better ; but he put so many unnecessary letters into short words that they sometimes quite lost their English appearance .
“ He does it with the best intention , ” observed Caddy , “ but it hasn ’ t the effect he means , poor fellow ! ” Caddy then went on to reason , how could he be expected to be a <unk> when he had passed his whole life in the <unk> and had done nothing but teach and <unk> , <unk> and teach , morning , noon , and night !
And what did it matter ?
She could write letters enough for both , as she knew to her cost , and it was far better for him to be amiable than learned .
“ Besides , it ’ s not as if I was an accomplished girl who had any right to give herself <unk> , ” said Caddy .
“ I know little enough , I am sure , thanks to Ma ! ” “ There ’ s another thing I want to tell you , now we are alone , ” continued Caddy , “ which I should not have liked to mention unless you had seen Prince , Miss Summerson .
You know what a house ours is .
It ’ s of no use my trying to learn anything that it would be useful for Prince ’ s wife to know in <unk> house .
We live in such a state of <unk> that it ’ s impossible , and I have only been more <unk> whenever I have tried .
So I get a little practice with — who do you think ?
Poor Miss Flite !
<unk> in the morning I help her to tidy her room and clean her birds , and I make her cup of coffee for her ( of course she taught me ) , and I have learnt to make it so well that Prince says it ’ s the very best coffee he ever <unk> , and would quite delight old Mr. Turveydrop , who is very particular indeed about his coffee .
I can make little <unk> too ; and I know how to buy neck of mutton , and tea , and <unk> , and butter , and a good many housekeeping things .
I am not clever at my needle , yet , ” said Caddy , glancing at the repairs on Peepy ’ s frock , “ but perhaps I shall improve , and since I have been engaged to Prince and have been doing all this , I have felt <unk> , I hope , and more <unk> to Ma .
It rather put me out at first this morning to see you and Miss Clare looking so neat and pretty and to feel ashamed of Peepy and myself too , but on the whole I hope I am <unk> than I was and more <unk> to Ma . ” The poor girl , trying so hard , said it from her heart , and touched mine .
“ Caddy , my love , ” I replied , “ I begin to have a great affection for you , and I hope we shall become friends . ” “ Oh , do you ? ” cried Caddy .
“ How happy that would make me ! ” “ My dear Caddy , ” said I , “ let us be friends from this time , and let us often have a <unk> about these matters and try to find the right way through them . ” Caddy was <unk> .
I said everything I could in my old-fashioned way to comfort and encourage her , and I would not have <unk> to old Mr. Turveydrop that day for any smaller consideration than a settlement on his <unk> .
By this time we were come to Mr. Krook ’ s , whose private door stood open .
There was a bill , <unk> on the <unk> , announcing a room to let on the second floor .
It reminded Caddy to tell me as we proceeded upstairs that there had been a sudden death there and an inquest and that our little friend had been ill of the fright .
The door and window of the vacant room being open , we looked in .
It was the room with the dark door to which Miss Flite had secretly directed my attention when I was last in the house .
A sad and desolate place it was , a gloomy , sorrowful place that gave me a strange sensation of <unk> and even dread .
“ You look pale , ” said Caddy when we came out , “ and cold ! ” I felt as if the room had chilled me .
We had walked slowly while we were talking , and my guardian and Ada were here before us .
We found them in Miss Flite ’ s <unk> .
They were looking at the birds , while a medical gentleman who was so good as to attend Miss Flite with much <unk> and compassion spoke with her cheerfully by the fire .
“ I have finished my professional visit , ” he said , coming forward .
“ Miss Flite is much better and may appear in court ( as her mind is set upon it ) to-morrow .
She has been greatly missed there , I understand . ” Miss Flite received the compliment with <unk> and dropped a general curtsy to us .
“ <unk> , indeed , ” said she , “ by another visit from the wards in Jarndyce !
Ve-ry happy to receive Jarndyce of Bleak House beneath my humble roof ! ” with a special curtsy .
“ <unk> , my dear ” — she had bestowed that name on Caddy , it appeared , and always called her by it — “ a double welcome ! ” “ Has she been very ill ? ” asked Mr. Jarndyce of the gentleman whom we had found in attendance on her .
She answered for herself directly , though he had put the question in a whisper .
“ Oh , decidedly <unk> !
Oh , very <unk> indeed , ” she said confidentially .
“ Not pain , you know — trouble .
Not bodily so much as nervous , nervous !
The truth is , ” in a subdued voice and trembling , “ we have had death here .
There was <unk> in the house .
I am very susceptible to such <unk> things .
It frightened me .
Only Mr. Woodcourt knows how much .
My physician , Mr. Woodcourt ! ” with great <unk> .
“ The wards in Jarndyce — Jarndyce of Bleak House — <unk> ! ” “ Miss Flite , ” said Mr. Woodcourt in a grave kind of voice , as if he were <unk> to her while speaking to us , and laying his hand gently on her arm , “ Miss Flite <unk> her illness with her usual <unk> .
She was alarmed by an occurrence in the house which might have alarmed a stronger person , and was made ill by the distress and agitation .
She brought me here in the first hurry of the discovery , though too late for me to be of any use to the unfortunate man .
I have <unk> myself for that disappointment by coming here since and being of some small use to her . ” “ The <unk> physician in the <unk> , ” whispered Miss Flite to me .
“ I expect a judgment .
On the day of judgment .
And shall then confer <unk> . ” “ She will be as well in a day or two , ” said Mr. Woodcourt , looking at her with an observant smile , “ as she ever will be .
In other words , quite well of course .
Have you heard of her good fortune ? ” “ Most extraordinary ! ” said Miss Flite , smiling brightly .
“ You never heard of such a thing , my dear !
Every Saturday , Conversation Kenge or Guppy ( clerk to Conversation <unk> ) places in my hand a paper of shillings .
<unk> .
I assure you !
Always the same number in the paper .
Always one for every day in the week .
Now you know , really !
So <unk> , is it not ?
Ye-es !
From whence do these papers come , you say ?
That is the great question .
<unk> .
Shall I tell you what I think ?
I think , ” said Miss Flite , drawing herself back with a very shrewd look and shaking her right forefinger in a most <unk> manner , “ that the Lord Chancellor , aware of the length of time during which the Great Seal has been open ( for it has been open a long time !
) , <unk> them .
<unk> the judgment I expect is given .
Now that ’ s very <unk> , you know .
To confess in that way that he IS a little slow for human life .
So delicate !
<unk> court the other day — I attend it regularly , with my documents — I <unk> him with it , and he almost confessed .
That is , I smiled at him from my bench , and HE smiled at me from his bench .
But it ’ s great good fortune , is it not ?
And <unk> lays the money out for me to great advantage .
Oh , I assure you to the greatest advantage ! ” I <unk> her ( as she addressed herself to me ) upon this fortunate addition to her income and wished her a long <unk> of it .
I did not <unk> upon the source from which it came or wonder whose humanity was so considerate .
My guardian stood before me , contemplating the birds , and I had no need to look beyond him .
“ And what do you call these little <unk> , ma ’ am ? ” said he in his pleasant voice .
“ Have they any names ? ” “ I can answer for Miss Flite that they have , ” said I , “ for she promised to tell us what they were .
Ada remembers ? ” Ada remembered very well .
“ Did I ? ” said Miss Flite .
“ Who ’ s that at my door ?
What are you listening at my door for , Krook ? ” The old man of the house , pushing it open before him , appeared there with his fur cap in his hand and his cat at his heels .
“ I warn ’ t listening , Miss Flite , ” he said , “ I was going to give a <unk> with my knuckles , only you ’ re so quick ! ” “ Make your cat go down .
<unk> her away ! ” the old lady angrily exclaimed .
“ <unk> , <unk> !
There ain ’ t no danger , <unk> , ” said Mr. Krook , looking slowly and sharply from one to another until he had looked at all of us ; “ she ’ d never offer at the birds when I was here unless I told her to it . ” “ You will excuse my landlord , ” said the old lady with a dignified air .
“ M , quite M !
What do you want , Krook , when I have company ? ” “ Hi ! ” said the old man .
“ You know I am the Chancellor . ” “ Well ? ” returned Miss Flite .
“ What of that ? ” “ For the Chancellor , ” said the old man with a <unk> , “ not to be acquainted with a Jarndyce is queer , ain ’ t it , Miss Flite ?
<unk> ’ t I take the liberty ?
Your servant , sir .
I know Jarndyce and Jarndyce a ’ most as well as you do , sir .
I <unk> old <unk> Tom , sir .
I never to my knowledge see you afore though , not even in court .
Yet , I go there a mortal sight of times in the course of the year , taking one day with another . ” “ I never go there , ” said Mr. Jarndyce ( which he never did on any consideration ) .
“ I would sooner go — somewhere else . ” “ Would you though ? ” returned Krook , <unk> .
“ You ’ re bearing hard upon my noble and learned brother in your meaning , sir , though perhaps it is but nat ’ <unk> in a Jarndyce .
The burnt child , sir !
What , you ’ re looking at my lodger ’ s birds , Mr. Jarndyce ? ” The old man had come by little and little into the room until he now touched my guardian with his elbow and looked close up into his face with his <unk> eyes .
“ It ’ s one of her strange ways that she ’ ll never tell the names of these birds if she can help it , though she named ’ em all . ” This was in a whisper .
“ Shall I run ’ em over , Flite ? ” he asked aloud , winking at us and pointing at her as she turned away , affecting to sweep the grate .
“ If you like , ” she answered hurriedly .
The old man , looking up at the <unk> after another look at us , went through the list .
“ <unk> , Joy , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Death , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
That ’ s the whole collection , ” said the old man , “ all <unk> up together , by my noble and learned brother . ” “ This is a bitter wind ! ” <unk> my guardian .
“ When my noble and learned brother gives his judgment , they ’ re to be let go free , ” said Krook , winking at us again .
“ And then , ” he added , whispering and <unk> , “ if that ever was to happen — which it won ’ t — the birds that have never been <unk> would <unk> ’ em . ” “ If ever the wind was in the east , ” said my guardian , pretending to look out of the window for a <unk> , “ I think it ’ s there to-day ! ” We found it very difficult to get away from the house .
It was not Miss Flite who detained us ; she was as reasonable a little creature in consulting the <unk> of others as there possibly could be .
It was Mr. Krook .
He seemed unable to <unk> himself from Mr. Jarndyce .
If he had been <unk> to him , he could hardly have attended him more closely .
He proposed to show us his Court of Chancery and all the strange <unk> it contained ; during the whole of our <unk> ( <unk> by himself ) he kept close to Mr. Jarndyce and sometimes detained him under one pretence or other until we had passed on , as if he were <unk> by an inclination to enter upon some secret subject which he could not make up his mind to approach .
I cannot imagine a countenance and manner more <unk> expressive of caution and indecision , and a <unk> impulse to do something he could not resolve to venture on , than Mr. Krook ’ s was that day .
His <unk> of my guardian was <unk> .
He rarely removed his eyes from his face .
If he went on beside him , he observed him with the <unk> of an old white <unk> .
If he went before , he looked back .
When we stood still , he got opposite to him , and drawing his hand across and across his open mouth with a curious expression of a sense of power , and turning up his eyes , and lowering his grey eyebrows until they appeared to be shut , seemed to <unk> every <unk> of his face .
At last , having been ( always attended by the cat ) all over the house and having seen the whole stock of <unk> <unk> , which was certainly curious , we came into the back part of the shop .
Here on the head of an empty <unk> stood on end were an <unk> , some old <unk> of pens , and some dirty <unk> ; and against the wall were <unk> several large printed <unk> in several plain hands .
“ What are you doing here ? ” asked my guardian .
“ <unk> to learn myself to read and write , ” said Krook .
“ And how do you get on ? ” “ <unk> .
<unk> , ” returned the old man <unk> .
“ It ’ s hard at my time of life . ” “ It would be easier to be taught by some one , ” said my guardian .
“ Aye , but they might teach me wrong ! ” returned the old man with a wonderfully suspicious <unk> of his eye .
“ I don ’ t know what I may have lost by not being learned afore .
I wouldn ’ t like to lose anything by being learned wrong now . ” “ <unk> ? ” said my guardian with his good-humoured smile .
“ Who do you suppose would teach you wrong ? ” “ I don ’ t know , Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House ! ” replied the old man , turning up his spectacles on his forehead and rubbing his hands .
“ I don ’ t suppose as anybody would , but I ’ d rather trust my own self than another ! ” These answers and his manner were strange enough to cause my guardian to inquire of Mr. Woodcourt , as we all walked across Lincoln ’ s Inn together , whether Mr. Krook were really , as his lodger represented him , <unk> .
The young surgeon replied , no , he had seen no reason to think so .
He was exceedingly distrustful , as ignorance usually was , and he was always more or less under the influence of raw <unk> , of which he <unk> great <unk> and of which he and his <unk> , as we might have observed , <unk> strongly ; but he did not think him mad as yet .
On our way home , I so <unk> Peepy ’ s <unk> by buying him a <unk> and two <unk> that he would suffer nobody else to take off his hat and gloves and would sit nowhere at dinner but at my side .
Caddy sat upon the other side of me , next to Ada , to whom we imparted the whole history of the engagement as soon as we got back .
We made much of Caddy , and Peepy too ; and Caddy brightened exceedingly ; and my guardian was as merry as we were ; and we were all very happy indeed until Caddy went home at night in a <unk> , with Peepy fast asleep , but holding tight to the <unk> .
I have forgotten to mention — at least I have not mentioned — that Mr. Woodcourt was the same dark young surgeon whom we had met at Mr. Badger ’ s .
Or that Mr. Jarndyce invited him to dinner that day .
Or that he came .
Or that when they were all gone and I said to Ada , “ Now , my darling , let us have a little talk about Richard ! ” Ada laughed and said — But I don ’ t think it matters what my darling said .
She was always merry .
CHAPTER <unk> Bell Yard While we were in London Mr. Jarndyce was constantly <unk> by the crowd of <unk> ladies and gentlemen whose proceedings had so much astonished us .
Mr. Quale , who presented himself soon after our arrival , was in all such <unk> .
He seemed to project those two shining knobs of temples of his into everything that went on and to brush his hair farther and farther back , until the very <unk> were almost ready to fly out of his head in <unk> <unk> .
All objects were alike to him , but he was always particularly ready for anything in the way of a <unk> to any one .
His great power seemed to be his power of <unk> admiration .
He would sit for any length of time , with the utmost enjoyment , <unk> his temples in the light of any order of <unk> .
Having first seen him perfectly swallowed up in admiration of Mrs. Jellyby , I had supposed her to be the <unk> object of his devotion .
I soon discovered my mistake and found him to be <unk> and <unk> to a whole procession of people .
Mrs. Pardiggle came one day for a <unk> to something , and with her , Mr. Quale .
Whatever Mrs. Pardiggle said , Mr. Quale repeated to us ; and just as he had drawn Mrs. Jellyby out , he drew Mrs. Pardiggle out .
Mrs. Pardiggle wrote a letter of introduction to my guardian in behalf of her eloquent friend Mr. Gusher .
With Mr. Gusher appeared Mr. Quale again .
Mr. Gusher , being a <unk> gentleman with a <unk> surface and eyes so much too small for his moon of a face that they seemed to have been originally made for somebody else , was not at first sight prepossessing ; yet he was scarcely seated before Mr. Quale asked Ada and me , not <unk> , whether he was not a great creature — which he certainly was , <unk> speaking , though Mr. Quale meant in intellectual beauty — and whether we were not struck by his massive <unk> of brow .
In short , we heard of a great many <unk> of various sorts among this set of people , but nothing respecting them was half so clear to us as that it was Mr. Quale ’ s mission to be in <unk> with everybody else ’ s mission and that it was the most popular mission of all .
Mr. Jarndyce had fallen into this company in the tenderness of his heart and his earnest desire to do all the good in his power ; but that he felt it to be too often an <unk> company , where benevolence took <unk> forms , where charity was assumed as a regular uniform by loud <unk> and <unk> in cheap <unk> , vehement in profession , restless and vain in action , <unk> in the last degree of meanness to the great , <unk> of one another , and intolerable to those who were anxious quietly to help the weak from <unk> rather than with a great deal of <unk> and <unk> to raise them up a little way when they were down , he plainly told us .
When a <unk> was originated to Mr. Quale by Mr. Gusher ( who had already got one , originated by Mr. Quale ) , and when Mr. Gusher spoke for an hour and a half on the subject to a meeting , including two charity <unk> of small boys and girls , who were <unk> reminded of the widow ’ s mite , and requested to come forward with halfpence and be <unk> <unk> , I think the wind was in the east for three whole weeks .
I mention this because I am coming to Mr. Skimpole again .
It seemed to me that his off-hand <unk> of <unk> and <unk> were a great relief to my guardian , by contrast with such things , and were the more readily believed in since to find one perfectly <unk> and candid man among many <unk> could not fail to give him pleasure .
I should be sorry to <unk> that Mr. Skimpole <unk> this and was <unk> ; I really never understood him well enough to know .
What he was to my guardian , he certainly was to the rest of the world .
He had not been very well ; and thus , though he lived in London , we had seen nothing of him until now .
He appeared one morning in his usual agreeable way and as full of pleasant spirits as ever .
Well , he said , here he was !
He had been <unk> , but rich men were often <unk> , and therefore he had been <unk> himself that he was a man of property .
So he was , in a certain point of view — in his <unk> intentions .
He had been <unk> his medical attendant in the most <unk> manner .
He had always <unk> , and sometimes <unk> , his fees .
He had said to the doctor , “ Now , my dear doctor , it is quite a <unk> on your part to suppose that you attend me for nothing .
I am <unk> you with money — in my <unk> intentions — if you only knew it ! ” And really ( he said ) he meant it to that degree that he thought it much the same as doing it .
If he had had those bits of metal or thin paper to which mankind attached so much importance to put in the doctor ’ s hand , he would have put them in the doctor ’ s hand .
Not having them , he <unk> the will for the deed .
Very well !
If he really meant it — if his will were genuine and real , which it was — it appeared to him that it was the same as <unk> , and <unk> the obligation .
“ It may be , partly , because I know nothing of the value of money , ” said Mr. Skimpole , “ but I often feel this .
It seems so reasonable !
My butcher says to me he wants that little bill .
It ’ s a part of the pleasant unconscious poetry of the man ’ s nature that he always calls it a ‘ little ’ bill — to make the <unk> appear easy to both of us .
I reply to the butcher , ‘ My good friend , if you knew it , you are paid .
You haven ’ t had the trouble of coming to ask for the little bill .
You are paid .
I mean it . ’ ” “ But , suppose , ” said my guardian , laughing , “ he had meant the <unk> in the bill , instead of providing it ? ” “ My dear Jarndyce , ” he returned , “ you surprise me .
You take the butcher ’ s position .
A butcher I once <unk> with occupied that very ground .
Says he , ‘ Sir , why did you eat spring lamb at eighteen <unk> a pound ? ’ ‘ Why did I eat spring lamb at eighteen <unk> a pound , my honest friend ? ’ said I , naturally amazed by the question .
‘ I like spring lamb ! ’ This was so far <unk> .
‘ Well , sir , ’ says he , ‘ I wish I had meant the lamb as you mean the money ! ’ ‘ My good fellow , ’ said I , ‘ pray let us reason like intellectual <unk> .
How could that be ?
It was impossible .
You HAD got the lamb , and I have NOT got the money .
You couldn ’ t really mean the lamb without sending it in , <unk> I can , and do , really mean the money without paying it ! ’ He had not a word .
There was an end of the subject . ” “ Did he take no legal proceedings ? ” inquired my guardian .
“ Yes , he took legal proceedings , ” said Mr. Skimpole .
“ But in that he was <unk> by passion , not by reason .
<unk> <unk> me of Boythorn .
He writes me that you and the ladies have promised him a short visit at his <unk> in Lincolnshire . ” “ He is a great favourite with my girls , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , “ and I have promised for them . ” “ Nature forgot to shade him off , I think , ” observed Mr. Skimpole to Ada and me .
“ A little too <unk> — like the sea .
A little too vehement — like a bull who has made up his mind to consider every colour <unk> .
But I <unk> a <unk> sort of merit in him ! ” I should have been surprised if those two could have thought very highly of one another , Mr. Boythorn <unk> so much importance to many things and Mr. Skimpole <unk> so little for anything .
Besides which , I had noticed Mr. Boythorn more than once on the point of breaking out into some strong opinion when Mr. Skimpole was referred to .
Of course I merely joined Ada in saying that we had been greatly pleased with him .
“ He has invited me , ” said Mr. Skimpole ; “ and if a child may trust himself in such hands — which the present child is encouraged to do , with the united tenderness of two angels to guard him — I shall go .
He proposes to frank me down and back again .
I suppose it will cost money ?
<unk> perhaps ?
Or pounds ?
Or something of that sort ?
By the by , Coavinses .
You remember our friend Coavinses , Miss Summerson ? ” He asked me as the subject arose in his mind , in his graceful , light-hearted manner and without the least embarrassment .
“ Oh , yes ! ” said I.
“ Coavinses has been arrested by the Great <unk> , ” said Mr. Skimpole .
“ He will never do violence to the sunshine any more . ” It quite shocked me to hear it , for I had already recalled with anything but a serious association the image of the man sitting on the sofa that night wiping his head .
“ His <unk> informed me of it yesterday , ” said Mr. Skimpole .
“ His <unk> is in my house now — in possession , I think he calls it .
He came yesterday , on my blue-eyed daughter ’ s birthday .
I put it to him , ‘ This is unreasonable and inconvenient .
If you had a blue-eyed daughter you wouldn ’ t like ME to come , <unk> , on HER birthday ? ’ But he stayed . ” Mr. Skimpole laughed at the pleasant <unk> and lightly touched the piano by which he was seated .
“ And he told me , ” he said , playing little chords where I shall put full stops , “ The Coavinses had left .
Three children .
No mother .
And that Coavinses ’ profession .
Being <unk> .
The rising Coavinses .
<unk> at a considerable disadvantage . ” Mr. Jarndyce got up , rubbing his head , and began to walk about .
Mr. Skimpole played the <unk> of one of Ada ’ s favourite songs .
Ada and I both looked at Mr. Jarndyce , thinking that we knew what was passing in his mind .
After walking and stopping , and several times leaving off rubbing his head , and beginning again , my guardian put his hand upon the keys and stopped Mr. Skimpole ’ s playing .
“ I don ’ t like this , Skimpole , ” he said thoughtfully .
Mr. Skimpole , who had quite forgotten the subject , looked up surprised .
“ The man was necessary , ” pursued my guardian , walking backward and forward in the very short space between the piano and the end of the room and rubbing his hair up from the back of his head as if a high east wind had blown it into that form .
“ If we make such men necessary by our faults and <unk> , or by our want of worldly knowledge , or by our <unk> , we must not <unk> ourselves upon them .
There was no harm in his trade .
He maintained his children .
One would like to know more about this . ” “ Oh !
Coavinses ? ” cried Mr. Skimpole , at length <unk> what he meant .
“ Nothing easier .
A walk to Coavinses ’ <unk> , and you can know what you will . ” Mr. Jarndyce nodded to us , who were only waiting for the signal .
“ Come !
We will walk that way , my dears .
Why not that way as soon as another ! ” We were quickly ready and went out .
Mr. Skimpole went with us and quite enjoyed the expedition .
It was so new and so <unk> , he said , for him to want Coavinses instead of Coavinses wanting him !
He took us , first , to Cursitor Street , Chancery Lane , where there was a house with <unk> windows , which he called Coavinses ’ <unk> .
On our going into the entry and ringing a bell , a very hideous boy came out of a sort of office and looked at us over a <unk> <unk> .
“ Who did you want ? ” said the boy , <unk> two of the <unk> into his chin .
“ There was a <unk> , or an officer , or something , here , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , “ who is dead . ” “ Yes ? ” said the boy .
“ Well ? ” “ I want to know his name , if you please ? ” “ Name of <unk> , ” said the boy .
“ And his address ? ” “ Bell Yard , ” said the boy .
“ <unk> ’ s shop , left hand side , name of Blinder . ” “ Was he — I don ’ t know how to shape the question — ” murmured my guardian , “ industrious ? ” “ Was <unk> ? ” said the boy .
“ Yes , wery much so .
He was never tired of watching .
He ’ d set upon a post at a street corner eight or ten hours at a stretch if he <unk> to do it . ” “ He might have done worse , ” I heard my guardian <unk> .
“ He might have <unk> to do it and not done it .
Thank you .
That ’ s all I want . ” We left the boy , with his head on one side and his arms on the gate , <unk> and <unk> the <unk> , and went back to Lincoln ’ s Inn , where Mr. Skimpole , who had not cared to remain nearer Coavinses , <unk> us .
Then we all went to Bell Yard , a narrow <unk> at a very short distance .
We soon found the <unk> ’ s shop .
In it was a <unk> old woman with a <unk> , or an <unk> , or perhaps both .
“ <unk> ’ s children ? ” said she in reply to my inquiry .
“ Yes , Surely , miss .
Three pair , if you please .
<unk> right opposite the stairs . ” And she handed me the key across the counter .
I glanced at the key and glanced at her , but she took it for granted that I knew what to do with it .
As it could only be intended for the children ’ s door , I came out without asking any more questions and led the way up the dark stairs .
We went as quietly as we could , but four of us made some noise on the aged <unk> , and when we came to the second story we found we had disturbed a man who was standing there looking out of his room .
“ Is it Gridley that ’ s wanted ? ” he said , fixing his eyes on me with an angry stare .
“ No , sir , ” said I ; “ I am going higher up . ” He looked at Ada , and at Mr. Jarndyce , and at Mr. Skimpole , fixing the same angry stare on each in succession as they passed and followed me .
Mr. Jarndyce gave him good day .
“ Good day ! ” he said <unk> and <unk> .
He was a tall , sallow man with a <unk> head on which but little hair remained , a deeply <unk> face , and prominent eyes .
He had a <unk> look and a <unk> , <unk> manner which , associated with his figure — still large and powerful , though evidently in its decline — rather alarmed me .
He had a pen in his hand , and in the glimpse I caught of his room in passing , I saw that it was covered with a litter of papers .
Leaving him standing there , we went up to the top room .
I tapped at the door , and a little shrill voice inside said , “ We are locked in .
Mrs. Blinder ’ s got the key ! ” I applied the key on hearing this and opened the door .
In a poor room with a <unk> ceiling and containing very little furniture was a mite of a boy , some five or six years old , nursing and <unk> a heavy child of eighteen months .
There was no fire , though the weather was cold ; both children were wrapped in some poor <unk> and <unk> as a <unk> .
Their <unk> was not so warm , however , but that their <unk> looked red and pinched and their small figures <unk> as the boy walked up and down nursing and <unk> the child with its head on his shoulder .
“ Who has locked you up here alone ? ” we naturally asked .
“ Charley , ” said the boy , standing still to gaze at us .
“ Is Charley your brother ? ” “ No .
She ’ s my sister , <unk> .
Father called her Charley . ” “ Are there any more of you besides Charley ? ” “ Me , ” said the boy , “ and Emma , ” <unk> the limp bonnet of the child he was nursing .
“ And Charley . ” “ Where is Charley now ? ” “ Out <unk> , ” said the boy , beginning to walk up and down again and taking the <unk> bonnet much too near the bedstead by trying to gaze at us at the same time .
We were looking at one another and at these two children when there came into the room a very little girl , childish in figure but shrewd and <unk> in the face — <unk> too — wearing a womanly sort of bonnet much too large for her and drying her bare arms on a womanly sort of apron .
Her fingers were white and <unk> with washing , and the <unk> were yet smoking which she <unk> off her arms .
But for this , she might have been a child playing at washing and <unk> a poor <unk> with a quick observation of the truth .
She had come running from some place in the neighbourhood and had made all the haste she could .
Consequently , though she was very light , she was out of breath and could not speak at first , as she stood panting , and wiping her arms , and looking quietly at us .
“ Oh , here ’ s Charley ! ” said the boy .
The child he was nursing stretched forth its arms and cried out to be taken by Charley .
The little girl took it , in a womanly sort of manner belonging to the apron and the bonnet , and stood looking at us over the burden that clung to her most affectionately .
“ Is it possible , ” whispered my guardian as we put a chair for the little creature and got her to sit down with her load , the boy keeping close to her , holding to her apron , “ that this child works for the rest ?
Look at this !
For God ’ s sake , look at this ! ” It was a thing to look at .
The three children close together , and two of them <unk> <unk> on the third , and the third so young and yet with an air of age and <unk> that sat so strangely on the childish figure .
“ Charley , Charley ! ” said my guardian .
“ How old are you ? ” “ Over <unk> , sir , ” replied the child .
“ Oh !
What a great age , ” said my guardian .
“ What a great age , Charley ! ” I cannot describe the tenderness with which he spoke to her , half <unk> yet all the more <unk> and <unk> .
“ And do you live alone here with these <unk> , Charley ? ” said my guardian .
“ Yes , sir , ” returned the child , looking up into his face with perfect confidence , “ since father died . ” “ And how do you live , Charley ?
Oh !
Charley , ” said my guardian , turning his face away for a moment , “ how do you live ? ” “ Since father died , sir , I ’ ve gone out to work .
I ’ m out washing to-day . ” “ God help you , Charley ! ” said my guardian .
“ You ’ re not tall enough to reach the tub ! ” “ In pattens I am , sir , ” she said quickly .
“ I ’ ve got a high pair as <unk> to mother . ” “ And when did mother die ?
Poor mother ! ” “ Mother died just after Emma was born , ” said the child , glancing at the face upon her bosom .
“ Then father said I was to be as good a mother to her as I could .
And so I tried .
And so I worked at home and did <unk> and nursing and washing for a long time before I began to go out .
And that ’ s how I know how ; don ’ t you see , sir ? ” “ And do you often go out ? ” “ As often as I can , ” said Charley , opening her eyes and smiling , “ because of <unk> <unk> and shillings ! ” “ And do you always lock the <unk> up when you go out ? ” “ To keep ’ em safe , sir , don ’ t you see ? ” said Charley .
“ Mrs.
Blinder comes up now and then , and Mr. Gridley comes up sometimes , and perhaps I can run in sometimes , and they can play you know , and Tom an ’ t afraid of being locked up , are you , Tom ? ” “ <unk> ! ” said Tom <unk> .
“ When it comes on dark , the lamps are lighted down in the court , and they show up here quite bright — almost quite bright .
Don ’ t they , Tom ? ” “ Yes , Charley , ” said Tom , “ almost quite bright . ” “ Then he ’ s as good as gold , ” said the little creature — Oh , in such a motherly , womanly way !
“ And when Emma ’ s tired , he puts her to bed .
And when he ’ s tired he goes to bed himself .
And when I come home and light the candle and has a bit of supper , he sits up again and has it with me .
Don ’ t you , Tom ? ” “ Oh , yes , Charley ! ” said Tom .
“ That I do ! ” And either in this glimpse of the great pleasure of his life or in gratitude and love for Charley , who was all in all to him , he laid his face among the <unk> folds of her frock and passed from laughing into crying .
It was the first time since our entry that a tear had been shed among these children .
The little orphan girl had spoken of their father and their mother as if all that sorrow were subdued by the necessity of taking courage , and by her childish importance in being able to work , and by her <unk> busy way .
But now , when Tom cried , although she sat quite tranquil , looking quietly at us , and did not by any movement disturb a hair of the head of either of her little charges , I saw two silent tears fall down her face .
I stood at the window with Ada , pretending to look at the <unk> , and the blackened <unk> of chimneys , and the poor plants , and the birds in little <unk> belonging to the neighbours , when I found that Mrs. Blinder , from the shop below , had come in ( perhaps it had taken her all this time to get upstairs ) and was talking to my guardian .
“ It ’ s not much to forgive ’ em the rent , sir , ” she said ; “ who could take it from them ! ” “ Well , well ! ” said my guardian to us two .
“ It is enough that the time will come when this good woman will find that it WAS much , and that <unk> as she did it unto the least of these — This child , ” he added after a few moments , “ could she possibly continue this ? ” “ Really , sir , I think she might , ” said Mrs. Blinder , getting her heavy breath by painful degrees .
“ She ’ s as <unk> as it ’ s possible to be .
Bless you , sir , the way she <unk> them two children after the mother died was the talk of the yard !
And it was a wonder to see her with him after he was took ill , it really was !
‘ Mrs.
Blinder , ’ he said to me the very last he spoke — he was lying there — ‘ Mrs.
Blinder , whatever my calling may have been , I see a angel sitting in this room last night along with my child , and I trust her to Our Father ! ’ ” “ He had no other calling ? ” said my guardian .
“ No , sir , ” returned Mrs. Blinder , “ he was nothing but a <unk> .
When he first came to lodge here , I didn ’ t know what he was , and I confess that when I found out I gave him notice .
It wasn ’ t liked in the yard .
It wasn ’ t <unk> by the other <unk> .
It is NOT a genteel calling , ” said Mrs. Blinder , “ and most people do object to it .
Mr. Gridley <unk> to it very strong , and he is a good lodger , though his temper has been hard tried . ” “ So you gave him notice ? ” said my guardian .
“ So I gave him notice , ” said Mrs. Blinder .
“ But really when the time came , and I knew no other ill of him , I was in doubts .
He was punctual and diligent ; he did what he had to do , sir , ” said Mrs. Blinder , unconsciously fixing Mr. Skimpole with her eye , “ and it ’ s something in this world even to do that . ” “ So you kept him after all ? ” “ Why , I said that if he could arrange with Mr. Gridley , I could arrange it with the other <unk> and should not so much mind its being liked or <unk> in the yard .
Mr. Gridley gave his consent <unk> — but gave it .
He was always <unk> with him , but he has been kind to the children since .
A person is never known till a person is proved . ” “ Have many people been kind to the children ? ” asked Mr. Jarndyce .
“ Upon the whole , not so bad , sir , ” said Mrs. Blinder ; “ but certainly not so many as would have been if their father ’ s calling had been different .
Mr. <unk> gave a <unk> , and the <unk> made up a little purse .
Some neighbours in the yard that had always <unk> and tapped their shoulders when he went by came forward with a little <unk> , and — in general — not so bad .
<unk> with <unk> .
Some people won ’ t employ her because she was a <unk> ’ s child ; some people that do employ her cast it at her ; some make a merit of having her to work for them , with that and all her <unk> upon her , and perhaps pay her less and put upon her more .
But she ’ s <unk> than others would be , and is clever too , and always willing , up to the full mark of her strength and over .
So I should say , in general , not so bad , sir , but might be better . ” Mrs. Blinder sat down to give herself a more favourable opportunity of recovering her breath , exhausted anew by so much talking before it was fully restored .
Mr. Jarndyce was turning to speak to us when his attention was attracted by the <unk> entrance into the room of the Mr. Gridley who had been mentioned and whom we had seen on our way up .
“ I don ’ t know what you may be doing here , ladies and gentlemen , ” he said , as if he <unk> our presence , “ but you ’ ll excuse my coming in .
I don ’ t come in to stare about me .
Well , Charley !
Well , Tom !
Well , little one !
How is it with us all to-day ? ” He bent over the <unk> in a <unk> way and clearly was regarded as a friend by the children , though his face <unk> its stern character and his manner to us was as <unk> as it could be .
My guardian noticed it and respected it .
“ No one , surely , would come here to stare about him , ” he said mildly .
“ May be so , sir , may be so , ” returned the other , taking Tom upon his knee and waving him off <unk> .
“ I don ’ t want to <unk> with ladies and gentlemen .
I have had enough of arguing to last one man his life . ” “ You have sufficient reason , I dare say , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , “ for being <unk> and <unk> — ” “ There again ! ” exclaimed the man , becoming violently angry .
“ I am of a <unk> temper .
I am <unk> .
I am not polite ! ” “ Not very , I think . ” “ Sir , ” said Gridley , putting down the child and going up to him as if he meant to strike him , “ do you know anything of <unk> of Equity ? ” “ Perhaps I do , to my sorrow . ” “ To your sorrow ? ” said the man , pausing in his <unk> , “ if so , I beg your pardon .
I am not polite , I know .
I beg your pardon !
Sir , ” with renewed violence , “ I have been dragged for five and twenty years over burning iron , and I have lost the habit of <unk> upon velvet .
Go into the Court of Chancery yonder and ask what is one of the standing <unk> that brighten up their business sometimes , and they will tell you that the best joke they have is the man from Shropshire .
I , ” he said , beating one hand on the other <unk> , “ am the man from Shropshire . ” “ I believe I and my family have also had the honour of <unk> some entertainment in the same grave place , ” said my guardian composedly .
“ You may have heard my name — Jarndyce . ” “ Mr.
Jarndyce , ” said Gridley with a rough sort of <unk> , “ you bear your wrongs more quietly than I can bear mine .
More than that , I tell you — and I tell this gentleman , and these young ladies , if they are friends of yours — that if I took my wrongs in any other way , I should be driven mad !
It is only by <unk> them , and by <unk> them in my mind , and by angrily <unk> the justice I never get , that I am able to keep my wits together .
It is only that ! ” he said , speaking in a homely , rustic way and with great vehemence .
“ You may tell me that I <unk> myself .
I answer that it ’ s in my nature to do it , under wrong , and I must do it .
There ’ s nothing between doing it , and sinking into the smiling state of the poor little mad woman that <unk> the court .
If I was once to sit down under it , I should become imbecile . ” The passion and heat in which he was , and the manner in which his face worked , and the violent <unk> with which he accompanied what he said , were most painful to see .
“ Mr.
Jarndyce , ” he said , “ consider my case .
As true as there is a heaven above us , this is my case .
I am one of two brothers .
My father ( a <unk> ) made a will and left his <unk> and stock and so forth to my mother for her life .
After my mother ’ s death , all was to come to me except a <unk> of three hundred pounds that I was then to pay my brother .
My mother died .
My brother some time afterwards <unk> his <unk> .
I and some of my relations said that he had had a part of it already in board and lodging and some other things .
Now mind !
That was the question , and nothing else .
No one disputed the will ; no one disputed anything but whether part of that three hundred pounds had been already paid or not .
To settle that question , my brother <unk> a bill , I was obliged to go into this <unk> Chancery ; I was forced there because the law forced me and would let me go nowhere else .
<unk> people were made <unk> to that simple suit !
It first came on after two years .
It was then stopped for another two years while the master ( may his head <unk> off ! )
inquired whether I was my father ’ s son , about which there was no dispute at all with any mortal creature .
He then found out that there were not <unk> enough — remember , there were only <unk> as yet ! — but that we must have another who had been left out and must begin all over again .
The costs at that time — before the thing was begun ! — were three times the <unk> .
My brother would have given up the <unk> , and joyful , to escape more costs .
My whole estate , left to me in that will of my father ’ s , has gone in costs .
The suit , still <unk> , has fallen into <unk> , and ruin , and despair , with everything else — and here I stand , this day !
Now , Mr. Jarndyce , in your suit there are thousands and thousands involved , where in mine there are hundreds .
Is mine less hard to bear or is it harder to bear , when my whole living was in it and has been thus <unk> <unk> away ? ” Mr. Jarndyce said that he <unk> with him with all his heart and that he set up no <unk> himself in being <unk> treated by this monstrous system .
“ There again ! ” said Mr. Gridley with no <unk> of his rage .
“ The system !
I am told on all hands , it ’ s the system .
I mustn ’ t look to <unk> .
It ’ s the system .
I mustn ’ t go into court and say , ‘ My Lord , I beg to know this from you — is this right or wrong ?
Have you the face to tell me I have received justice and therefore am dismissed ? ’ My Lord knows nothing of it .
He sits there to <unk> the system .
I mustn ’ t go to Mr. Tulkinghorn , the solicitor in Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields , and say to him when he makes me <unk> by being so cool and satisfied — as they all do , for I know they gain by it while I lose , don ’ t I ? — I mustn ’ t say to him , ‘ I will have something out of some one for my ruin , by fair means or foul ! ’ HE is not responsible .
It ’ s the system .
But , if I do no violence to any of them , here — I may !
I don ’ t know what may happen if I am carried beyond myself at last !
I will <unk> the individual <unk> of that system against me , face to face , before the great eternal bar ! ” His passion was fearful .
I could not have believed in such rage without seeing it .
“ I have done ! ” he said , sitting down and wiping his face .
“ Mr.
Jarndyce , I have done !
I am violent , I know .
I ought to know it .
I have been in prison for contempt of court .
I have been in prison for threatening the solicitor .
I have been in this trouble , and that trouble , and shall be again .
I am the man from Shropshire , and I sometimes go beyond <unk> them , though they have found it <unk> , too , to see me committed into custody and brought up in custody and all that .
It would be better for me , they tell me , if I <unk> myself .
I tell them that if I did <unk> myself I should become imbecile .
I was a <unk> man once , I believe .
People in my part of the country say they remember me so , but now I must have this <unk> under my sense of injury or nothing could hold my wits together .
It would be far better for you , Mr. Gridley , ’ the Lord Chancellor told me last week , ‘ not to waste your time here , and to stay , <unk> employed , down in Shropshire . ’ ‘ My Lord , my Lord , I know it would , ’ said I to him , ‘ and it would have been far better for me never to have heard the name of your high office , but <unk> for me , I can ’ t <unk> the past , and the past drives me here ! ’ Besides , ” he added , breaking <unk> out , “ I ’ ll shame them .
To the last , I ’ ll show myself in that court to its shame .
If I knew when I was going to die , and could be carried there , and had a voice to speak with , I would die there , saying , ‘ You have brought me here and sent me from here many and many a time .
Now send me out feet foremost ! ’ ” His countenance had , perhaps for years , become so set in its <unk> expression that it did not soften , even now when he was quiet .
“ I came to take these <unk> down to my room for an hour , ” he said , going to them again , “ and let them play about .
I didn ’ t mean to say all this , but it don ’ t much <unk> .
You ’ re not afraid of me , Tom , are you ? ” “ No ! ” said Tom .
“ You ain ’ t angry with ME . ” “ You are right , my child .
You ’ re going back , Charley ?
Aye ?
Come then , little one ! ” He took the youngest child on his arm , where she was willing enough to be carried .
“ I shouldn ’ t wonder if we found a <unk> soldier downstairs .
Let ’ s go and look for him ! ” He made his former rough <unk> , which was not deficient in a certain respect , to Mr. Jarndyce , and bowing slightly to us , went downstairs to his room .
Upon that , Mr. Skimpole began to talk , for the first time since our arrival , in his usual gay <unk> .
He said , Well , it was really very pleasant to see how things <unk> adapted themselves to purposes .
Here was this Mr. Gridley , a man of a <unk> will and surprising energy — <unk> speaking , a sort of <unk> <unk> — and he could easily imagine that there Gridley was , years ago , wandering about in life for something to <unk> his superfluous <unk> upon — a sort of Young <unk> among the <unk> — when the Court of Chancery came in his way and <unk> him with the exact thing he wanted .
There they were , <unk> , ever afterwards !
<unk> he might have been a great general , blowing up all sorts of <unk> , or he might have been a great <unk> , dealing in all sorts of <unk> <unk> ; but as it was , he and the Court of Chancery had fallen upon each other in the pleasantest way , and nobody was much the worse , and Gridley was , so to speak , from that hour provided for .
Then look at Coavinses !
How <unk> poor Coavinses ( father of these charming children ) <unk> the same principle !
He , Mr. Skimpole , himself , had sometimes <unk> at the existence of Coavinses .
He had found Coavinses in his way .
He could had dispensed with Coavinses .
There had been times when , if he had been a <unk> , and his grand <unk> had said one morning , “ What does the <unk> of the <unk> require at the hands of his <unk> ? ” he might have even gone so far as to reply , “ The head of Coavinses ! ” But what turned out to be the case ?
That , all that time , he had been giving employment to a most <unk> man , that he had been a benefactor to Coavinses , that he had actually been <unk> Coavinses to bring up these charming children in this agreeable way , <unk> these social virtues !
<unk> that his heart had just now swelled and the tears had come into his eyes when he had looked round the room and thought , “ I was the great patron of Coavinses , and his little comforts were MY work ! ” There was something so captivating in his light way of touching these <unk> strings , and he was such a <unk> child by the side of the <unk> childhood we had seen , that he made my guardian smile even as he turned towards us from a little private talk with Mrs. Blinder .
We kissed Charley , and took her downstairs with us , and stopped outside the house to see her run away to her work .
I don ’ t know where she was going , but we saw her run , such a little , little creature in her womanly bonnet and apron , through a covered way at the bottom of the court and <unk> into the city ’ s <unk> and sound like a <unk> in an <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> Tom-all-Alone ’ s My Lady Dedlock is restless , very restless .
The astonished fashionable intelligence hardly knows where to have her .
<unk> she is at Chesney Wold ; yesterday she was at her house in town ; to-morrow she may be abroad , for anything the fashionable intelligence can with confidence <unk> .
Even Sir Leicester ’ s gallantry has some trouble to keep pace with her .
It would have more but that his other faithful <unk> , for better and for worse — the gout — <unk> into the old <unk> <unk> at Chesney Wold and <unk> him by both legs .
Sir Leicester receives the gout as a troublesome demon , but still a demon of the <unk> order .
All the Dedlocks , in the direct <unk> line , through a course of time during and beyond which the memory of man <unk> not to the contrary , have had the gout .
It can be proved , sir .
Other men ’ s fathers may have died of the <unk> or may have taken base <unk> from the <unk> blood of the sick <unk> , but the Dedlock family have communicated something <unk> even to the <unk> process of dying by dying of their own family gout .
It has come down through the illustrious line like the plate , or the pictures , or the place in Lincolnshire .
It is among their <unk> .
Sir Leicester is perhaps not wholly without an impression , though he has never resolved it into words , that the angel of death in the discharge of his necessary duties may observe to the shades of the <unk> , “ My <unk> and gentlemen , I have the honour to present to you another Dedlock <unk> to have arrived <unk> the family gout . ” Hence Sir Leicester <unk> up his family legs to the family disorder as if he held his name and fortune on that <unk> <unk> .
He feels that for a Dedlock to be laid upon his back and <unk> <unk> and <unk> in his <unk> is a liberty taken somewhere , but he thinks , “ We have all yielded to this ; it <unk> to us ; it has for some hundreds of years been understood that we are not to make the <unk> in the park interesting on more <unk> terms ; and I submit myself to the compromise . ” And a goodly show he makes , lying in a flush of <unk> and gold in the midst of the great drawing-room before his favourite picture of my Lady , with broad <unk> of sunlight shining in , down the long perspective , through the long line of windows , and <unk> with soft <unk> of shadow .
<unk> , the stately <unk> , rooted for ages in the green ground which has never known <unk> , but was still a <unk> when <unk> rode to <unk> with <unk> and <unk> and rode <unk> with bow and <unk> , bear witness to his greatness .
<unk> , his <unk> , looking on him from the walls , say , “ <unk> of us was a passing reality here and left this coloured shadow of himself and melted into remembrance as <unk> as the distant voices of the <unk> now <unk> you to rest , ” and hear their testimony to his greatness too .
And he is very great this day .
And <unk> to Boythorn or other <unk> <unk> who shall <unk> <unk> an <unk> with him !
My Lady is at present represented , near Sir Leicester , by her portrait .
She has <unk> away to town , with no intention of remaining there , and will soon <unk> <unk> again , to the confusion of the fashionable intelligence .
The house in town is not prepared for her reception .
It is muffled and dreary .
Only one Mercury in powder <unk> <unk> at the <unk> ; and he mentioned last night to another Mercury of his acquaintance , also accustomed to good society , that if that sort of thing was to last — which it couldn ’ t , for a man of his spirits couldn ’ t bear it , and a man of his figure couldn ’ t be expected to bear it — there would be no <unk> for him , upon his honour , but to cut his throat !
What connexion can there be between the place in Lincolnshire , the house in town , the Mercury in powder , and the <unk> of Jo the <unk> with the broom , who had that distant ray of light upon him when he <unk> the <unk> ?
What connexion can there have been between many people in the innumerable <unk> of this world who from opposite sides of great <unk> have , <unk> , been very curiously brought together !
Jo sweeps his crossing all day long , unconscious of the link , if any link there be .
He <unk> up his mental condition when asked a question by replying that he “ don ’ t know nothink . ” He knows that it ’ s hard to keep the mud off the crossing in dirty weather , and harder still to live by doing it .
Nobody taught him even that much ; he found it out .
Jo lives — that is to say , Jo has not yet died — in a <unk> place known to the like of him by the name of Tom-all-Alone ’ s .
It is a black , <unk> street , <unk> by all decent people , where the crazy houses were seized upon , when their <unk> was far advanced , by some bold <unk> who after <unk> their own possession took to letting them out in lodgings .
Now , these tumbling <unk> contain , by night , a <unk> of misery .
As on the ruined human wretch <unk> <unk> appear , so these ruined <unk> have bred a crowd of foul existence that <unk> in and out of <unk> in walls and <unk> ; and <unk> itself to sleep , in <unk> <unk> , where the rain <unk> in ; and comes and goes , <unk> and carrying fever and <unk> more evil in its every <unk> than Lord Coodle , and Sir Thomas Doodle , and the <unk> of <unk> , and all the fine gentlemen in office , down to <unk> , shall set right in five hundred years — though born expressly to do it .
<unk> lately there has been a crash and a cloud of dust , like the <unk> of a mine , in Tom-all-Alone ’ s ; and each time a house has fallen .
These <unk> have made a paragraph in the newspapers and have filled a bed or two in the nearest hospital .
The <unk> remain , and there are not <unk> lodgings among the rubbish .
As several more houses are nearly ready to go , the next crash in Tom-all-Alone ’ s may be expected to be a good one .
This desirable property is in Chancery , of course .
It would be an <unk> to the <unk> of any man with half an eye to tell him so .
Whether “ Tom ” is the popular representative of the original <unk> or <unk> in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , or whether Tom lived here when the suit had laid the street waste , all alone , until other <unk> came to join him , or whether the <unk> title is a <unk> name for a retreat cut off from honest company and put out of the pale of hope , perhaps nobody knows .
Certainly Jo don ’ t know .
“ For I don ’ t , ” says Jo , “ I don ’ t know nothink . ” It must be a strange state to be like Jo !
To shuffle through the streets , <unk> with the shapes , and in utter darkness as to the meaning , of those mysterious <unk> , so <unk> over the shops , and at the corners of streets , and on the doors , and in the windows !
To see people read , and to see people write , and to see the <unk> deliver letters , and not to have the least idea of all that language — to be , to every scrap of it , stone blind and dumb !
It must be very <unk> to see the good company going to the <unk> on Sundays , with their books in their hands , and to think ( for perhaps Jo <unk> think at odd times ) what does it all mean , and if it means anything to anybody , how comes it that it means nothing to me ?
To be <unk> , and <unk> , and moved on ; and really to feel that it would appear to be perfectly true that I have no business here , or there , or anywhere ; and yet to be perplexed by the consideration that I AM here somehow , too , and everybody <unk> me until I became the creature that I am !
It must be a strange state , not merely to be told that I am scarcely human ( as in the case of my offering myself for a witness ) , but to feel it of my own knowledge all my life !
To see the horses , dogs , and <unk> go by me and to know that in ignorance I belong to them and not to the superior <unk> in my shape , whose delicacy I <unk> !
Jo ’ s ideas of a <unk> trial , or a judge , or a <unk> , or a government , or that <unk> jewel to him ( if he only knew it ) the <unk> , should be strange !
His whole material and <unk> life is wonderfully strange ; his death , the <unk> thing of all .
Jo comes out of Tom-all-Alone ’ s , meeting the <unk> morning which is always late in getting down there , and <unk> his dirty bit of bread as he comes along .
His way lying through many streets , and the houses not yet being open , he sits down to breakfast on the door-step of the <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> <unk> and gives it a brush when he has finished as an acknowledgment of the <unk> .
He <unk> the size of the <unk> and wonders what it ’ s all about .
He has no idea , poor wretch , of the spiritual <unk> of a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> or what it costs to look up the precious <unk> among the <unk> and <unk> .
He goes to his crossing and begins to lay it out for the day .
The town <unk> ; the great <unk> is set up for its daily <unk> and <unk> ; all that unaccountable reading and writing , which has been <unk> for a few hours , <unk> .
Jo and the other lower <unk> get on in the <unk> <unk> as they can .
It is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , never guided , run into wrong places and are beaten out , and <unk> <unk> and <unk> at stone walls , and often <unk> hurt the innocent , and often <unk> hurt themselves .
Very like Jo and his order ; very , very like !
A <unk> of music comes and plays .
Jo listens to it .
So does a dog — a <unk> ’ s dog , waiting for his master outside a butcher ’ s shop , and evidently thinking about those sheep he has had upon his mind for some hours and is happily rid of .
He seems perplexed respecting three or four , can ’ t remember where he left them , looks up and down the street as half expecting to see them <unk> , suddenly <unk> up his ears and remembers all about it .
A thoroughly vagabond dog , accustomed to low company and <unk> ; a terrific dog to sheep , ready at a whistle to <unk> over their backs and tear out <unk> of their <unk> ; but an educated , improved , developed dog who has been taught his duties and knows how to discharge them .
He and Jo listen to the music , probably with much the same amount of animal satisfaction ; likewise as to awakened association , <unk> , or regret , melancholy or joyful reference to things beyond the senses , they are probably upon a <unk> .
But , otherwise , how far above the human <unk> is the <unk> !
<unk> that dog ’ s <unk> wild , like Jo , and in a very few years they will so <unk> that they will lose even their bark — but not their bite .
The day changes as it wears itself away and becomes dark and <unk> .
Jo <unk> it out at his crossing among the mud and wheels , the horses , <unk> , and <unk> , and gets but a <unk> sum to pay for the <unk> shelter of Tom-all-Alone ’ s .
<unk> comes on ; gas begins to start up in the shops ; the <unk> , with his <unk> , runs along the <unk> of the pavement .
A wretched evening is beginning to close in .
In his chambers Mr. Tulkinghorn sits <unk> an application to the nearest <unk> to-morrow morning for a <unk> .
Gridley , a disappointed suitor , has been here to-day and has been <unk> .
We are not to be put in bodily fear , and that <unk> fellow shall be held to <unk> again .
From the ceiling , <unk> Allegory , in the person of one impossible Roman <unk> down , points with the arm of <unk> ( out of <unk> , and an odd one ) <unk> <unk> the window .
Why should Mr. Tulkinghorn , for such no reason , look out of window ?
Is the hand not always pointing there ?
So he does not look out of window .
And if he did , what would it be to see a woman going by ?
There are women enough in the world , Mr. Tulkinghorn thinks — too many ; they are at the bottom of all that goes wrong in it , though , for the matter of that , they <unk> business for lawyers .
What would it be to see a woman going by , even though she were going secretly ?
They are all secret .
Mr. Tulkinghorn knows that very well .
But they are not all like the woman who now leaves him and his house behind , between whose plain dress and her <unk> manner there is something exceedingly <unk> .
She should be an upper servant by her <unk> , yet in her air and step , though both are hurried and assumed — as far as she can <unk> in the muddy streets , which she <unk> with an <unk> foot — she is a lady .
Her face is <unk> , and still she sufficiently <unk> herself to make more than one of those who pass her look round sharply .
She never turns her head .
Lady or servant , she has a purpose in her and can follow it .
She never turns her head until she comes to the crossing where Jo <unk> with his broom .
He crosses with her and begs .
Still , she does not turn her head until she has <unk> on the other side .
Then she slightly beckons to him and says , “ Come here ! ” Jo follows her a pace or two into a quiet court .
“ Are you the boy I ’ ve read of in the papers ? ” she asked behind her veil .
“ I don ’ t know , ” says Jo , staring moodily at the veil , “ nothink about no papers .
I don ’ t know nothink about nothink at all . ” “ <unk> you examined at an inquest ? ” “ I don ’ t know nothink about no — where I was took by the beadle , do you mean ? ” says Jo .
“ Was the boy ’ s name at the inkwhich Jo ? ” “ Yes . ” “ That ’ s me ! ” says Jo .
“ Come farther up . ” “ You mean about the man ? ” says Jo , following .
“ Him as wos dead ? ” “ Hush !
Speak in a whisper !
Yes .
Did he look , when he was living , so very ill and poor ? ” “ Oh , <unk> ! ” says Jo .
“ Did he look like — not like YOU ? ” says the woman with <unk> .
“ Oh , not so bad as me , ” says Jo .
“ I ’ m a <unk> ’ <unk> one I am !
You didn ’ t know him , did you ? ” “ How dare you ask me if I knew him ? ” “ No offence , my lady , ” says Jo with much humility , for even he has got at the suspicion of her being a lady .
“ I am not a lady .
I am a servant . ” “ You are a <unk> servant ! ” says Jo without the least idea of saying anything offensive , merely as a tribute of admiration .
“ Listen and be silent .
Don ’ t talk to me , and stand farther from me !
Can you show me all those places that were spoken of in the account I read ?
The place he wrote for , the place he died at , the place where you were taken to , and the place where he was buried ?
Do you know the place where he was buried ? ” Jo answers with a nod , having also nodded as each other place was mentioned .
“ Go before me and show me all those dreadful places .
Stop opposite to each , and don ’ t speak to me unless I speak to you .
Don ’ t look back .
Do what I want , and I will pay you well . ” Jo <unk> closely while the words are being spoken ; tells them off on his <unk> , finding them rather hard ; pauses to consider their meaning ; considers it satisfactory ; and nods his ragged head .
“ I ’ m fly , ” says Jo .
“ But <unk> <unk> , you know .
<unk> <unk> it ! ” “ What does the horrible creature mean ? ” exclaims the servant , <unk> from him .
“ <unk> cutting away , you know ! ” says Jo .
“ I don ’ t understand you .
Go on before !
I will give you more money than you ever had in your life . ” Jo <unk> up his mouth into a whistle , gives his ragged head a rub , takes his broom under his arm , and leads the way , passing <unk> with his bare feet over the hard stones and through the mud and mire .
Cook ’ s Court .
Jo stops .
A pause .
“ Who lives here ? ” “ Him wot give him his writing and give me half a bull , ” says Jo in a whisper without looking over his shoulder .
“ Go on to the next . ” Krook ’ s house .
Jo stops again .
A longer pause .
“ Who lives here ? ” “ HE lived here , ” Jo answers as before .
After a silence he is asked , “ In which room ? ” “ In the back room up there .
You can see the <unk> from this corner .
Up there !
That ’ s where I see him <unk> out .
This is the <unk> where I was took to . ” “ Go on to the next ! ” It is a longer walk to the next , but Jo , relieved of his first suspicions , sticks to the forms <unk> upon him and does not look round .
By many <unk> ways , <unk> with offence of many kinds , they come to the little <unk> of a court , and to the <unk> ( lighted now ) , and to the iron gate .
“ He was put there , ” says Jo , holding to the bars and looking in .
“ Where ?
Oh , what a scene of horror ! ” “ There ! ” says Jo , pointing .
“ Over <unk> .
Among them piles of bones , and close to that there <unk> <unk> !
They put him wery <unk> the top .
They was obliged to stamp upon it to <unk> it in .
I could <unk> it for you with my broom if the gate was open .
That ’ s why they locks it , I s ’ <unk> , ” giving it a shake .
“ It ’ s always locked .
Look at the <unk> ! ” cries Jo , excited .
“ Hi !
Look !
There he goes !
Ho !
Into the ground ! ” The servant <unk> into a corner , into a corner of that hideous archway , with its deadly <unk> <unk> her dress ; and putting out her two hands and <unk> telling him to keep away from her , for he is <unk> to her , so remains for some moments .
Jo stands staring and is still staring when she recovers herself .
“ Is this place of <unk> <unk> ground ? ” “ I don ’ t know nothink of <unk> ground , ” says Jo , still staring .
“ Is it blessed ? ” “ Which ? ” says Jo , in the last degree amazed .
“ Is it blessed ? ” “ I ’ m blest if I know , ” says Jo , staring more than ever ; “ but I shouldn ’ t think it warn ’ t .
<unk> ? ” repeats Jo , something troubled in his mind .
“ It an ’ t done it much good if it is .
<unk> ?
I should think it was t ’ <unk> myself .
But I don ’ t know nothink ! ” The servant takes as little <unk> of what he says as she seems to take of what she has said herself .
She draws off her glove to get some money from her purse .
Jo silently <unk> how white and small her hand is and what a <unk> servant she must be to wear such sparkling rings .
She drops a piece of money in his hand without touching it , and <unk> as their hands approach .
“ Now , ” she adds , “ show me the spot again ! ” Jo <unk> the handle of his broom between the bars of the gate , and with his utmost power of <unk> , points it out .
At length , looking aside to see if he has made himself <unk> , he finds that he is alone .
His first proceeding is to hold the piece of money to the <unk> and to be overpowered at finding that it is yellow — gold .
His next is to give it a <unk> bite at the <unk> as a <unk> of its quality .
His next , to put it in his mouth for <unk> and to sweep the step and passage with great care .
His job done , he sets off for Tom-all-Alone ’ s , stopping in the light of innumerable <unk> to produce the piece of gold and give it another <unk> bite as a <unk> of its being genuine .
The Mercury in powder is in no want of society to-night , for my Lady goes to a grand dinner and three or four <unk> .
Sir Leicester is <unk> down at Chesney Wold , with no better company than the gout ; he <unk> to Mrs. Rouncewell that the rain makes such a monotonous <unk> on the terrace that he can ’ t read the paper even by the fireside in his own <unk> <unk> .
“ Sir Leicester would have done better to try the other side of the house , my dear , ” says Mrs. Rouncewell to Rosa .
“ His <unk> is on my Lady ’ s side .
And in all these years I never heard the step upon the Ghost ’ s Walk more <unk> than it is to-night ! ” CHAPTER <unk> Esther ’ s Narrative Richard very often came to see us while we remained in London ( though he soon failed in his <unk> ) , and with his quick <unk> , his good spirits , his good temper , his gaiety and <unk> , was always delightful .
But though I liked him more and more the better I knew him , I still felt more and more how much it was to be regretted that he had been educated in no habits of application and <unk> .
The system which had addressed him in exactly the same manner as it had addressed hundreds of other boys , all <unk> in character and capacity , had <unk> him to <unk> through his <unk> , always with fair credit and often with distinction , but in a <unk> , <unk> way that had confirmed his reliance on those very qualities in himself which it had been most desirable to direct and train .
They were good qualities , without which no high place can be <unk> won , but like fire and water , though excellent servants , they were very bad masters .
If they had been under Richard ’ s direction , they would have been his friends ; but Richard being under their direction , they became his enemies .
I write down these opinions not because I believe that this or any other thing was so because I thought so , but only because I did think so and I want to be quite candid about all I thought and did .
These were my thoughts about Richard .
I thought I often observed besides how right my guardian was in what he had said , and that the <unk> and <unk> of the Chancery suit had imparted to his nature something of the careless spirit of a <unk> who felt that he was part of a great <unk> system .
Mr. and Mrs. Bayham Badger coming one afternoon when my guardian was not at home , in the course of conversation I naturally inquired after Richard .
“ Why , Mr. Carstone , ” said Mrs. Badger , “ is very well and is , I assure you , a great <unk> to our society .
Captain Swosser used to say of me that I was always better than land <unk> and a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> ’ s <unk> when the <unk> ’ s <unk> had become as <unk> as the <unk> weather <unk> .
It was his <unk> way of mentioning generally that I was an <unk> to any society .
I may render the same tribute , I am sure , to Mr. Carstone .
But I — you won ’ t think me <unk> if I mention it ? ” I said no , as Mrs. Badger ’ s <unk> tone seemed to require such an answer .
“ Nor Miss Clare ? ” said Mrs. Bayham Badger <unk> .
Ada said no , too , and looked uneasy .
“ Why , you see , my dears , ” said Mrs. Badger , “ — you ’ ll excuse me calling you my dears ? ” We entreated Mrs. Badger not to mention it .
“ Because you really are , if I may take the liberty of saying so , ” pursued Mrs. Badger , “ so perfectly charming .
You see , my dears , that although I am still young — or Mr. Bayham Badger <unk> me the compliment of saying so — ” “ No , ” Mr. Badger called out like some one <unk> at a public meeting .
“ Not at all ! ” “ Very well , ” smiled Mrs. Badger , “ we will say still young . ” “ <unk> , ” said Mr. Badger .
“ My dears , though still young , I have had many opportunities of observing young men .
There were many such on board the dear old <unk> , I assure you .
After that , when I was with Captain Swosser in the <unk> , I <unk> every opportunity of knowing and <unk> the <unk> under Captain Swosser ’ s command .
YOU never heard them called the young gentlemen , my dears , and probably would not understand <unk> to their <unk> their <unk> accounts , but it is otherwise with me , for blue water has been a second home to me , and I have been quite a sailor .
Again , with Professor Dingo . ” “ A man of <unk> reputation , ” murmured Mr. Badger .
“ When I lost my dear first and became the wife of my dear second , ” said Mrs. Badger , speaking of her former husbands as if they were parts of a <unk> , “ I still enjoyed opportunities of observing youth .
The class attendant on Professor Dingo ’ s lectures was a large one , and it became my pride , as the wife of an eminent <unk> man seeking herself in science the utmost consolation it could <unk> , to throw our house open to the <unk> as a kind of <unk> <unk> .
Every <unk> evening there was <unk> and a mixed <unk> for all who <unk> to partake of those <unk> .
And there was science to an <unk> extent . ” “ <unk> <unk> those , Miss Summerson , ” said Mr. Badger <unk> .
“ There must have been great intellectual <unk> going on there under the <unk> of such a man ! ” “ And now , ” pursued Mrs. Badger , “ now that I am the wife of my dear third , Mr. Badger , I still pursue those habits of observation which were formed during the lifetime of Captain Swosser and adapted to new and unexpected purposes during the lifetime of Professor Dingo .
I therefore have not come to the consideration of Mr. Carstone as a <unk> .
And yet I am very much of the opinion , my dears , that he has not chosen his profession <unk> . ” Ada looked so very anxious now that I asked Mrs. Badger on what she founded her <unk> .
“ My dear Miss Summerson , ” she replied , “ on Mr. Carstone ’ s character and conduct .
He is of such a very easy disposition that probably he would never think it worth while to mention how he really feels , but he feels languid about the profession .
He has not that positive interest in it which makes it his <unk> .
If he has any decided impression in reference to it , I should say it was that it is a tiresome pursuit .
Now , this is not promising .
Young men like Mr. Allan Woodcourt who take it from a strong interest in all that it can do will find some reward in it through a great deal of work for a very little money and through years of considerable <unk> and disappointment .
But I am quite convinced that this would never be the case with Mr. Carstone . ” “ Does Mr. Badger think so too ? ” asked Ada timidly .
“ Why , ” said Mr. Badger , “ to tell the truth , Miss Clare , this view of the matter had not occurred to me until Mrs. Badger mentioned it .
But when Mrs. Badger put it in that light , I naturally gave great consideration to it , knowing that Mrs. Badger ’ s mind , in addition to its natural advantages , has had the rare advantage of being formed by two such very distinguished ( I will even say illustrious ) public men as Captain Swosser of the Royal <unk> and Professor Dingo .
The conclusion at which I have arrived is — in short , is Mrs. Badger ’ s conclusion . ” “ It was a <unk> of Captain Swosser ’ s , ” said Mrs. Badger , “ speaking in his <unk> <unk> manner , that when you make pitch hot , you cannot make it too hot ; and that if you only have to <unk> a <unk> , you should <unk> it as if <unk> <unk> were after you .
It appears to me that this <unk> is applicable to the medical as well as to the <unk> profession . ” “ To all <unk> , ” observed Mr. Badger .
“ It was <unk> said by Captain Swosser .
<unk> said . ” “ People <unk> to Professor Dingo when we were staying in the north of <unk> after our marriage , ” said Mrs. Badger , “ that he <unk> some of the houses and other buildings by <unk> off fragments of those <unk> with his little <unk> hammer .
But the professor replied that he knew of no building save the Temple of <unk> .
The principle is the same , I think ? ” “ <unk> the same , ” said Mr. Badger .
“ <unk> expressed !
The professor made the same remark , Miss Summerson , in his last illness , when ( his mind wandering ) he <unk> on keeping his little hammer under the pillow and <unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> .
The <unk> passion ! ” Although we could have dispensed with the length at which Mr. and Mrs. Badger pursued the conversation , we both felt that it was disinterested in them to express the opinion they had communicated to us and that there was a great probability of its being sound .
We agreed to say nothing to Mr. Jarndyce until we had spoken to Richard ; and as he was coming next evening , we resolved to have a very serious talk with him .
So after he had been a little while with Ada , I went in and found my darling ( as I knew she would be ) prepared to consider him thoroughly right in whatever he said .
“ And how do you get on , Richard ? ” said I. I always sat down on the other side of him .
He made quite a sister of me .
“ Oh !
Well enough ! ” said Richard .
“ He can ’ t say better than that , Esther , can he ? ” cried my pet triumphantly .
I tried to look at my pet in the <unk> manner , but of course I couldn ’ t .
“ Well enough ? ” I repeated .
“ Yes , ” said Richard , “ well enough .
It ’ s rather <unk> and <unk> .
But it ’ ll do as well as anything else ! ” “ Oh !
My dear Richard ! ” I remonstrated .
“ What ’ s the matter ? ” said Richard .
“ Do as well as anything else ! ” “ I don ’ t think there ’ s any harm in that , Dame Durden , ” said Ada , looking so <unk> at me across him ; “ because if it will do as well as anything else , it will do very well , I hope . ” “ Oh , yes , I hope so , ” returned Richard , carelessly <unk> his hair from his forehead .
“ After all , it may be only a kind of <unk> till our suit is — I forgot though .
I am not to mention the suit .
<unk> ground !
Oh , yes , it ’ s all right enough .
Let us talk about something else . ” Ada would have done so willingly , and with a full <unk> that we had brought the question to a most satisfactory state .
But I thought it would be useless to stop there , so I began again .
“ No , but Richard , ” said I , “ and my dear Ada !
<unk> how important it is to you both , and what a point of honour it is towards your cousin , that you , Richard , should be quite in earnest without any reservation .
I think we had better talk about this , really , Ada .
It will be too late very soon . ” “ Oh , yes !
We must talk about it ! ” said Ada .
“ But I think Richard is right . ” What was the use of my trying to look wise when she was so pretty , and so engaging , and so fond of him !
“ Mr.
and Mrs. Badger were here yesterday , Richard , ” said I , “ and they seemed disposed to think that you had no great liking for the profession . ” “ Did they though ? ” said Richard .
“ Oh !
Well , that rather <unk> the case , because I had no idea that they thought so , and I should not have liked to <unk> or inconvenience them .
The fact is , I don ’ t care much about it .
But , oh , it don ’ t matter !
It ’ ll do as well as anything else ! ” “ You hear him , Ada ! ” said I.
“ The fact is , ” Richard proceeded , half thoughtfully and half <unk> , “ it is not quite in my way .
I don ’ t take to it .
And I get too much of Mrs. Bayham Badger ’ s first and second . ” “ I am sure THAT ’ S very natural ! ” cried Ada , quite delighted .
“ The very thing we both said yesterday , Esther ! ” “ Then , ” pursued Richard , “ it ’ s monotonous , and to-day is too like yesterday , and to-morrow is too like to-day . ” “ But I am afraid , ” said I , “ this is an objection to all kinds of application — to life itself , except under some very uncommon circumstances . ” “ Do you think so ? ” returned Richard , still considering .
“ Perhaps !
Ha !
Why , then , you know , ” he added , suddenly becoming gay again , “ we travel outside a circle to what I said just now .
It ’ ll do as well as anything else .
Oh , it ’ s all right enough !
Let us talk about something else . ” But even Ada , with her loving face — and if it had seemed innocent and trusting when I first saw it in that memorable November fog , how much more did it seem now when I knew her innocent and trusting heart — even Ada shook her head at this and looked serious .
So I thought it a good opportunity to hint to Richard that if he were sometimes a little careless of himself , I was very sure he never meant to be careless of Ada , and that it was a part of his affectionate consideration for her not to slight the importance of a step that might influence both their lives .
This made him almost grave .
“ My dear Mother <unk> , ” he said , “ that ’ s the very thing !
I have thought of that several times and have been quite angry with myself for meaning to be so much in earnest and — somehow — not exactly being so .
I don ’ t know how it is ; I seem to want something or other to stand by .
Even you have no idea how fond I am of Ada ( my darling cousin , I love you , so much !
) , but I don ’ t settle down to constancy in other things .
It ’ s such <unk> work , and it takes such a time ! ” said Richard with an air of vexation .
“ That may be , ” I suggested , “ because you don ’ t like what you have chosen . ” “ Poor fellow ! ” said Ada .
“ I am sure I don ’ t wonder at it ! ” No .
It was not of the least use my trying to look wise .
I tried again , but how could I do it , or how could it have any effect if I could , while Ada rested her clasped hands upon his shoulder and while he looked at her tender blue eyes , and while they looked at him !
“ You see , my precious girl , ” said Richard , passing her golden <unk> through and through his hand , “ I was a little hasty perhaps ; or I <unk> my own <unk> perhaps .
They don ’ t seem to lie in that direction .
I couldn ’ t tell till I tried .
Now the question is whether it ’ s <unk> to <unk> all that has been done .
It seems like making a great <unk> about nothing particular . ” “ My dear Richard , ” said I , “ how CAN you say about nothing particular ? ” “ I don ’ t mean absolutely that , ” he returned .
“ I mean that it <unk> be nothing particular because I may never want it . ” Both Ada and I urged , in reply , not only that it was decidedly <unk> to <unk> what had been done , but that it must be undone .
I then asked Richard whether he had thought of any more congenial pursuit .
“ There , my dear Mrs. <unk> , ” said Richard , “ you touch me home .
Yes , I have .
I have been thinking that the law is the boy for me . ” “ The law ! ” repeated Ada as if she were afraid of the name .
“ If I went into Kenge ’ s office , ” said Richard , “ and if I were placed under articles to Kenge , I should have my eye on the — hum ! — the <unk> ground — and should be able to study it , and master it , and to satisfy myself that it was not neglected and was being <unk> conducted .
I should be able to look after Ada ’ s interests and my own interests ( the same thing !
) ; and I should <unk> away at <unk> and all those <unk> with the most tremendous ardour . ” I was not by any means so sure of that , and I saw how his <unk> after the vague things yet to come of those <unk> hopes cast a shade on Ada ’ s face .
But I thought it best to encourage him in any project of <unk> exertion , and only advised him to be quite sure that his mind was made up now .
“ My dear <unk> , ” said Richard , “ I am as steady as you are .
I made a mistake ; we are all liable to mistakes ; I won ’ t do so any more , and I ’ ll become such a lawyer as is not often seen .
That is , you know , ” said Richard , relapsing into doubt , “ if it really is <unk> , after all , to make such a <unk> about nothing particular ! ” This led to our saying again , with a great deal of gravity , all that we had said already and to our coming to much the same conclusion afterwards .
But we so strongly advised Richard to be frank and open with Mr. Jarndyce , without a moment ’ s delay , and his disposition was naturally so <unk> to <unk> that he sought him out at once ( taking us with him ) and made a full <unk> .
“ Rick , ” said my guardian , after hearing him attentively , “ we can retreat with honour , and we will .
But we must be careful — for our cousin ’ s sake , Rick , for our cousin ’ s sake — that we make no more such mistakes .
Therefore , in the matter of the law , we will have a good trial before we decide .
We will look before we <unk> , and take plenty of time about it . ” Richard ’ s energy was of such an impatient and <unk> kind that he would have liked nothing better than to have gone to Mr. Kenge ’ s office in that hour and to have entered into articles with him on the spot .
<unk> , however , with a good grace to the caution that we had shown to be so necessary , he contented himself with sitting down among us in his <unk> spirits and talking as if his one <unk> purpose in life from childhood had been that one which now held possession of him .
My guardian was very kind and cordial with him , but rather grave , enough so to cause Ada , when he had departed and we were going upstairs to bed , to say , “ Cousin John , I hope you don ’ t think the worse of Richard ? ” “ No , my love , ” said he .
“ Because it was very natural that Richard should be mistaken in such a difficult case .
It is not uncommon . ” “ No , no , my love , ” said he .
“ Don ’ t look unhappy . ” “ Oh , I am not unhappy , cousin John ! ” said Ada , smiling cheerfully , with her hand upon his shoulder , where she had put it in <unk> him good night .
“ But I should be a little so if you thought at all the worse of Richard . ” “ My dear , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , “ I should think the worse of him only if you were ever in the least unhappy through his means .
I should be more disposed to quarrel with myself even then , than with poor Rick , for I brought you together .
But , <unk> , all this is nothing !
He has time before him , and the race to run .
I think the worse of him ?
Not I , my loving cousin !
And not you , I <unk> ! ” “ No , indeed , cousin John , ” said Ada , “ I am sure I could not — I am sure I would not — think any ill of Richard if the whole world did .
I could , and I would , think better of him then than at any other time ! ” So quietly and <unk> she said it , with her hands upon his shoulders — both hands now — and looking up into his face , like the picture of truth !
“ I think , ” said my guardian , thoughtfully regarding her , “ I think it must be somewhere written that the virtues of the mothers shall occasionally be visited on the children , as well as the sins of the father .
Good night , my <unk> .
Good night , little woman .
Pleasant <unk> !
<unk> <unk> ! ” This was the first time I ever saw him follow Ada with his eyes with something of a shadow on their benevolent expression .
I well remembered the look with which he had contemplated her and Richard when she was singing in the <unk> ; it was but a very little while since he had watched them passing down the room in which the sun was shining , and away into the shade ; but his glance was changed , and even the silent look of confidence in me which now followed it once more was not quite so hopeful and <unk> as it had originally been .
Ada praised Richard more to me that night than ever she had praised him yet .
She went to sleep with a little <unk> he had given her clasped upon her arm .
I fancied she was <unk> of him when I kissed her cheek after she had slept an hour and saw how tranquil and happy she looked .
For I was so little inclined to sleep myself that night that I sat up working .
It would not be worth mentioning for its own sake , but I was <unk> and rather low-spirited .
I don ’ t know why .
At least I don ’ t think I know why .
At least , perhaps I do , but I don ’ t think it matters .
At any rate , I made up my mind to be so dreadfully industrious that I would leave myself not a moment ’ s leisure to be low-spirited .
For I naturally said , “ Esther !
You to be low-spirited .
YOU ! ” And it really was time to say so , for I — yes , I really did see myself in the glass , almost crying .
“ As if you had anything to make you unhappy , instead of everything to make you happy , you ungrateful heart ! ” said I.
If I could have made myself go to sleep , I would have done it directly , but not being able to do that , I took out of my basket some <unk> work for our house ( I mean Bleak House ) that I was busy with at that time and sat down to it with great determination .
It was necessary to <unk> all the <unk> in that work , and I resolved to go on with it until I couldn ’ t keep my eyes open , and then to go to bed .
I soon found myself very busy .
But I had left some silk downstairs in a <unk> drawer in the temporary growlery , and coming to a stop for want of it , I took my candle and went softly down to get it .
To my great surprise , on going in I found my guardian still there , and sitting looking at the ashes .
He was lost in thought , his book lay <unk> by his side , his <unk> <unk> hair was scattered <unk> upon his forehead as though his hand had been wandering among it while his thoughts were elsewhere , and his face looked worn .
<unk> frightened by coming upon him so unexpectedly , I stood still for a moment and should have retired without speaking had he not , in again passing his hand <unk> through his hair , seen me and started .
“ Esther ! ” I told him what I had come for .
“ At work so late , my dear ? ” “ I am working late to-night , ” said I , “ because I couldn ’ t sleep and wished to tire myself .
But , dear guardian , you are late too , and look weary .
You have no trouble , I hope , to keep you waking ? ” “ None , little woman , that YOU would readily understand , ” said he .
He spoke in a <unk> tone so new to me that I <unk> repeated , as if that would help me to his meaning , “ That I could readily understand ! ” “ <unk> a moment , Esther , ” said he , “ You were in my thoughts . ” “ I hope I was not the trouble , guardian ? ” He slightly <unk> his hand and fell into his usual manner .
The change was so remarkable , and he appeared to make it by <unk> of so much <unk> , that I found myself again <unk> repeating , “ None that I could understand ! ” “ Little woman , ” said my guardian , “ I was thinking — that is , I have been thinking since I have been sitting here — that you ought to know of your own history all I know .
It is very little .
Next to nothing . ” “ Dear guardian , ” I replied , “ when you spoke to me before on that subject — ” “ But since then , ” he gravely interposed , anticipating what I meant to say , “ I have reflected that your having anything to ask me , and my having anything to tell you , are different considerations , Esther .
It is perhaps my duty to <unk> to you the little I know . ” “ If you think so , guardian , it is right . ” “ I think so , ” he returned very gently , and kindly , and very distinctly .
“ My dear , I think so now .
If any real disadvantage can <unk> to your position in the mind of any man or woman worth a thought , it is right that you at least of all the world should not <unk> it to yourself by having vague impressions of its nature . ” I sat down and said after a little effort to be as calm as I ought to be , “ One of my <unk> remembrances , guardian , is of these words : ‘ Your mother , Esther , is your disgrace , and you were hers .
The time will come , and soon enough , when you will understand this better , and will feel it too , as no one save a woman can . ’ ” I had covered my face with my hands in repeating the words , but I took them away now with a better kind of shame , I hope , and told him that to him I owed the blessing that I had from my childhood to that hour never , never , never felt it .
He put up his hand as if to stop me .
I well knew that he was never to be thanked , and said no more .
“ <unk> years , my dear , ” he said after thinking for a little while , “ have passed since I received a letter from a lady living in <unk> , written with a stern passion and power that rendered it unlike all other letters I have ever read .
It was written to me ( as it told me in so many words ) , perhaps because it was the writer ’ s <unk> to put that trust in me , perhaps because it was mine to <unk> it .
It told me of a child , an orphan girl then twelve years old , in some such cruel words as those which live in your remembrance .
It told me that the writer had bred her in secrecy from her birth , had blotted out all trace of her existence , and that if the writer were to die before the child became a woman , she would be left entirely <unk> , <unk> , and unknown .
It asked me to consider if I would , in that case , finish what the writer had begun . ” I listened in silence and looked attentively at him .
“ Your early recollection , my dear , will <unk> the gloomy medium through which all this was seen and expressed by the writer , and the <unk> <unk> which <unk> her mind with impressions of the need there was for the child to <unk> an offence of which she was quite innocent .
I felt concerned for the little creature , in her darkened life , and replied to the letter . ” I took his hand and kissed it .
“ It laid the <unk> on me that I should never propose to see the writer , who had long been <unk> from all <unk> with the world , but who would see a confidential agent if I would <unk> one .
I <unk> Mr. Kenge .
The lady said , of her own <unk> and not of his seeking , that her name was an assumed one .
That she was , if there were any <unk> of blood in such a case , the child ’ s aunt .
That more than this she would never ( and he was well persuaded of the <unk> of her resolution ) for any human consideration <unk> .
My dear , I have told you all . ” I held his hand for a little while in mine .
“ I saw my ward oftener than she saw me , ” he added , <unk> making light of it , “ and I always knew she was beloved , useful , and happy .
She <unk> me <unk> , and twenty more to that , every hour in every day ! ” “ And oftener still , ” said I , “ she <unk> the guardian who is a father to her ! ” At the word father , I saw his former trouble come into his face .
He subdued it as before , and it was gone in an instant ; but it had been there and it had come so swiftly upon my words that I felt as if they had given him a shock .
I again <unk> repeated , wondering , “ That I could readily understand .
None that I could readily understand ! ” No , it was true .
I did not understand it .
Not for many and many a day .
“ Take a fatherly good night , my dear , ” said he , kissing me on the forehead , “ and so to rest .
These are late hours for working and thinking .
You do that for all of us , all day long , little housekeeper ! ” I neither worked nor thought any more that night .
I opened my grateful heart to heaven in <unk> for its <unk> to me and its care of me , and fell asleep .
We had a visitor next day .
Mr. Allan Woodcourt came .
He came to take leave of us ; he had settled to do so beforehand .
He was going to China and to India as a surgeon on board ship .
He was to be away a long , long time .
I believe — at least I know — that he was not rich .
All his <unk> mother could spare had been spent in <unk> him for his profession .
It was not <unk> to a young practitioner , with very little influence in London ; and although he was , night and day , at the service of <unk> of poor people and did wonders of gentleness and skill for them , he gained very little by it in money .
He was seven years older than I.
Not that I need mention it , for it hardly seems to belong to anything .
I think — I mean , he told us — that he had been in practice three or four years and that if he could have hoped to <unk> through three or four more , he would not have made the voyage on which he was bound .
But he had no fortune or private means , and so he was going away .
He had been to see us several times altogether .
We thought it a pity he should go away .
Because he was distinguished in his art among those who knew it best , and some of the greatest men belonging to it had a high opinion of him .
When he came to <unk> us good-bye , he brought his mother with him for the first time .
She was a pretty old lady , with bright black eyes , but she seemed proud .
She came from <unk> and had had , a long time ago , an eminent person for an <unk> , of the name of Morgan ap-Kerrig — of some place that sounded like <unk> — who was the most illustrious person that ever was known and all of whose relations were a sort of <unk> family .
He appeared to have passed his life in always getting up into mountains and <unk> somebody ; and a <unk> whose name sounded like <unk> had <unk> his <unk> in a piece which was called , as nearly as I could catch it , <unk> .
Mrs. Woodcourt , after <unk> to us on the <unk> of her great kinsman , said that no doubt wherever her son Allan went he would remember his <unk> and would on no account form an <unk> below it .
She told him that there were many handsome English ladies in India who went out on speculation , and that there were some to be picked up with property , but that neither charms nor wealth would <unk> for the <unk> from such a line without birth , which must ever be the first consideration .
She talked so much about birth that for a moment I half fancied , and with pain — But what an idle fancy to suppose that she could think or care what <unk> was !
Mr. Woodcourt seemed a little distressed by her <unk> , but he was too considerate to let her see it and <unk> delicately to bring the conversation round to making his <unk> to my guardian for his <unk> and for the very happy hours — he called them the very happy hours — he had passed with us .
The recollection of them , he said , would go with him wherever he went and would be always <unk> .
And so we gave him our hands , one after another — at least , they did — and I did ; and so he put his lips to Ada ’ s hand — and to mine ; and so he went away upon his long , long voyage !
I was very busy indeed all day and wrote directions home to the servants , and wrote notes for my guardian , and <unk> his books and papers , and <unk> my housekeeping keys a good deal , one way and another .
I was still busy between the lights , singing and working by the window , when who should come in but Caddy , whom I had no expectation of seeing !
“ Why , Caddy , my dear , ” said I , “ what beautiful flowers ! ” She had such an <unk> little nosegay in her hand .
“ Indeed , I think so , Esther , ” replied Caddy .
“ They are the <unk> I ever saw . ” “ Prince , my dear ? ” said I in a whisper .
“ No , ” answered Caddy , shaking her head and holding them to me to smell .
“ Not Prince . ” “ Well , to be sure , Caddy ! ” said I.
“ You must have two <unk> ! ” “ What ?
Do they look like that sort of thing ? ” said Caddy .
“ Do they look like that sort of thing ? ” I repeated , pinching her cheek .
Caddy only laughed in return , and telling me that she had come for half an hour , at the <unk> of which time Prince would be waiting for her at the corner , sat <unk> with me and Ada in the window , every now and then <unk> me the flowers again or trying how they looked against my hair .
At last , when she was going , she took me into my room and put them in my dress .
“ For me ? ” said I , surprised .
“ For you , ” said Caddy with a kiss .
“ They were left behind by somebody . ” “ <unk> behind ? ” “ At poor Miss Flite ’ s , ” said Caddy .
“ Somebody who has been very good to her was <unk> away an hour ago to join a ship and left these flowers behind .
No , no !
Don ’ t take them out .
Let the pretty little things lie here , ” said Caddy , adjusting them with a careful hand , “ because I was present myself , and I shouldn ’ t wonder if somebody left them on purpose ! ” “ Do they look like that sort of thing ? ” said Ada , coming laughingly behind me and <unk> me <unk> round the waist .
“ Oh , yes , indeed they do , Dame Durden !
They look very , very like that sort of thing .
Oh , very like it indeed , my dear ! ” CHAPTER <unk> Lady Dedlock It was not so easy as it had appeared at first to arrange for Richard ’ s making a trial of Mr. Kenge ’ s office .
Richard himself was the chief <unk> .
As soon as he had it in his power to leave Mr. Badger at any moment , he began to doubt whether he wanted to leave him at all .
He didn ’ t know , he said , really .
It wasn ’ t a bad profession ; he couldn ’ t <unk> that he <unk> it ; perhaps he liked it as well as he liked any other — suppose he gave it one more chance !
Upon that , he shut himself up for a few weeks with some books and some bones and seemed to <unk> a considerable <unk> of information with great <unk> .
His <unk> , after <unk> about a month , began to cool , and when it was quite <unk> , began to grow warm again .
His <unk> between law and medicine lasted so long that <unk> arrived before he finally separated from Mr. Badger and entered on an <unk> course of Messrs. Kenge and Carboy .
For all his <unk> , he took great credit to himself as being determined to be in earnest “ this time . ” And he was so <unk> throughout , and in such high spirits , and so fond of Ada , that it was very difficult indeed to be otherwise than pleased with him .
“ As to Mr. Jarndyce , ” who , I may mention , found the wind much given , during this period , to stick in the east ; “ As to Mr. Jarndyce , ” Richard would say to me , “ he is the <unk> fellow in the world , Esther !
I must be particularly careful , if it were only for his satisfaction , to take myself well to task and have a regular <unk> of this business now . ” The idea of his taking himself well to task , with that laughing face and <unk> manner and with a fancy that everything could catch and nothing could hold , was <unk> <unk> .
However , he told us <unk> that he was doing it to such an extent that he wondered his hair didn ’ t turn grey .
His regular <unk> of the business was ( as I have said ) that he went to Mr. Kenge ’ s about <unk> to try how he liked it .
All this time he was , in money affairs , what I have described him in a former <unk> — generous , <unk> , <unk> careless , but fully persuaded that he was rather <unk> and prudent .
I happened to say to Ada , in his presence , half <unk> , half seriously , about the time of his going to Mr. Kenge ’ s , that he needed to have <unk> ’ purse , he made so light of money , which he answered in this way , “ My jewel of a dear cousin , you hear this old woman !
Why does she say that ?
Because I gave eight pounds odd ( or whatever it was ) for a certain neat waistcoat and buttons a few days ago .
Now , if I had stayed at Badger ’ s I should have been obliged to spend twelve pounds at a blow for some <unk> <unk> .
So I make four pounds — in a <unk> — by the transaction ! ” It was a question much discussed between him and my guardian what arrangements should be made for his living in London while he <unk> on the law , for we had long since gone back to Bleak House , and it was too far off to admit of his coming there oftener than once a week .
My guardian told me that if Richard were to settle down at Mr. Kenge ’ s he would take some <unk> or chambers where we too could occasionally stay for a few days at a time ; “ but , little woman , ” he added , rubbing his head very <unk> , “ he hasn ’ t settled down there yet ! ” The <unk> ended in our <unk> for him , by the month , a neat little furnished lodging in a quiet old house near <unk> Square .
He immediately began to spend all the money he had in buying the <unk> little ornaments and <unk> for this lodging ; and so often as Ada and I <unk> him from making any <unk> that he had in contemplation which was particularly unnecessary and expensive , he took credit for what it would have cost and made out that to spend anything less on something else was to save the difference .
While these affairs were in <unk> , our visit to Mr. Boythorn ’ s was <unk> .
At length , Richard having taken possession of his lodging , there was nothing to prevent our departure .
He could have gone with us at that time of the year very well , but he was in the full novelty of his new position and was making most <unk> <unk> to <unk> the mysteries of the fatal suit .
Consequently we went without him , and my darling was delighted to praise him for being so busy .
We made a pleasant journey down into Lincolnshire by the coach and had an <unk> companion in Mr. Skimpole .
His furniture had been all cleared off , it appeared , by the person who took possession of it on his blue-eyed daughter ’ s birthday , but he seemed quite relieved to think that it was gone .
<unk> and table , he said , were <unk> objects ; they were monotonous ideas , they had no variety of expression , they looked you out of countenance , and you looked them out of countenance .
How pleasant , then , to be bound to no particular chairs and tables , but to <unk> like a <unk> among all the furniture on <unk> , and to <unk> from <unk> to <unk> , and from <unk> to <unk> , and from this shape to that , as the humour took one !
“ The <unk> of the thing is , ” said Mr. Skimpole with a quickened sense of the <unk> , “ that my chairs and tables were not paid for , and yet my landlord walks off with them as composedly as possible .
Now , that seems droll !
There is something <unk> in it .
The chair and table <unk> never engaged to pay my landlord my rent .
Why should my landlord quarrel with HIM ?
If I have a <unk> on my nose which is disagreeable to my landlord ’ s peculiar ideas of beauty , my landlord has no business to scratch my chair and table <unk> ’ s nose , which has no <unk> on it .
His <unk> seems defective ! ” “ Well , ” said my guardian good-humouredly , “ it ’ s pretty clear that <unk> became security for those chairs and tables will have to pay for them . ” “ <unk> ! ” returned Mr. Skimpole .
“ That ’ s the <unk> point of <unk> in the business !
I said to my landlord , ‘ My good man , you are not aware that my excellent friend Jarndyce will have to pay for those things that you are sweeping off in that <unk> manner .
Have you no consideration for HIS property ? ’ He hadn ’ t the least . ” “ And refused all proposals , ” said my guardian .
“ <unk> all proposals , ” returned Mr. Skimpole .
“ I made him business proposals .
I had him into my room .
I said , ‘ You are a man of business , I believe ? ’ He replied , ‘ I am . ’ ‘ Very well , ’ said I , ‘ now let us be business-like .
Here is an inkstand , here are pens and paper , here are <unk> .
What do you want ?
I have occupied your house for a considerable period , I believe to our mutual satisfaction until this unpleasant <unk> arose ; let us be at once friendly and business-like .
What do you want ? ’ In reply to this , he made use of the <unk> expression — which has something <unk> about it — that he had never seen the colour of my money .
‘ My amiable friend , ’ said I , ‘ I never have any money .
I never know anything about money . ’ ‘ Well , sir , ’ said he , ‘ what do you offer if I give you time ? ’ ‘ My good fellow , ’ said I , ‘ I have no idea of time ; but you say you are a man of business , and whatever you can <unk> to be done in a business-like way with pen , and ink , and paper — and <unk> — I am ready to do .
Don ’ t pay yourself at another man ’ s expense ( which is foolish ) , but be business-like ! ’ However , he wouldn ’ t be , and there was an end of it . ” If these were some of the <unk> of Mr. Skimpole ’ s childhood , it assuredly possessed its advantages too .
On the journey he had a very good appetite for such refreshment as came in our way ( including a basket of choice <unk> <unk> ) , but never thought of paying for anything .
So when the <unk> came round for his fee , he pleasantly asked him what he considered a very good fee indeed , now — a <unk> one — and on his replying half a crown for a single <unk> , said it was little enough too , all things considered , and left Mr. Jarndyce to give it him .
It was delightful weather .
The green <unk> <unk> so <unk> , the <unk> <unk> so <unk> , the <unk> were so full of wild flowers , the trees were so <unk> out in leaf , the <unk> , with a light wind blowing over them , filled the air with such a delicious <unk> !
<unk> in the afternoon we came to the <unk> where we were to <unk> from the coach — a dull little town with a <unk> , and a <unk> , and a <unk> , and one <unk> sunny street , and a <unk> with an old horse <unk> his legs in it , and a very few men <unk> lying and standing about in narrow little bits of shade .
After the rustling of the leaves and the waving of the <unk> all along the road , it looked as still , as hot , as motionless a little town as England could produce .
At the inn we found Mr. Boythorn on <unk> , waiting with an open carriage to take us to his house , which was a few miles off .
He was <unk> to see us and <unk> with great <unk> .
“ By heaven ! ” said he after giving us a <unk> <unk> .
“ This a most <unk> coach .
It is the most <unk> example of an <unk> public <unk> that ever <unk> the face of the earth .
It is <unk> minutes after its time this afternoon .
The <unk> ought to be put to death ! ” “ IS he after his time ? ” said Mr. Skimpole , to whom he happened to address himself .
“ You know my <unk> . ” “ <unk> minutes !
<unk> minutes ! ” replied Mr. Boythorn , referring to his watch .
“ With two ladies in the coach , this <unk> has deliberately <unk> his arrival six and twenty minutes .
<unk> !
It is impossible that it can be accidental !
But his father — and his uncle — were the most <unk> <unk> that ever sat upon a box . ” While he said this in tones of the greatest indignation , he handed us into the little <unk> with the utmost gentleness and was all smiles and pleasure .
“ I am sorry , ladies , ” he said , standing <unk> at the <unk> when all was ready , “ that I am obliged to conduct you nearly two miles out of the way .
But our direct road lies through Sir Leicester Dedlock ’ s park , and in that fellow ’ s property I have <unk> never to set foot of mine , or horse ’ s foot of mine , <unk> the present relations between us , while I breathe the breath of life ! ” And here , catching my guardian ’ s eye , he broke into one of his tremendous laughs , which seemed to shake even the motionless little <unk> .
“ Are the Dedlocks down here , Lawrence ? ” said my guardian as we drove along and Mr. Boythorn <unk> on the green turf by the <unk> .
“ Sir <unk> <unk> is here , ” replied Mr. Boythorn .
“ Ha ha ha !
Sir <unk> is here , and I am glad to say , has been laid by the heels here .
My Lady , ” in <unk> whom he always made a courtly gesture as if particularly to <unk> her from any part in the quarrel , “ is expected , I believe , daily .
I am not in the least surprised that she <unk> her appearance as long as possible .
Whatever can have induced that <unk> woman to marry that <unk> and <unk> of a baronet is one of the most <unk> mysteries that ever <unk> human inquiry .
Ha ha ha ha ! ” “ I suppose , ” said my guardian , laughing , “ <unk> may set foot in the park while we are here ?
The <unk> does not extend to us , does it ? ” “ I can lay no <unk> on my guests , ” he said , bending his head to Ada and me with the smiling politeness which sat so <unk> upon him , “ except in the matter of their departure .
I am only sorry that I cannot have the happiness of being their escort about Chesney Wold , which is a very fine place !
But by the light of this summer day , Jarndyce , if you call upon the owner while you stay with me , you are likely to have but a cool reception .
He carries himself like an <unk> clock at all times , like one of a race of <unk> clocks in <unk> cases that never go and never went — Ha ha ha ! — but he will have some extra <unk> , I can promise you , for the friends of his friend and <unk> Boythorn ! ” “ I shall not put him to the proof , ” said my guardian .
“ He is as indifferent to the honour of knowing me , I dare say , as I am to the honour of knowing him .
The air of the grounds and perhaps such a view of the house as any other <unk> might get are quite enough for me . ” “ Well ! ” said Mr. Boythorn .
“ I am glad of it on the whole .
It ’ s in better keeping .
I am looked upon about here as a second <unk> <unk> the lightning .
Ha ha ha ha !
When I go into our little church on a Sunday , a considerable part of the <unk> congregation expect to see me drop , <unk> and withered , on the pavement under the Dedlock displeasure .
Ha ha ha ha !
I have no doubt he is surprised that I don ’ t .
For he is , by heaven , the most <unk> , and the <unk> , and the most <unk> and utterly <unk> <unk> ! ” Our coming to the <unk> of a hill we had been <unk> <unk> our friend to point out Chesney Wold itself to us and <unk> his attention from its master .
It was a <unk> old house in a fine park <unk> <unk> .
Among the trees and not far from the residence he pointed out the <unk> of the little church of which he had spoken .
Oh , the solemn woods over which the light and shadow <unk> swiftly , as if <unk> wings were sweeping on benignant <unk> through the summer air ; the smooth green <unk> , the glittering water , the garden where the flowers were so <unk> arranged in <unk> of the <unk> colours , how beautiful they looked !
The house , with <unk> and chimney , and tower , and <unk> , and dark doorway , and broad <unk> , <unk> among the <unk> of which , and lying <unk> upon the <unk> , there was one great flush of roses , seemed scarcely real in its light <unk> and in the serene and peaceful <unk> that rested on all around it .
To Ada and to me , that above all appeared the <unk> influence .
On everything , house , garden , terrace , green <unk> , water , old <unk> , fern , moss , woods again , and far away across the <unk> in the prospect to the distance lying wide before us with a <unk> bloom upon it , there seemed to be such <unk> repose .
When we came into the little village and passed a small inn with the sign of the Dedlock Arms swinging over the road in front , Mr. Boythorn <unk> <unk> with a young gentleman sitting on a bench outside the <unk> who had some <unk> lying beside him .
“ That ’ s the housekeeper ’ s grandson , Mr. Rouncewell by name , ” said , he , “ and he is in love with a pretty girl up at the house .
Lady Dedlock has taken a fancy to the pretty girl and is going to keep her about her own fair person — an honour which my young friend himself does not at all <unk> .
However , he can ’ t marry just yet , even if his <unk> were willing ; so he is <unk> to make the best of it .
In the meanwhile , he comes here pretty often for a day or two at a time to — fish .
Ha ha ha ha ! ” “ Are he and the pretty girl engaged , Mr. Boythorn ? ” asked Ada .
“ Why , my dear Miss Clare , ” he returned , “ I think they may perhaps understand each other ; but you will see them soon , I dare say , and I must learn from you on such a point — not you from me . ” Ada <unk> , and Mr. Boythorn , <unk> forward on his <unk> grey horse , <unk> at his own door and stood ready with extended arm and <unk> head to welcome us when we arrived .
He lived in a pretty house , formerly the <unk> house , with a <unk> in front , a bright flower-garden at the side , and a <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> , enclosed with a venerable wall that had of itself a <unk> <unk> look .
But , indeed , everything about the place wore an aspect of <unk> and <unk> .
The old <unk> walk was like green <unk> , the very shadows of the <unk> and <unk> were heavy with fruit , the <unk> were so <unk> that their branches arched and rested on the earth , the <unk> and <unk> grew in like <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> by the hundred on the wall .
<unk> about among the spread <unk> and the glass <unk> sparkling and winking in the sun there were such heaps of drooping <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , that every foot of ground appeared a <unk> <unk> , while the smell of sweet <unk> and all kinds of wholesome growth ( to say nothing of the neighbouring <unk> where the <unk> was carrying ) made the whole air a great nosegay .
Such stillness and composure <unk> within the orderly <unk> of the old red wall that even the feathers hung in <unk> to <unk> the birds hardly stirred ; and the wall had such a <unk> influence that where , here and there high up , a <unk> <unk> and scrap of list still clung to it , it was easy to fancy that they had <unk> with the changing seasons and that they had <unk> and <unk> according to the common fate .
The house , though a little <unk> in comparison with the garden , was a real old house with <unk> in the chimney of the <unk> kitchen and great <unk> across the <unk> .
On one side of it was the terrible piece of ground in dispute , where Mr. Boythorn maintained a <unk> in a <unk> day and night , whose duty was supposed to be , in cases of <unk> , immediately to ring a large bell hung up there for the purpose , to <unk> a great <unk> established in a <unk> as his <unk> , and generally to deal <unk> on the enemy .
Not content with these precautions , Mr. Boythorn had himself composed and posted there , on painted <unk> to which his name was attached in large letters , the following solemn <unk> : “ <unk> of the <unk> .
He is most ferocious .
Lawrence Boythorn . ” “ The <unk> is <unk> with <unk> .
Lawrence Boythorn . ” “ <unk> and <unk> are set here at all times of the day and night .
Lawrence Boythorn . ” “ Take notice .
That any person or persons <unk> <unk> to trespass on this property will be punished with the utmost severity of private <unk> and <unk> with the utmost <unk> of the law .
Lawrence Boythorn . ” These he showed us from the drawing-room window , while his bird was hopping about his head , and he laughed , “ Ha ha ha ha !
Ha ha ha ha ! ” to that extent as he pointed them out that I really thought he would have hurt himself .
“ But this is taking a good deal of trouble , ” said Mr. Skimpole in his light way , “ when you are not in earnest after all . ” “ Not in earnest ! ” returned Mr. Boythorn with unspeakable warmth .
“ Not in earnest !
If I could have hoped to train him , I would have bought a <unk> instead of that dog and would have turned him loose upon the first intolerable <unk> who should dare to make an <unk> on my rights .
Let Sir Leicester Dedlock consent to come out and decide this question by single <unk> , and I will meet him with any <unk> known to mankind in any age or country .
I am that much in earnest .
Not more ! ” We arrived at his house on a Saturday .
On the Sunday morning we all set forth to walk to the little church in the park .
<unk> the park , almost immediately by the disputed ground , we pursued a pleasant <unk> winding among the <unk> turf and the beautiful trees until it brought us to the <unk> .
The congregation was extremely small and quite a rustic one with the <unk> of a large <unk> of servants from the house , some of whom were already in their seats , while others were yet <unk> in .
There were some stately <unk> , and there was a perfect picture of an old <unk> , who looked as if he were the official representative of all the <unk> and <unk> that had ever been put into his coach .
There was a very pretty show of young women , and above them , the handsome old face and fine responsible <unk> figure of the housekeeper <unk> <unk> .
The pretty girl of whom Mr. Boythorn had told us was close by her .
She was so very pretty that I might have known her by her beauty even if I had not seen how <unk> conscious she was of the eyes of the young <unk> , whom I discovered not far off .
One face , and not an agreeable one , though it was handsome , seemed <unk> watchful of this pretty girl , and indeed of every one and everything there .
It was a Frenchwoman ’ s .
As the bell was yet ringing and the great people were not yet come , I had leisure to glance over the church , which <unk> as <unk> as a grave , and to think what a shady , ancient , solemn little church it was .
The windows , heavily shaded by trees , admitted a subdued light that made the faces around me pale , and darkened the old <unk> in the pavement and the time and <unk> <unk> , and rendered the sunshine in the little porch , where a monotonous <unk> was working at the bell , <unk> bright .
But a stir in that direction , a <unk> of <unk> awe in the rustic faces , and a <unk> ferocious <unk> on the part of Mr. Boythorn of being <unk> unconscious of somebody ’ s existence <unk> me that the great people were come and that the service was going to begin .
“ ‘ <unk> not into judgment with thy servant , O Lord , for in thy sight — ’ ” Shall I ever forget the rapid beating at my heart , <unk> by the look I met as I stood up !
Shall I ever forget the manner in which those handsome proud eyes seemed to spring out of their <unk> and to hold mine !
It was only a moment before I cast mine down — released again , if I may say so — on my book ; but I knew the beautiful face quite well in that short space of time .
And , very strangely , there was something quickened within me , associated with the lonely days at my godmother ’ s ; yes , away even to the days when I had stood on <unk> to dress myself at my little glass after <unk> my doll .
And this , although I had never seen this lady ’ s face before in all my life — I was quite sure of it — absolutely certain .
It was easy to know that the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> gentleman , the only other <unk> of the great pew , was Sir Leicester Dedlock , and that the lady was Lady Dedlock .
But why her face should be , in a confused way , like a broken glass to me , in which I saw scraps of old remembrances , and why I should be so fluttered and troubled ( for I was still ) by having casually met her eyes , I could not think .
I felt it to be an <unk> weakness in me and tried to overcome it by attending to the words I heard .
Then , very strangely , I seemed to hear them , not in the <unk> ’ s voice , but in the <unk> voice of my godmother .
This made me think , did Lady Dedlock ’ s face accidentally <unk> my godmother ’ s ?
It might be that it did , a little ; but the expression was so different , and the stern decision which had worn into my godmother ’ s face , like weather into <unk> , was so completely wanting in the face before me that it could not be that <unk> which had struck me .
Neither did I know the <unk> and <unk> of Lady Dedlock ’ s face , at all , in any one .
And yet I — I , little Esther Summerson , the child who lived a life apart and on whose birthday there was no <unk> — seemed to arise before my own eyes , <unk> out of the past by some power in this fashionable lady , whom I not only entertained no fancy that I had ever seen , but whom I perfectly well knew I had never seen until that hour .
It made me tremble so to be thrown into this unaccountable agitation that I was conscious of being distressed even by the observation of the French maid , though I knew she had been looking <unk> here , and there , and everywhere , from the moment of her coming into the church .
By degrees , though very slowly , I at last <unk> my strange emotion .
After a long time , I looked towards Lady Dedlock again .
It was while they were preparing to sing , before the <unk> .
She took no <unk> of me , and the beating at my heart was gone .
Neither did it <unk> for more than a few moments when she once or twice afterwards glanced at Ada or at me through her glass .
The service being concluded , Sir Leicester gave his arm with much taste and gallantry to Lady Dedlock — though he was obliged to walk by the help of a thick stick — and <unk> her out of church to the pony carriage in which they had come .
The servants then dispersed , and so did the congregation , whom Sir Leicester had contemplated all along ( Mr. Skimpole said to Mr. Boythorn ’ s infinite delight ) as if he were a considerable <unk> <unk> in heaven .
“ He believes he is ! ” said Mr. Boythorn .
“ He <unk> believes it .
So did his father , and his grandfather , and his <unk> ! ” “ Do you know , ” pursued Mr. Skimpole very unexpectedly to Mr. Boythorn , “ it ’ s agreeable to me to see a man of that sort . ” “ IS it ! ” said Mr. Boythorn .
“ Say that he wants to <unk> me , ” pursued Mr. Skimpole .
“ Very well !
I don ’ t object . ” “ I do , ” said Mr. Boythorn with great <unk> .
“ Do you really ? ” returned Mr. Skimpole in his easy light <unk> .
“ But that ’ s taking trouble , surely .
And why should you take trouble ?
Here am I , content to receive things <unk> as they fall out , and I never take trouble !
I come down here , for instance , and I find a mighty <unk> <unk> homage .
Very well !
I say ‘ <unk> <unk> , here IS my homage !
It ’ s easier to give it than to <unk> it .
Here it is .
If you have anything of an agreeable nature to show me , I shall be happy to see it ; if you have anything of an agreeable nature to give me , I shall be happy to accept it . ’ <unk> <unk> replies in effect , ‘ This is a sensible fellow .
I find him <unk> with my digestion and my <unk> system .
He <unk> ’ t <unk> upon me the necessity of rolling myself up like a <unk> with my points outward .
I <unk> , I open , I turn my silver <unk> outward like <unk> ’ s cloud , and it ’ s more agreeable to both of us . ’ That ’ s my view of such things , speaking as a child ! ” “ But suppose you went down somewhere else to-morrow , ” said Mr. Boythorn , “ where there was the opposite of that fellow — or of this fellow .
How then ? ” “ How then ? ” said Mr. Skimpole with an appearance of the utmost simplicity and candour .
“ Just the same then !
I should say , ‘ My esteemed Boythorn ’ — to make you the <unk> of our imaginary friend — ‘ my esteemed Boythorn , you object to the mighty <unk> ?
Very good .
So do I. I take it that my business in the social system is to be agreeable ; I take it that everybody ’ s business in the social system is to be agreeable .
It ’ s a system of <unk> , in short .
Therefore if you object , I object .
Now , excellent Boythorn , let us go to dinner ! ’ ” “ But excellent Boythorn might say , ” returned our host , <unk> and growing very red , “ I ’ ll be — ” “ I understand , ” said Mr. Skimpole .
“ Very likely he would . ” “ — if I WILL go to dinner ! ” cried Mr. Boythorn in a violent burst and stopping to strike his stick upon the ground .
“ And he would probably add , ‘ Is there such a thing as principle , Mr. Harold Skimpole ? ’ ” “ To which Harold Skimpole would reply , you know , ” he returned in his <unk> manner and with his most ingenuous smile , “ ‘ Upon my life I have not the least idea !
I don ’ t know what it is you call by that name , or where it is , or who <unk> it .
If you possess it and find it comfortable , I am quite delighted and <unk> you heartily .
But I know nothing about it , I assure you ; for I am a mere child , and I lay no claim to it , and I don ’ t want it ! ’ So , you see , excellent Boythorn and I would go to dinner after all ! ” This was one of many little <unk> between them which I always expected to end , and which I dare say would have ended under other circumstances , in some violent <unk> on the part of our host .
But he had so high a sense of his hospitable and responsible position as our <unk> , and my guardian laughed so sincerely at and with Mr. Skimpole , as a child who blew <unk> and broke them all day long , that matters never went beyond this point .
Mr. Skimpole , who always seemed quite unconscious of having been on delicate ground , then <unk> himself to beginning some <unk> in the park which he never finished , or to playing fragments of <unk> on the piano , or to singing scraps of songs , or to lying down on his back under a tree and looking at the sky — which he couldn ’ t help thinking , he said , was what he was meant for ; it suited him so exactly .
“ <unk> and effort , ” he would say to us ( on his back ) , “ are delightful to me .
I believe I am truly <unk> .
I have the deepest sympathy with them .
I lie in a shady place like this and think of <unk> spirits going to the North <unk> or <unk> to the heart of the <unk> <unk> with admiration .
<unk> creatures ask , ‘ What is the use of a man ’ s going to the North <unk> ?
What good does it do ? ’ I can ’ t say ; but , for anything I CAN say , he may go for the purpose — though he don ’ t know it — of <unk> my thoughts as I lie here .
Take an extreme case .
Take the case of the <unk> on <unk> <unk> .
I dare say they are worked hard , I dare say they don ’ t altogether like it .
I dare say <unk> is an unpleasant experience on the whole ; but they people the landscape for me , they give it a poetry for me , and perhaps that is one of the pleasanter objects of their existence .
I am very sensible of it , if it be , and I shouldn ’ t wonder if it were ! ” I always wondered on these occasions whether he ever thought of Mrs. Skimpole and the children , and in what point of view they presented themselves to his <unk> mind .
So far as I could understand , they rarely presented themselves at all .
The week had gone round to the Saturday following that beating of my heart in the church ; and every day had been so bright and blue that to <unk> in the woods , and to see the light striking down among the <unk> leaves and sparkling in the beautiful <unk> of the shadows of the trees , while the birds poured out their songs and the air was drowsy with the hum of <unk> , had been most delightful .
We had one favourite spot , deep in moss and last year ’ s leaves , where there were some <unk> trees from which the bark was all <unk> off .
<unk> among these , we looked through a green <unk> supported by thousands of natural <unk> , the whitened <unk> of trees , upon a distant prospect made so radiant by its contrast with the shade in which we sat and made so precious by the arched perspective through which we saw it that it was like a glimpse of the better land .
Upon the Saturday we sat here , Mr. Jarndyce , Ada , and I , until we heard <unk> muttering in the distance and felt the large <unk> rattle through the leaves .
The weather had been all the week extremely <unk> , but the storm broke so suddenly — upon us , at least , in that <unk> spot — that before we reached the <unk> of the wood the <unk> and lightning were frequent and the rain came plunging through the leaves as if every drop were a great leaden <unk> .
As it was not a time for standing among trees , we ran out of the wood , and up and down the <unk> steps which crossed the <unk> like two <unk> <unk> placed back to back , and made for a keeper ’ s lodge which was close at hand .
We had often noticed the dark beauty of this lodge standing in a deep twilight of trees , and how the ivy <unk> over it , and how there was a <unk> hollow near , where we had once seen the keeper ’ s dog <unk> down into the fern as if it were water .
The lodge was so dark within , now the sky was <unk> , that we only clearly saw the man who came to the door when we took shelter there and put two chairs for Ada and me .
The <unk> were all thrown open , and we sat just within the doorway watching the storm .
It was grand to see how the wind awoke , and bent the trees , and drove the rain before it like a cloud of smoke ; and to hear the solemn <unk> and to see the lightning ; and while thinking with awe of the tremendous <unk> by which our little lives are <unk> , to consider how <unk> they are and how upon the <unk> flower and leaf there was already a <unk> poured from all this seeming rage which seemed to make <unk> new again .
“ Is it not dangerous to sit in so exposed a place ? ” “ Oh , no , Esther dear ! ” said Ada quietly .
Ada said it to me , but I had not spoken .
The beating of my heart came back again .
I had never heard the voice , as I had never seen the face , but it affected me in the same strange way .
Again , in a moment , there arose before my mind innumerable pictures of myself .
Lady Dedlock had taken shelter in the lodge before our arrival there and had come out of the gloom within .
She stood behind my chair with her hand upon it .
I saw her with her hand close to my shoulder when I turned my head .
“ I have frightened you ? ” she said .
No .
It was not fright .
Why should I be frightened !
“ I believe , ” said Lady Dedlock to my guardian , “ I have the pleasure of speaking to Mr. Jarndyce . ” “ Your remembrance does me more honour than I had supposed it would , Lady Dedlock , ” he returned .
“ I recognized you in church on Sunday .
I am sorry that any <unk> <unk> of Sir Leicester ’ s — they are not of his seeking , however , I believe — should render it a matter of some absurd difficulty to show you any attention here . ” “ I am aware of the circumstances , ” returned my guardian with a smile , “ and am sufficiently obliged . ” She had given him her hand in an indifferent way that seemed habitual to her and spoke in a <unk> indifferent manner , though in a very pleasant voice .
She was as graceful as she was beautiful , perfectly <unk> , and had the air , I thought , of being able to <unk> and interest any one if she had thought it worth her while .
The keeper had brought her a chair on which she sat in the middle of the porch between us .
“ Is the young gentleman disposed of whom you wrote to Sir Leicester about and whose wishes Sir Leicester was sorry not to have it in his power to advance in any way ? ” she said over her shoulder to my guardian .
“ I hope so , ” said he .
She seemed to respect him and even to wish to <unk> him .
There was something very <unk> in her haughty manner , and it became more familiar — I was going to say more easy , but that could hardly be — as she spoke to him over her shoulder .
“ I presume this is your other ward , Miss Clare ? ” He presented Ada , in form .
“ You will lose the disinterested part of your Don <unk> character , ” said Lady Dedlock to Mr. Jarndyce over her shoulder again , “ if you only <unk> the wrongs of beauty like this .
But present me , ” and she turned full upon me , “ to this young lady too ! ” “ Miss Summerson really is my ward , ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ I am responsible to no Lord Chancellor in her case . ” “ Has Miss Summerson lost both her parents ? ” said my Lady .
“ Yes . ” “ She is very fortunate in her guardian . ” Lady Dedlock looked at me , and I looked at her and said I was indeed .
All at once she turned from me with a hasty air , almost expressive of displeasure or <unk> , and spoke to him over her shoulder again .
“ <unk> have passed since we were in the habit of meeting , Mr. Jarndyce . ” “ A long time .
At least I thought it was a long time , until I saw you last Sunday , ” he returned .
“ What !
Even you are a <unk> , or think it necessary to become one to me ! ” she said with some <unk> .
“ I have <unk> that reputation , I suppose . ” “ You have <unk> so much , Lady Dedlock , ” said my guardian , “ that you pay some little <unk> , I dare say .
But none to me . ” “ So much ! ” she repeated , slightly laughing .
“ Yes ! ” With her air of <unk> , and power , and fascination , and I know not what , she seemed to regard Ada and me as little more than children .
So , as she slightly laughed and afterwards sat looking at the rain , she was as <unk> and as free to occupy herself with her own thoughts as if she had been alone .
“ I think you knew my sister when we were abroad together better than you know me ? ” she said , looking at him again .
“ Yes , we happened to meet oftener , ” he returned .
“ We went our several ways , ” said Lady Dedlock , “ and had little in common even before we agreed to <unk> .
It is to be regretted , I suppose , but it could not be helped . ” Lady Dedlock again sat looking at the rain .
The storm soon began to pass upon its way .
The shower greatly <unk> , the lightning ceased , the <unk> rolled among the distant hills , and the sun began to <unk> on the wet leaves and the falling rain .
As we sat there , silently , we saw a little pony <unk> coming towards us at a merry pace .
“ The messenger is coming back , my Lady , ” said the keeper , “ with the carriage . ” As it drove up , we saw that there were two people inside .
There alighted from it , with some <unk> and <unk> , first the Frenchwoman whom I had seen in church , and <unk> the pretty girl , the Frenchwoman with a <unk> confidence , the pretty girl confused and hesitating .
“ What now ? ” said Lady Dedlock .
“ Two ! ” “ I am your maid , my Lady , at the present , ” said the Frenchwoman .
“ The message was for the attendant . ” “ I was afraid you might mean me , my Lady , ” said the pretty girl .
“ I did mean you , child , ” replied her mistress calmly .
“ Put that shawl on me . ” She slightly stooped her shoulders to receive it , and the pretty girl lightly dropped it in its place .
The Frenchwoman stood <unk> , looking on with her lips very tightly set .
“ I am sorry , ” said Lady Dedlock to Mr. Jarndyce , “ that we are not likely to renew our former acquaintance .
You will allow me to send the carriage back for your two wards .
It shall be here directly . ” But as he would on no account accept this offer , she took a graceful leave of Ada — none of me — and put her hand upon his <unk> arm , and got into the carriage , which was a little , low , park carriage with a <unk> .
“ Come in , child , ” she said to the pretty girl ; “ I shall want you .
Go on ! ” The carriage rolled away , and the Frenchwoman , with the <unk> she had brought hanging over her arm , remained standing where she had alighted .
I suppose there is nothing pride can so little bear with as pride itself , and that she was punished for her <unk> manner .
Her <unk> was the most singular I could have <unk> .
She remained perfectly still until the carriage had turned into the drive , and then , without the least <unk> of countenance , slipped off her shoes , left them on the ground , and walked deliberately in the same direction through the <unk> of the wet grass .
“ Is that young woman mad ? ” said my guardian .
“ Oh , no , sir ! ” said the keeper , who , with his wife , was looking after her .
“ Hortense is not one of that sort .
She has as good a <unk> as the best .
But she ’ s mortal high and passionate — powerful high and passionate ; and what with having notice to leave , and having others put above her , she don ’ t take kindly to it . ” “ But why should she walk <unk> through all that water ? ” said my guardian .
“ Why , indeed , sir , unless it is to cool her down ! ” said the man .
“ Or unless she <unk> it ’ s blood , ” said the woman .
“ She ’ d as soon walk through that as anything else , I think , when her own ’ s up ! ” We passed not far from the house a few minutes afterwards .
<unk> as it had looked when we first saw it , it looked even more so now , with a <unk> <unk> glittering all about it , a light wind blowing , the birds no longer hushed but singing strongly , everything refreshed by the late rain , and the little carriage shining at the doorway like a fairy carriage made of silver .
Still , very <unk> and quietly walking towards it , a peaceful figure too in the landscape , went Mademoiselle Hortense , <unk> , through the wet grass .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> On It is the long vacation in the regions of Chancery Lane .
The good ships <unk> and Equity , those <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and not by any means <unk> <unk> are laid up in ordinary .
The <unk> <unk> , with a <unk> of ghostly clients imploring all whom they may encounter to <unk> their papers , has <unk> , for the time being , heaven knows where .
The courts are all shut up ; the public offices lie in a hot sleep .
Westminster Hall itself is a shady <unk> where <unk> might sing , and a <unk> class of suitors than is usually found there , walk .
The Temple , Chancery Lane , <unk> ’ Inn , and Lincoln ’ s Inn even unto the Fields are like <unk> <unk> at low water , where <unk> proceedings , offices at <unk> , idle clerks <unk> on <unk> <unk> that will not recover their <unk> until the <unk> of <unk> sets in , lie high and dry upon the <unk> of the long vacation .
<unk> doors of chambers are shut up by the score , <unk> and <unk> are to be left at the <unk> ’ s <unk> by the <unk> .
A <unk> of grass would grow in the <unk> of the stone pavement outside Lincoln ’ s Inn Hall , but that the <unk> , who have nothing to do beyond sitting in the shade there , with their white <unk> over their heads to keep the flies off , <unk> it up and eat it thoughtfully .
There is only one judge in town .
Even he only comes twice a week to sit in chambers .
If the country <unk> of those <unk> <unk> on his <unk> could see him now !
No <unk> wig , no red <unk> , no fur , no <unk> , no white <unk> .
<unk> a <unk> gentleman in white <unk> and a white hat , with <unk> on the <unk> countenance , and a <unk> of bark <unk> by the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> nose , who calls in at the <unk> shop as he comes along and drinks <unk> <unk> !
The bar of England is scattered over the face of the earth .
How England can get on through four long summer months without its bar — which is its acknowledged refuge in <unk> and its only <unk> triumph in <unk> — is beside the question ; assuredly that <unk> and <unk> of <unk> are not in present wear .
The learned gentleman who is always so <unk> indignant at the <unk> <unk> committed on the feelings of his client by the opposite party that he never seems likely to recover it is doing infinitely better than might be expected in <unk> .
The learned gentleman who does the <unk> business and who <unk> all <unk> with his gloomy <unk> is as merry as a <unk> at a French <unk> .
The learned gentleman who <unk> by the pint on the <unk> <unk> has not shed a tear these six weeks .
The very learned gentleman who has <unk> the natural heat of his <unk> complexion in <unk> and <unk> of law until he has become great in <unk> <unk> for <unk> , when he <unk> the drowsy bench with legal “ <unk> , ” <unk> to the <unk> and to most of the <unk> too , is <unk> , with a <unk> delight in <unk> and dust , about <unk> .
Other dispersed fragments of the same great <unk> are to be found on the <unk> of <unk> , at the second <unk> of the <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> on the <unk> all over the English <unk> .
<unk> one is to be <unk> in the deserted region of Chancery Lane .
If such a lonely member of the bar do <unk> across the waste , and come upon a <unk> suitor who is unable to leave off <unk> the <unk> of his anxiety , they <unk> one another and retreat into opposite shades .
It is the <unk> long vacation known for many years .
All the young clerks are <unk> in love , and according to their various degrees , <unk> for <unk> with the beloved object , at <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> .
All the middle-aged clerks think their families too large .
All the <unk> dogs who stray into the <unk> of Court and <unk> about staircases and other dry places seeking water give short <unk> of <unk> .
All the blind men ’ s dogs in the streets draw their masters against <unk> or <unk> them over <unk> .
A shop with a <unk> , and a <unk> pavement , and a <unk> of gold and silver fish in the window , is a sanctuary .
Temple <unk> gets so hot that it is , to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> Street , what a <unk> is in an <unk> , and keeps them <unk> all night .
There are offices about the <unk> of Court in which a man might be cool , if any coolness were worth <unk> at such a price in <unk> ; but the little <unk> immediately outside those <unk> seem to blaze .
In Mr. Krook ’ s court , it is so hot that the people turn their houses inside out and sit in chairs upon the pavement — Mr.
Krook included , who there pursues his studies , with his cat ( who never is too hot ) by his side .
The Sol ’ s Arms has <unk> the Harmonic <unk> for the season , and Little Swills is engaged at the <unk> <unk> down the river , where he comes out in quite an innocent manner and sings <unk> <unk> of a juvenile complexion calculated ( as the bill says ) not to wound the feelings of the most <unk> mind .
Over all the legal neighbourhood there <unk> , like some great veil of <unk> or <unk> <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> of the long vacation .
Mr. Snagsby , law-stationer of Cook ’ s Court , Cursitor Street , is sensible of the influence not only in his mind as a <unk> and <unk> man , but also in his business as a law-stationer aforesaid .
He has more leisure for musing in <unk> Inn and in the <unk> Yard during the long vacation than at other seasons , and he says to the two ’ prentices , what a thing it is in such hot weather to think that you live in an <unk> with the sea <unk> and <unk> right round you .
Guster is busy in the little drawing-room on this present afternoon in the long vacation , when Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby have it in contemplation to receive company .
The expected guests are rather <unk> than numerous , being Mr. and Mrs. Chadband and no more .
From Mr. Chadband ’ s being much given to describe himself , both <unk> and in writing , as a vessel , he is occasionally mistaken by <unk> for a gentleman connected with <unk> , but he is , as he expresses it , “ in the <unk> . ” Mr. Chadband is attached to no particular <unk> and is considered by his <unk> to have nothing so very remarkable to say on the greatest of subjects as to render his <unk> , on his own account , at all <unk> on his conscience ; but he has his followers , and Mrs. Snagsby is of the number .
Mrs. Snagsby has but recently taken a passage upward by the vessel , Chadband ; and her attention was attracted to that <unk> A 1 , when she was something flushed by the hot weather .
“ My little woman , ” says Mr. Snagsby to the <unk> in <unk> Inn , “ likes to have her <unk> rather sharp , you see ! ” So Guster , much impressed by regarding herself for the time as the <unk> of Chadband , whom she knows to be <unk> with the <unk> of holding forth for four hours at a stretch , prepares the little drawing-room for tea .
All the furniture is shaken and <unk> , the portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are touched up with a wet cloth , the best <unk> is set forth , and there is excellent <unk> made of <unk> new bread , <unk> <unk> , cool fresh butter , thin <unk> of ham , tongue , and German <unk> , and delicate little rows of <unk> <unk> in <unk> , not to mention <unk> <unk> , to be brought up warm in a <unk> , and hot <unk> toast .
For Chadband is rather a <unk> vessel — the <unk> say a <unk> vessel — and can <unk> such weapons of the flesh as a knife and fork remarkably well .
Mr. Snagsby in his best coat , looking at all the preparations when they are completed and coughing his cough of deference behind his hand , says to Mrs. Snagsby , “ At what time did you expect Mr. and Mrs. Chadband , my love ? ” “ At six , ” says Mrs. Snagsby .
Mr. Snagsby observes in a mild and <unk> way that “ it ’ s gone that . ” “ Perhaps you ’ d like to begin without them , ” is Mrs. Snagsby ’ s <unk> remark .
Mr. Snagsby does look as if he would like it very much , but he says , with his cough of <unk> , “ No , my dear , no .
I merely named the time . ” “ What ’ s time , ” says Mrs. Snagsby , “ to <unk> ? ” “ Very true , my dear , ” says Mr. Snagsby .
“ Only when a person lays in <unk> for tea , a person does it with a view — perhaps — more to time .
And when a time is named for having tea , it ’ s better to come up to it . ” “ To come up to it ! ” Mrs. Snagsby repeats with severity .
“ Up to it !
As if Mr. Chadband was a <unk> ! ” “ Not at all , my dear , ” says Mr. Snagsby .
Here , Guster , who had been looking out of the bedroom window , comes rustling and <unk> down the little staircase like a popular ghost , and falling flushed into the drawing-room , <unk> that Mr. and Mrs. Chadband have appeared in the court .
The bell at the inner door in the passage immediately <unk> <unk> , she is <unk> by Mrs. Snagsby , on pain of instant <unk> to her patron saint , not to <unk> the ceremony of announcement .
Much <unk> in her <unk> ( which were previously in the best order ) by this <unk> , she so fearfully <unk> that point of state as to <unk> “ Mr.
and Mrs. <unk> , least which , <unk> , <unk> ! ” and retires <unk> from the presence .
Mr. Chadband is a large yellow man with a fat smile and a general appearance of having a good deal of train oil in his system .
Mrs. Chadband is a stern , <unk> , silent woman .
Mr. Chadband moves softly and <unk> , not unlike a bear who has been taught to walk upright .
He is very much embarrassed about the arms , as if they were inconvenient to him and he wanted to <unk> , is very much in a <unk> about the head , and never speaks without first putting up his great hand , as delivering a <unk> to his <unk> that he is going to <unk> them .
“ My friends , ” says Mr. Chadband , “ peace be on this house !
On the master thereof , on the mistress thereof , on the young <unk> , and on the young men !
My friends , why do I wish for peace ?
What is peace ?
Is it <unk> ?
No .
Is it <unk> ?
No .
Is it lovely , and gentle , and beautiful , and pleasant , and serene , and joyful ?
Oh , yes !
Therefore , my friends , I wish for peace , upon you and upon yours . ” In consequence of Mrs. Snagsby looking deeply <unk> , Mr. Snagsby thinks it <unk> on the whole to say <unk> , which is well received .
“ Now , my friends , ” proceeds Mr. Chadband , “ since I am upon this theme — ” Guster presents herself .
Mrs. Snagsby , in a <unk> <unk> voice and without removing her eyes from Chadband , says with dreadful distinctness , “ Go away ! ” “ Now , my friends , ” says Chadband , “ since I am upon this theme , and in my <unk> path improving it — ” Guster is heard <unk> to murmur “ one <unk> seven hundred and <unk> . ” The <unk> voice repeats more solemnly , “ Go away ! ” “ Now , my friends , ” says Mr. Chadband , “ we will inquire in a spirit of love — ” Still Guster <unk> “ one <unk> seven hundred and <unk> . ” Mr. Chadband , pausing with the resignation of a man accustomed to be <unk> and languidly folding up his chin into his fat smile , says , “ Let us hear the <unk> !
Speak , <unk> ! ” “ One <unk> seven hundred and <unk> , if you please , sir .
Which he wish to know what the shilling <unk> for , ” says Guster , breathless .
“ For ? ” returns Mrs. Chadband .
“ For his <unk> ! ” Guster replied that “ he <unk> on one and <unk> or on <unk> the party . ” Mrs. Snagsby and Mrs. Chadband are proceeding to grow shrill in indignation when Mr. Chadband <unk> the <unk> by lifting up his hand .
“ My friends , ” says he , “ I remember a duty <unk> yesterday .
It is right that I should be <unk> in some <unk> .
I ought not to murmur .
Rachael , pay the <unk> ! ” While Mrs. Snagsby , drawing her breath , looks hard at Mr. Snagsby , as who should say , “ You hear this <unk> ! ” and while Mr. Chadband <unk> with humility and train oil , Mrs. Chadband <unk> the money .
It is Mr. Chadband ’ s habit — it is the head and front of his pretensions indeed — to keep this sort of <unk> and <unk> account in the <unk> <unk> and to post it <unk> on the most trivial occasions .
“ My friends , ” says Chadband , “ <unk> is not much ; it might justly have been one and <unk> ; it might justly have been half a crown .
O let us be joyful , joyful !
O let us be joyful ! ” With which remark , which appears from its sound to be an <unk> in <unk> , Mr. Chadband <unk> to the table , and before taking a chair , lifts up his <unk> hand .
“ My friends , ” says he , “ what is this which we now behold as being spread before us ?
<unk> .
Do we need refreshment then , my friends ?
We do .
And why do we need refreshment , my friends ?
Because we are but mortal , because we are but <unk> , because we are but of the earth , because we are not of the air .
Can we fly , my friends ?
We cannot .
Why can we not fly , my friends ? ” Mr. Snagsby , <unk> on the success of his last point , ventures to observe in a cheerful and rather knowing tone , “ No wings . ” But is immediately <unk> down by Mrs. Snagsby .
“ I say , my friends , ” pursues Mr. Chadband , utterly <unk> and <unk> Mr. Snagsby ’ s <unk> , “ why can we not fly ?
Is it because we are calculated to walk ?
It is .
Could we walk , my friends , without strength ?
We could not .
What should we do without strength , my friends ?
Our legs would refuse to bear us , our knees would double up , our <unk> would turn over , and we should come to the ground .
Then from whence , my friends , in a human point of view , do we <unk> the strength that is necessary to our <unk> ?
Is it , ” says Chadband , glancing over the table , “ from bread in various forms , from butter which is <unk> from the milk which is yielded unto us by the <unk> , from the <unk> which are laid by the <unk> , from ham , from tongue , from <unk> , and from such like ?
It is .
Then let us partake of the good things which are set before us ! ” The <unk> <unk> that there was any particular <unk> in Mr. Chadband ’ s <unk> <unk> <unk> of stairs , one upon another , after this fashion .
But this can only be received as a proof of their determination to <unk> , since it must be within everybody ’ s experience that the Chadband style of <unk> is <unk> received and much admired .
Mr. Chadband , however , having concluded for the present , sits down at Mr. Snagsby ’ s table and lays about him <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> of any sort into oil of the quality already mentioned appears to be a process so <unk> from the <unk> of this exemplary vessel that in beginning to eat and drink , he may be described as always becoming a kind of considerable oil <unk> or other large factory for the <unk> of that article on a <unk> scale .
On the present evening of the long vacation , in Cook ’ s Court , Cursitor Street , he does such a powerful <unk> of business that the <unk> appears to be quite full when the works <unk> .
At this period of the entertainment , Guster , who has never recovered her first failure , but has neglected no possible or impossible means of bringing the establishment and herself into contempt — among which may be briefly <unk> her unexpectedly performing <unk> military music on Mr. Chadband ’ s head with <unk> , and afterwards <unk> that gentleman with <unk> — at which period of the entertainment , Guster whispers Mr. Snagsby that he is wanted .
“ And being wanted in the — not to put too fine a point upon it — in the shop , ” says Mr. Snagsby , rising , “ perhaps this good company will excuse me for half a minute . ” Mr. Snagsby <unk> and finds the two ’ prentices <unk> contemplating a police constable , who holds a ragged boy by the arm .
“ Why , bless my heart , ” says Mr. Snagsby , “ what ’ s the matter ! ” “ This boy , ” says the constable , “ although he ’ s repeatedly told to , won ’ t move on — ” “ I ’ m always a-moving on , <unk> , ” cries the boy , wiping away his <unk> tears with his arm .
“ I ’ ve always been a-moving and a-moving on , ever since I was born .
Where can I possibly move to , sir , more nor I do move ! ” “ He won ’ t move on , ” says the constable calmly , with a slight professional <unk> of his neck <unk> its better settlement in his stiff stock , “ although he has been repeatedly <unk> , and therefore I am obliged to take him into custody .
He ’ s as obstinate a young <unk> as I know .
He <unk> ’ T move on . ” “ Oh , my eye !
Where can I move to ! ” cries the boy , <unk> quite <unk> at his hair and beating his bare feet upon the floor of Mr. Snagsby ’ s passage .
“ Don ’ t you come none of that or I shall make blessed short work of you ! ” says the constable , giving him a <unk> shake .
“ My instructions are that you are to move on .
I have told you so five hundred times . ” “ But where ? ” cries the boy .
“ Well !
Really , constable , you know , ” says Mr. Snagsby <unk> , and coughing behind his hand his cough of great perplexity and doubt , “ really , that does seem a question .
Where , you know ? ” “ My instructions don ’ t go to that , ” replies the constable .
“ My instructions are that this boy is to move on . ” Do you hear , Jo ?
It is nothing to you or to any one else that the great lights of the <unk> sky have failed for some few years in this business to set you the example of moving on .
The one grand <unk> remains for you — the profound <unk> <unk> — the <unk> and the <unk> of your strange existence upon earth .
<unk> on !
You are by no means to move off , Jo , for the great lights can ’ t at all agree about that .
<unk> on !
Mr. Snagsby says nothing to this effect , says nothing at all indeed , but coughs his <unk> cough , expressive of no thoroughfare in any direction .
By this time Mr. and Mrs. Chadband and Mrs. Snagsby , hearing the <unk> , have appeared upon the stairs .
Guster having never left the end of the passage , the whole household are assembled .
“ The simple question is , sir , ” says the constable , “ whether you know this boy .
He says you do . ” Mrs. Snagsby , from her <unk> , instantly cries out , “ No he don ’ t ! ” “ My <unk> woman ! ” says Mr. Snagsby , looking up the staircase .
“ My love , <unk> me !
Pray have a moment ’ s patience , my dear .
I do know something of this lad , and in what I know of him , I can ’ t say that there ’ s any harm ; perhaps on the contrary , constable . ” To whom the law-stationer relates his <unk> and <unk> experience , <unk> the half-crown fact .
“ Well ! ” says the constable , “ so far , it seems , he had grounds for what he said .
When I took him into custody up in Holborn , he said you knew him .
Upon that , a young man who was in the crowd said he was acquainted with you , and you were a respectable housekeeper , and if I ’ d call and make the inquiry , he ’ d appear .
The young man don ’ t seem inclined to keep his word , but — Oh !
Here IS the young man ! ” <unk> Mr. Guppy , who nods to Mr. Snagsby and touches his hat with the <unk> of <unk> to the ladies on the stairs .
“ I was <unk> away from the office just now when I found this row going on , ” says Mr. Guppy to the law-stationer , “ and as your name was mentioned , I thought it was right the thing should be looked into . ” “ It was very <unk> of you , sir , ” says Mr. Snagsby , “ and I am obliged to you . ” And Mr. Snagsby again relates his experience , again <unk> the half-crown fact .
“ Now , I know where you live , ” says the constable , then , to Jo .
“ You live down in Tom-all-Alone ’ s .
That ’ s a nice innocent place to live in , ain ’ t it ? ” “ I can ’ t go and live in no <unk> place , sir , ” replies Jo .
“ They wouldn ’ t have nothink to say to me if I wos to go to a nice innocent place fur to live .
Who <unk> go and let a nice innocent lodging to such a <unk> ’ <unk> one as me ! ” “ You are very poor , ain ’ t you ? ” says the constable .
“ Yes , I am indeed , sir , wery poor in <unk> ’ <unk> , ” replies Jo .
“ I leave you to judge now !
I shook these two <unk> out of him , ” says the constable , producing them to the company , “ in only putting my hand upon him ! ” “ They ’ re wot ’ s left , Mr. Snagsby , ” says Jo , “ out of a <unk> as wos give me by a lady in a wale as <unk> she wos a servant and as come to my <unk> one night and asked to be <unk> this ’ <unk> ouse and the ouse wot him as you giv the <unk> to died at , and the <unk> wot he ’ s <unk> in .
She ses to me she ses ‘ are you the boy at the inkwhich ? ’ she ses .
I ses ‘ yes ’ I ses .
She ses to me she ses ‘ can you show me all them places ? ’ I ses ‘ yes I can ’ I ses .
And she ses to me ‘ do it ’ and I <unk> it and she giv me a <unk> ’ ring and <unk> it .
And I an ’ t had much of the <unk> ’ ring neither , ” says Jo , with dirty tears , “ fur I had to pay five <unk> , down in Tom-all-Alone ’ s , afore they ’ d square it fur to give me change , and then a young man he <unk> another five while I was asleep and another boy he <unk> <unk> and the landlord he stood <unk> round with a lot more on it . ” “ You don ’ t expect anybody to believe this , about the lady and the sovereign , do you ? ” says the constable , eyeing him aside with <unk> <unk> .
“ I don ’ t know as I do , sir , ” replies Jo .
“ I don ’ t expect nothink at all , sir , much , but that ’ s the true <unk> ’ <unk> on it . ” “ You see what he is ! ” the constable observes to the audience .
“ Well , Mr. Snagsby , if I don ’ t lock him up this time , will you engage for his moving on ? ” “ No ! ” cries Mrs. Snagsby from the stairs .
“ My little woman ! ” <unk> her husband .
“ <unk> , I have no doubt he ’ ll move on .
You know you really must do it , ” says Mr. Snagsby .
“ I ’ m <unk> agreeable , sir , ” says the <unk> Jo .
“ Do it , then , ” observes the constable .
“ You know what you have got to do .
Do it !
And recollect you won ’ t get off so easy next time .
<unk> hold of your money .
Now , the sooner you ’ re five mile off , the better for all parties . ” With this farewell hint and pointing generally to the setting sun as a likely place to move on to , the constable <unk> his <unk> good afternoon and makes the <unk> of Cook ’ s Court <unk> slow music for him as he walks away on the shady side , carrying his <unk> hat in his hand for a little <unk> .
Now , Jo ’ s <unk> story concerning the lady and the sovereign has awakened more or less the curiosity of all the company .
Mr. Guppy , who has an <unk> mind in matters of evidence and who has been suffering severely from the <unk> of the long vacation , takes that interest in the case that he enters on a regular <unk> of the witness , which is found so interesting by the ladies that Mrs. Snagsby politely <unk> him to step upstairs and drink a cup of tea , if he will excuse the <unk> state of the <unk> , <unk> on their previous <unk> .
Mr. Guppy yielding his assent to this proposal , Jo is requested to follow into the drawing-room doorway , where Mr. Guppy takes him in hand as a witness , <unk> him into this shape , that shape , and the other shape like a <unk> dealing with so much butter , and <unk> him according to the best <unk> .
Nor is the examination unlike many such model <unk> , both in respect of its <unk> nothing and of its being <unk> , for Mr. Guppy is sensible of his talent , and Mrs. Snagsby feels not only that it <unk> her inquisitive disposition , but that it lifts her husband ’ s establishment higher up in the law .
During the progress of this keen encounter , the vessel Chadband , being merely engaged in the oil trade , gets <unk> and <unk> to be <unk> off .
“ Well ! ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ <unk> this boy sticks to it like <unk> ’ <unk> or there is something out of the common here that beats anything that ever came into my way at Kenge and Carboy ’ s . ” Mrs. Chadband whispers Mrs. Snagsby , who exclaims , “ You don ’ t say so ! ” “ For years ! ” replied Mrs. Chadband .
“ Has known Kenge and Carboy ’ s office for years , ” Mrs. Snagsby triumphantly explains to Mr. Guppy .
“ Mrs.
Chadband — this gentleman ’ s wife — <unk> Mr. Chadband . ” “ Oh , indeed ! ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ Before I married my present husband , ” says Mrs. Chadband .
“ Was you a party in anything , ma ’ am ? ” says Mr. Guppy , <unk> his <unk> .
“ No . ” “ NOT a party in anything , ma ’ am ? ” says Mr. Guppy .
Mrs. Chadband shakes her head .
“ Perhaps you were acquainted with somebody who was a party in something , ma ’ am ? ” says Mr. Guppy , who likes nothing better than to model his conversation on forensic principles .
“ Not exactly that , either , ” replies Mrs. Chadband , <unk> the joke with a <unk> smile .
“ Not exactly that , either ! ” repeats Mr. Guppy .
“ Very good .
Pray , ma ’ am , was it a lady of your acquaintance who had some <unk> ( we will not at present say what <unk> ) with Kenge and Carboy ’ s office , or was it a gentleman of your acquaintance ?
Take time , ma ’ am .
We shall come to it presently .
<unk> or woman , ma ’ am ? ” “ Neither , ” says Mrs. Chadband as before .
“ Oh !
A child ! ” says Mr. Guppy , throwing on the admiring Mrs. Snagsby the regular <unk> professional eye which is thrown on British jurymen .
“ Now , ma ’ am , perhaps you ’ ll have the kindness to tell us <unk> child . ” “ You have got it at last , sir , ” says Mrs. Chadband with another <unk> smile .
“ Well , sir , it was before your time , most likely , judging from your appearance .
I was left in charge of a child named Esther Summerson , who was put out in life by Messrs. Kenge and Carboy . ” “ Miss Summerson , ma ’ am ! ” cries Mr. Guppy , excited .
“ I call her Esther Summerson , ” says Mrs. Chadband with <unk> .
“ There was no <unk> of the girl in my time .
It was Esther .
‘ Esther , do this !
Esther , do that ! ’ and she was made to do it . ” “ My dear ma ’ am , ” returns Mr. Guppy , moving across the small apartment , “ the humble individual who now addresses you received that young lady in London when she first came here from the establishment to which you have <unk> .
<unk> me to have the pleasure of taking you by the hand . ” Mr. Chadband , at last seeing his opportunity , makes his accustomed signal and rises with a smoking head , which he <unk> with his <unk> .
Mrs. Snagsby whispers “ Hush ! ” “ My friends , ” says Chadband , “ we have <unk> in <unk> ” ( which was certainly not the case so far as he was concerned ) “ of the comforts which have been provided for us .
May this house live upon the <unk> of the land ; may <unk> and wine be <unk> <unk> ; may it grow , may it <unk> , may it <unk> , may it advance , may it proceed , may it press forward !
But , my friends , have we <unk> of anything else ?
We have .
My friends , of what else have we <unk> ?
Of spiritual profit ?
Yes .
From whence have we derived that spiritual profit ?
My young friend , stand forth ! ” Jo , thus <unk> , gives a <unk> backward , and another <unk> forward , and another <unk> to each side , and <unk> the eloquent Chadband with evident doubts of his intentions .
“ My young friend , ” says Chadband , “ you are to us a pearl , you are to us a <unk> , you are to us a <unk> , you are to us a jewel .
And why , my young friend ? ” “ I don ’ t know , ” replies Jo .
“ I don ’ t know nothink . ” “ My young friend , ” says Chadband , “ it is because you know nothing that you are to us a <unk> and jewel .
For what are you , my young friend ?
Are you a <unk> of the field ?
No .
A bird of the air ?
No .
A fish of the sea or river ?
No .
You are a human boy , my young friend .
A human boy .
O glorious to be a human boy !
And why glorious , my young friend ?
Because you are capable of receiving the <unk> of wisdom , because you are capable of <unk> by this discourse which I now deliver for your good , because you are not a stick , or a staff , or a stock , or a stone , or a post , or a pillar .
O running stream of sparkling joy To be a <unk> human boy !
And do you cool yourself in that stream now , my young friend ?
No .
Why do you not cool yourself in that stream now ?
Because you are in a state of darkness , because you are in a state of <unk> , because you are in a state of <unk> , because you are in a state of <unk> .
My young friend , what is <unk> ?
Let us , in a spirit of love , inquire . ” At this threatening stage of the discourse , Jo , who seems to have been gradually going out of his mind , <unk> his right arm over his face and gives a terrible <unk> .
Mrs. Snagsby indignantly expresses her belief that he is a limb of the <unk> .
“ My friends , ” says Mr. Chadband with his <unk> chin folding itself into its fat smile again as he looks round , “ it is right that I should be <unk> , it is right that I should be tried , it is right that I should be <unk> , it is right that I should be <unk> .
I <unk> , on <unk> last , when I thought with pride of my three hours ’ improving .
The account is now <unk> <unk> : my <unk> has accepted a composition .
O let us be joyful , joyful !
O let us be joyful ! ” Great sensation on the part of Mrs. Snagsby .
“ My friends , ” says Chadband , looking round him in conclusion , “ I will not proceed with my young friend now .
Will you come to-morrow , my young friend , and inquire of this good lady where I am to be found to deliver a discourse unto you , and will you come like the <unk> <unk> upon the next day , and upon the day after that , and upon the day after that , and upon many pleasant days , to hear <unk> ? ” ( This with a <unk> <unk> . )
Jo , whose immediate object seems to be to get away on any terms , gives a shuffling nod .
Mr. Guppy then throws him a penny , and Mrs. Snagsby calls to Guster to see him safely out of the house .
But before he goes downstairs , Mr. Snagsby <unk> him with some broken <unk> from the table , which he carries away , <unk> in his arms .
So , Mr. Chadband — of whom the <unk> say that it is no wonder he should go on for any length of time <unk> such <unk> nonsense , but that the wonder rather is that he should ever leave off , having once the <unk> to begin — retires into private life until he <unk> a little capital of supper in the <unk> .
Jo moves on , through the long vacation , down to <unk> <unk> , where he finds a <unk> <unk> corner <unk> to settle to his <unk> .
And there he sits , <unk> and <unk> , and looking up at the great cross on the <unk> of St. <unk> ’ s <unk> , glittering above a <unk> cloud of smoke .
From the boy ’ s face one might suppose that sacred <unk> to be , in his eyes , the <unk> confusion of the great , confused city — so golden , so high up , so far out of his reach .
There he sits , the sun going down , the river running fast , the crowd <unk> by him in two streams — everything moving on to some purpose and to one end — until he is stirred up and told to “ move on ” too .
CHAPTER <unk> A New <unk> The long vacation <unk> on towards <unk> like an idle river very leisurely <unk> down a flat country to the sea .
Mr. Guppy <unk> along with it <unk> .
He has <unk> the <unk> of his <unk> and broken the point off by sticking that instrument into his desk in every direction .
Not that he bears the desk any ill will , but he must do something , and it must be something of an <unk> nature , which will lay neither his physical nor his intellectual <unk> under too heavy <unk> .
He finds that nothing <unk> with him so well as to make little <unk> on one leg of his stool , and <unk> his desk , and <unk> .
Kenge and Carboy are out of town , and the <unk> clerk has taken out a shooting license and gone down to his father ’ s , and Mr. Guppy ’ s two <unk> are away on leave .
Mr. Guppy and Mr. Richard Carstone <unk> the dignity of the office .
But Mr. Carstone is for the time being established in Kenge ’ s room , <unk> Mr. Guppy <unk> .
So exceedingly that he with biting <unk> informs his mother , in the confidential moments when he <unk> with her off a <unk> and <unk> in the Old Street Road , that he is afraid the office is hardly good enough for <unk> , and that if he had known there was a swell coming , he would have got it painted .
Mr. Guppy suspects everybody who enters on the occupation of a stool in Kenge and Carboy ’ s office of <unk> , as a matter of course , <unk> <unk> upon him .
He is clear that every such person wants to <unk> him .
If he be ever asked how , why , when , or <unk> , he shuts up one eye and shakes his head .
On the strength of these profound views , he in the most <unk> manner takes infinite pains to <unk> when there is no <unk> , and plays the deepest games of <unk> without any <unk> .
It is a source of much gratification to Mr. Guppy , therefore , to find the <unk> constantly <unk> over the papers in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , for he well knows that nothing but confusion and failure can come of that .
His satisfaction <unk> itself to a third <unk> through the long vacation in Kenge and Carboy ’ s office , to wit , Young Smallweed .
Whether Young Smallweed ( <unk> called Small and <unk> <unk> <unk> , as it were <unk> to express a <unk> ) was ever a boy is much doubted in Lincoln ’ s Inn .
He is now something under fifteen and an old limb of the law .
He is <unk> understood to entertain a passion for a lady at a <unk> in the neighbourhood of Chancery Lane and for her sake to have broken off a <unk> with another lady , to whom he had been engaged some years .
He is a <unk> article , of small <unk> and <unk> features , but may be perceived from a considerable distance by means of his very tall hat .
To become a Guppy is the object of his ambition .
He dresses at that gentleman ( by whom he is <unk> ) , talks at him , walks at him , <unk> himself entirely on him .
He is honoured with Mr. Guppy ’ s particular confidence and occasionally <unk> him , from the deep <unk> of his experience , on difficult points in private life .
Mr. Guppy has been <unk> out of window all the morning after trying all the <unk> in succession and finding none of them easy , and after several times putting his head into the iron safe with a <unk> of <unk> it .
Mr. Smallweed has been twice <unk> for <unk> drinks , and has twice mixed them in the two official <unk> and stirred them up with the <unk> .
Mr. Guppy <unk> for Mr. Smallweed ’ s consideration the <unk> that the more you drink the <unk> you are and <unk> his head upon the window-sill in a state of hopeless <unk> .
While thus looking out into the shade of Old Square , Lincoln ’ s Inn , <unk> the intolerable bricks and mortar , Mr. Guppy becomes conscious of a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> walk below and turning itself up in the direction of his face .
At the same time , a low whistle is <unk> through the Inn and a suppressed voice cries , “ <unk> !
<unk> ! ” “ Why , you don ’ t mean it ! ” says Mr. Guppy , aroused .
“ Small !
Here ’ s Jobling ! ” Small ’ s head looks out of window too and nods to Jobling .
“ Where have you <unk> up from ? ” inquires Mr. Guppy .
“ From the <unk> down by <unk> .
I can ’ t stand it any longer .
I must <unk> .
I say !
I wish you ’ d lend me half a crown .
Upon my soul , I ’ m hungry . ” Jobling looks hungry and also has the appearance of having run to <unk> in the <unk> down by <unk> .
“ I say !
Just throw out half a crown if you have got one to spare .
I want to get some dinner . ” “ Will you come and dine with me ? ” says Mr. Guppy , throwing out the <unk> , which Mr. Jobling catches neatly .
“ How long should I have to hold out ? ” says Jobling .
“ Not half an hour .
I am only waiting here till the enemy goes , ” returns Mr. Guppy , <unk> inward with his head .
“ What enemy ? ” “ A new one .
Going to be <unk> .
Will you wait ? ” “ Can you give a fellow anything to read in the meantime ? ” says Mr. Jobling .
Smallweed suggests the law list .
But Mr. Jobling declares with much earnestness that he “ can ’ t stand it . ” “ You shall have the paper , ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ He shall bring it down .
But you had better not be seen about here .
Sit on our staircase and read .
It ’ s a quiet place . ” Jobling nods intelligence and <unk> .
The sagacious Smallweed <unk> him with the newspaper and occasionally drops his eye upon him from the landing as a precaution against his becoming <unk> with waiting and making an <unk> departure .
At last the enemy <unk> , and then Smallweed <unk> Mr. Jobling up .
“ Well , and how are you ? ” says Mr. Guppy , shaking hands with him .
“ So , so .
How are you ? ” Mr. Guppy replying that he is not much to boast of , Mr. Jobling ventures on the question , “ How is <unk> ? ” This Mr. Guppy <unk> as a liberty , <unk> , “ Jobling , there ARE chords in the human mind — ” Jobling begs pardon .
“ Any subject but that ! ” says Mr. Guppy with a gloomy enjoyment of his injury .
“ For there ARE chords , Jobling — ” Mr. Jobling begs pardon again .
During this short <unk> , the active Smallweed , who is of the dinner party , has written in legal <unk> on a slip of paper , “ <unk> immediately . ” This <unk> to all whom it may concern , he <unk> in the <unk> , and then putting on the tall hat at the <unk> of inclination at which Mr. Guppy wears his , informs his patron that they may now make themselves <unk> .
<unk> they <unk> themselves to a neighbouring <unk> , of the class known among its <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> , a <unk> young female of forty , is supposed to have made some impression on the susceptible Smallweed , of whom it may be remarked that he is a <unk> <unk> to whom years are nothing .
He stands <unk> possessed of centuries of <unk> wisdom .
If he ever lay in a <unk> , it seems as if he must have <unk> there in a <unk> .
He has an old , old eye , has Smallweed ; and he drinks and smokes in a <unk> way ; and his neck is stiff in his collar ; and he is never to be taken in ; and he knows all about it , whatever it is .
In short , in his bringing up he has been so <unk> by <unk> and Equity that he has become a kind of <unk> <unk> , to account for whose <unk> existence it is reported at the public offices that his father was John <unk> and his mother the only female member of the <unk> family , also that his first <unk> were made from a blue bag .
Into the <unk> , <unk> by the <unk> show in the window of <unk> whitened <unk> and poultry , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , coolly blooming <unk> , and <unk> ready for the <unk> , Mr. Smallweed leads the way .
They know him there and <unk> to him .
He has his favourite box , he <unk> all the papers , he is down upon bald <unk> , who keep them more than ten minutes afterwards .
It is of no use trying him with anything less than a <unk> “ bread ” or proposing to him any <unk> in cut unless it is in the very best cut .
In the matter of gravy he is <unk> .
<unk> of his <unk> power and <unk> to his dread experience , Mr. Guppy <unk> him in the choice of that day ’ s <unk> , turning an <unk> look towards him as the <unk> repeats the <unk> of <unk> and saying “ What do YOU take , <unk> ? ” <unk> , out of the <unk> of his <unk> , <unk> “ <unk> and ham and French <unk> — and don ’ t you forget the <unk> , <unk> ” ( with an <unk> cock of his venerable eye ) , Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling give the like order .
Three pint pots of <unk> are <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> returns bearing what is apparently a model of the <unk> of <unk> but what is really a pile of <unk> and flat tin <unk> .
Mr. Smallweed , approving of what is set before him , <unk> intelligent <unk> into his ancient eye and winks upon her .
Then , <unk> a constant coming in , and going out , and running about , and a <unk> of <unk> , and a <unk> up and down of the <unk> which brings the nice <unk> from the kitchen , and a shrill crying for more nice <unk> down the <unk> , and a shrill <unk> of the cost of nice <unk> that have been disposed of , and a general flush and <unk> of hot <unk> , cut and <unk> , and a considerably <unk> atmosphere in which the <unk> <unk> and <unk> seem to break out <unk> into <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of beer , the legal <unk> <unk> their <unk> .
Mr. Jobling is buttoned up closer than mere <unk> might require .
His hat presents at the <unk> a peculiar appearance of a <unk> nature , as if it had been a favourite <unk> .
The same phenomenon is visible on some parts of his coat , and particularly at the <unk> .
He has the faded appearance of a gentleman in embarrassed circumstances ; even his light whiskers <unk> with something of a shabby air .
His appetite is so <unk> that it suggests spare living for some little time back .
He makes such a <unk> end of his plate of <unk> and ham , bringing it to a close while his companions are yet <unk> in <unk> , that Mr. Guppy proposes another .
“ Thank you , Guppy , ” says Mr. Jobling , “ I really don ’ t know but what I WILL take another . ” Another being brought , he falls to with great <unk> .
Mr. Guppy takes silent notice of him at intervals until he is half way through this second plate and stops to take an enjoying pull at his pint pot of <unk> ( also renewed ) and stretches out his legs and rubs his hands .
<unk> him in which glow of <unk> , Mr. Guppy says , “ You are a man again , Tony ! ” “ Well , not quite yet , ” says Mr. Jobling .
“ Say , just born . ” “ Will you take any other <unk> ?
<unk> ?
<unk> ?
<unk> cabbage ? ” “ Thank you , Guppy , ” says Mr. Jobling .
“ I really don ’ t know but what I WILL take summer cabbage . ” <unk> given ; with the <unk> addition ( from Mr. Smallweed ) of “ Without <unk> , <unk> ! ” And cabbage produced .
“ I am growing up , Guppy , ” says Mr. Jobling , <unk> his knife and fork with a <unk> <unk> .
“ Glad to hear it . ” “ In fact , I have just turned into my <unk> , ” says Mr. Jobling .
He says no more until he has performed his task , which he <unk> as Messrs. Guppy and Smallweed finish <unk> , thus getting over the ground in excellent style and beating those two gentlemen easily by a <unk> and ham and a cabbage .
“ Now , Small , ” says Mr. Guppy , “ what would you recommend about <unk> ? ” “ <unk> <unk> , ” says Mr. Smallweed instantly .
“ Aye , aye ! ” cries Mr. Jobling with an arch look .
“ You ’ re there , are you ?
Thank you , Mr. Guppy , I don ’ t know but what I WILL take a <unk> <unk> . ” Three <unk> <unk> being produced , Mr. Jobling adds in a pleasant humour that he is coming of age fast .
To these succeed , by command of Mr. Smallweed , “ three <unk> , ” and to those “ three small <unk> . ” This <unk> of the entertainment happily reached , Mr. Jobling puts up his legs on the <unk> seat ( having his own side of the box to himself ) , leans against the wall , and says , “ I am grown up now , Guppy .
I have arrived at <unk> . ” “ What do you think , now , ” says Mr. Guppy , “ about — you don ’ t mind Smallweed ? ” “ Not the least in the world .
I have the pleasure of drinking his good health . ” “ Sir , to you ! ” says Mr. Smallweed .
“ I was saying , what do you think <unk> , ” pursues Mr. Guppy , “ of <unk> ? ” “ Why , what I may think after dinner , ” returns Mr. Jobling , “ is one thing , my dear Guppy , and what I may think before dinner is another thing .
Still , even after dinner , I ask myself the question , What am I to do ?
How am I to live ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> , you know , ” says Mr. Jobling , <unk> that word as if he meant a necessary <unk> in an English stable .
“ <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That ’ s the French saying , and <unk> is as necessary to me as it is to a <unk> .
Or more so . ” Mr. Smallweed is decidedly of opinion “ much more so . ” “ If any man had told me , ” pursues Jobling , “ even so lately as when you and I had the <unk> down in Lincolnshire , Guppy , and drove over to see that house at <unk> Wold — ” Mr. Smallweed <unk> him — Chesney Wold .
“ Chesney Wold .
( I thank my honourable friend for that cheer . )
If any man had told me then that I should be as hard up at the present time as I <unk> find myself , I should have — well , I should have <unk> into him , ” says Mr. Jobling , taking a little <unk> with an air of desperate resignation ; “ I should have let fly at his head . ” “ Still , Tony , you were on the wrong side of the post then , ” remonstrates Mr. Guppy .
“ You were talking about nothing else in the gig . ” “ Guppy , ” says Mr. Jobling , “ I will not deny it .
I was on the wrong side of the post .
But I trusted to things coming round . ” That very popular trust in flat things coming round !
Not in their being beaten round , or worked round , but in their “ coming ” round !
As though a <unk> should trust in the world ’ s “ coming ” <unk> !
“ I had confident expectations that things would come round and be all square , ” says Mr. Jobling with some <unk> of expression and perhaps of meaning too .
“ But I was disappointed .
They never did .
And when it came to <unk> making rows at the office and to people that the office <unk> with making <unk> about dirty <unk> of borrowed money , why there was an end of that connexion .
And of any new professional connexion too , for if I was to give a reference to-morrow , it would be mentioned and would <unk> me up .
Then what ’ s a fellow to do ?
I have been keeping out of the way and living cheap down about the <unk> , but what ’ s the use of living cheap when you have got no money ?
You might as well live dear . ” “ Better , ” Mr. Smallweed thinks .
“ Certainly .
It ’ s the fashionable way ; and fashion and whiskers have been my weaknesses , and I don ’ t care who knows it , ” says Mr. Jobling .
“ They are great weaknesses — <unk> , sir , they are great .
Well , ” proceeds Mr. Jobling after a <unk> visit to his <unk> , “ what can a fellow do , I ask you , <unk> <unk> ? ” Mr. Guppy comes more fully into the conversation to state what , in his opinion , a fellow can do .
His manner is the gravely impressive manner of a man who has not committed himself in life otherwise than as he has become the victim of a tender sorrow of the heart .
“ Jobling , ” says Mr. Guppy , “ myself and our mutual friend Smallweed — ” Mr. Smallweed modestly observes , “ Gentlemen both ! ” and drinks .
“ — Have had a little conversation on this matter more than once since you — ” “ Say , got the <unk> ! ” cries Mr. Jobling bitterly .
“ Say it , Guppy .
You mean it . ” “ <unk> !
<unk> the Inn , ” Mr. Smallweed delicately suggests .
“ Since you left the Inn , Jobling , ” says Mr. Guppy ; “ and I have mentioned to our mutual friend Smallweed a plan I have lately thought of proposing .
You know Snagsby the stationer ? ” “ I know there is such a stationer , ” returns Mr. Jobling .
“ He was not ours , and I am not acquainted with him . ” “ He IS ours , Jobling , and I AM acquainted with him , ” Mr. Guppy retorts .
“ Well , sir !
I have lately become better acquainted with him through some accidental circumstances that have made me a visitor of his in private life .
Those circumstances it is not necessary to offer in argument .
They may — or they may not — have some reference to a subject which may — or may not — have cast its shadow on my existence . ” As it is Mr. Guppy ’ s <unk> way with <unk> misery to <unk> his particular friends into this subject , and the moment they touch it , to turn on them with that <unk> severity about the chords in the human mind , both Mr. Jobling and Mr. Smallweed decline the <unk> by remaining silent .
“ Such things may be , ” repeats Mr. Guppy , “ or they may not be .
They are no part of the case .
It is enough to mention that both Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are very willing to oblige me and that Snagsby has , in busy times , a good deal of copying work to give out .
He has all Tulkinghorn ’ s , and an excellent business besides .
I believe if our mutual friend Smallweed were put into the box , he could prove this ? ” Mr. Smallweed nods and appears <unk> to be <unk> .
“ Now , gentlemen of the jury , ” says Mr. Guppy , “ — I mean , now , Jobling — you may say this is a poor prospect of a living .
<unk> .
But it ’ s better than nothing , and better than <unk> .
You want time .
There must be time for these late affairs to blow over .
You might live through it on much worse terms than by writing for Snagsby . ” Mr. Jobling is about to <unk> when the sagacious Smallweed checks him with a dry cough and the words , “ Hem !
<unk> ! ” “ There are two branches to this subject , Jobling , ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ That is the first .
I come to the second .
You know Krook , the Chancellor , across the lane .
Come , Jobling , ” says Mr. Guppy in his encouraging <unk> , “ I think you know Krook , the Chancellor , across the lane ? ” “ I know him by sight , ” says Mr. Jobling .
“ You know him by sight .
Very well .
And you know little Flite ? ” “ Everybody knows her , ” says Mr. Jobling .
“ Everybody knows her .
<unk> well .
Now it has been one of my duties of late to pay Flite a certain <unk> allowance , <unk> from it the amount of her <unk> rent , which I have paid ( in consequence of instructions I have received ) to Krook himself , regularly in her presence .
This has brought me into communication with Krook and into a knowledge of his house and his habits .
I know he has a room to let .
You may live there at a very low charge under any name you like , as quietly as if you were a hundred miles off .
He ’ ll ask no questions and would accept you as a <unk> at a word from me — before the clock strikes , if you <unk> .
And I tell you another thing , Jobling , ” says Mr. Guppy , who has suddenly <unk> his voice and become familiar again , “ he ’ s an extraordinary old chap — always <unk> among a litter of papers and <unk> away at teaching himself to read and write , without getting on a bit , as it seems to me .
He is a most extraordinary old chap , sir .
I don ’ t know but what it might be worth a fellow ’ s while to look him up a bit . ” “ You don ’ t mean — ” Mr. Jobling begins .
“ I mean , ” returns Mr. Guppy , <unk> his shoulders with becoming modesty , “ that I can ’ t make him out .
I appeal to our mutual friend Smallweed whether he has or has not heard me remark that I can ’ t make him out . ” Mr. Smallweed bears the <unk> testimony , “ A few ! ” “ I have seen something of the profession and something of life , Tony , ” says Mr. Guppy , “ and it ’ s seldom I can ’ t make a man out , more or less .
But such an old card as this , so deep , so <unk> , and secret ( though I don ’ t believe he is ever <unk> ) , I never came across .
Now , he must be precious old , you know , and he has not a soul about him , and he is reported to be <unk> rich ; and whether he is a <unk> , or a <unk> , or an <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> — all of which I have thought likely at different times — it might pay you to knock up a sort of knowledge of him .
I don ’ t see why you shouldn ’ t go in for it , when everything else suits . ” Mr. Jobling , Mr. Guppy , and Mr. Smallweed all lean their elbows on the table and their <unk> upon their hands , and look at the ceiling .
After a time , they all drink , slowly lean back , put their hands in their pockets , and look at one another .
“ If I had the energy I once possessed , Tony ! ” says Mr. Guppy with a sigh .
“ But there are chords in the human mind — ” <unk> the remainder of the desolate sentiment in <unk> , Mr. Guppy concludes by <unk> the <unk> to Tony Jobling and informing him that during the vacation and while things are <unk> , his purse , “ as far as three or four or even five pound goes , ” will be at his disposal .
“ For never shall it be said , ” Mr. Guppy adds with emphasis , “ that William Guppy turned his back upon his friend ! ” The latter part of the proposal is so directly to the purpose that Mr. Jobling says with emotion , “ Guppy , my <unk> , your <unk> ! ” Mr. Guppy presents it , saying , “ Jobling , my boy , there it is ! ” Mr. Jobling returns , “ Guppy , we have been <unk> now for some years ! ” Mr. Guppy replies , “ Jobling , we have . ” They then shake hands , and Mr. Jobling adds in a feeling manner , “ Thank you , Guppy , I don ’ t know but what I WILL take another glass for old acquaintance sake . ” “ Krook ’ s last lodger died there , ” observes Mr. Guppy in an <unk> way .
“ Did he though ! ” says Mr. Jobling .
“ There was a <unk> .
<unk> death .
You don ’ t mind that ? ” “ No , ” says Mr. Jobling , “ I don ’ t mind it ; but he might as well have died somewhere else .
It ’ s <unk> odd that he need go and die at MY place ! ” Mr. Jobling quite <unk> this liberty , several times returning to it with such remarks as , “ There are places enough to die in , I should think ! ” or , “ He wouldn ’ t have liked my dying at HIS place , I dare say ! ” However , the <unk> being <unk> made , Mr. Guppy proposes to dispatch the <unk> Smallweed to <unk> if Mr. Krook is at home , as in that case they may complete the <unk> without delay .
Mr. Jobling approving , Smallweed puts himself under the tall hat and <unk> it out of the <unk> in the Guppy manner .
He soon returns with the intelligence that Mr. Krook is at home and that he has seen him through the shop-door , sitting in the back premises , sleeping “ like one o ’ clock . ” “ Then I ’ ll pay , ” says Mr. Guppy , “ and we ’ ll go and see him .
Small , what will it be ? ” Mr. Smallweed , <unk> the attendance of the <unk> with one <unk> of his <unk> , instantly replies as follows : “ <unk> <unk> and <unk> is three , and four potatoes is three and four , and one summer cabbage is three and six , and three <unk> is four and six , and six <unk> is five , and three <unk> is five and three , and four <unk> of <unk> is six and three , and four small <unk> is eight and three , and three <unk> is eight and six .
<unk> and six in half a sovereign , <unk> , and <unk> out ! ” Not at all excited by these <unk> <unk> , Smallweed <unk> his friends with a cool nod and remains behind to take a little admiring notice of <unk> , as opportunity may serve , and to read the daily papers , which are so very large in <unk> to himself , <unk> of his hat , that when he holds up the <unk> to run his eye over the <unk> , he seems to have retired for the night and to have disappeared under the <unk> .
Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling repair to the rag and bottle shop , where they find Krook still sleeping like one o ’ clock , that is to say , breathing <unk> with his chin upon his breast and quite insensible to any <unk> sounds or even to gentle shaking .
On the table beside him , among the usual <unk> , stand an empty <unk> and a glass .
The unwholesome air is so stained with this <unk> that even the green eyes of the cat upon her shelf , as they open and shut and <unk> on the visitors , look drunk .
“ Hold up here ! ” says Mr. Guppy , giving the <unk> figure of the old man another shake .
“ Mr.
Krook !
<unk> , sir ! ” But it would seem as easy to wake a bundle of old clothes with a <unk> heat <unk> in it .
“ Did you ever see such a <unk> as he falls into , between drink and sleep ? ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ If this is his regular sleep , ” returns Jobling , rather alarmed , “ it ’ ll last a long time one of these days , I am thinking . ” “ It ’ s always more like a fit than a <unk> , ” says Mr. Guppy , shaking him again .
“ <unk> , your lordship !
Why , he might be robbed fifty times over !
<unk> your eyes ! ” After much <unk> , he opens them , but without appearing to see his visitors or any other objects .
Though he crosses one leg on another , and folds his hands , and several times closes and opens his <unk> lips , he seems to all <unk> and purposes as insensible as before .
“ He is alive , at any rate , ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ How are you , my Lord Chancellor .
I have brought a friend of mine , sir , on a little matter of business . ” The old man still sits , often <unk> his dry lips without the least consciousness .
After some minutes he makes an attempt to rise .
They help him up , and he <unk> against the wall and stares at them .
“ How do you do , Mr. Krook ? ” says Mr. Guppy in some <unk> .
“ How do you do , sir ?
You are looking charming , Mr. Krook .
I hope you are pretty well ? ” The old man , in <unk> a <unk> blow at Mr. Guppy , or at nothing , <unk> <unk> himself round and comes with his face against the wall .
So he remains for a minute or two , <unk> up against it , and then <unk> down the shop to the front door .
The air , the movement in the court , the <unk> of time , or the <unk> of these things recovers him .
He comes back pretty steadily , adjusting his fur cap on his head and looking <unk> at them .
“ Your servant , gentlemen ; I ’ ve been <unk> .
Hi !
I am hard to wake , odd times . ” “ <unk> so , indeed , sir , ” <unk> Mr. Guppy .
“ What ?
You ’ ve been <unk> to do it , have you ? ” says the suspicious Krook .
“ Only a little , ” Mr. Guppy explains .
The old man ’ s eye resting on the empty bottle , he takes it up , examines it , and slowly <unk> it <unk> down .
“ I say ! ” he cries like the <unk> in the story .
“ Somebody ’ s been making free here ! ” “ I assure you we found it so , ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ Would you allow me to get it filled for you ? ” “ Yes , certainly I would ! ” cries Krook in high <unk> .
“ Certainly I would !
Don ’ t mention it !
Get it filled next door — Sol ’ s Arms — the Lord Chancellor ’ s <unk> .
Bless you , they know ME ! ” He so <unk> the empty bottle upon Mr. Guppy that that gentleman , with a nod to his friend , <unk> the trust and hurries out and hurries in again with the bottle filled .
The old man receives it in his arms like a beloved <unk> and <unk> it tenderly .
“ But , I say , ” he whispers , with his eyes <unk> up , after <unk> it , “ this ain ’ t the Lord Chancellor ’ s <unk> .
This is <unk> ! ” “ I thought you might like that better , ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ You ’ re a <unk> , sir , ” returns Krook with another taste , and his hot breath seems to come towards them like a <unk> .
“ You ’ re a <unk> of the land . ” <unk> advantage of this <unk> moment , Mr. Guppy presents his friend under the <unk> name of Mr. Weevle and states the object of their visit .
Krook , with his bottle under his arm ( he never gets beyond a certain point of either <unk> or <unk> ) , takes time to <unk> his proposed lodger and seems to approve of him .
“ You ’ d like to see the room , young man ? ” he says .
“ Ah !
It ’ s a good room !
<unk> whitewashed .
<unk> <unk> down with soft soap and <unk> .
Hi !
It ’ s worth twice the rent , letting alone my company when you want it and such a cat to keep the <unk> away . ” <unk> the room after this manner , the old man takes them upstairs , where indeed they do find it <unk> than it used to be and also containing some old articles of furniture which he has <unk> up from his <unk> <unk> .
The terms are easily concluded — for the Lord Chancellor cannot be hard on Mr. Guppy , associated as he is with Kenge and Carboy , Jarndyce and Jarndyce , and other famous claims on his professional consideration — and it is agreed that Mr. Weevle shall take possession on the morrow .
Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy then repair to Cook ’ s Court , Cursitor Street , where the personal introduction of the former to Mr. Snagsby is <unk> and ( more important ) the <unk> and interest of Mrs. Snagsby are secured .
They then report progress to the eminent Smallweed , waiting at the office in his tall hat for that purpose , and separate , Mr. Guppy <unk> that he would <unk> his little entertainment by standing <unk> at the play but that there are chords in the human mind which would render it a hollow <unk> .
On the morrow , in the dusk of evening , Mr. Weevle modestly appears at Krook ’ s , by no means <unk> with <unk> , and <unk> himself in his new lodging , where the two eyes in the shutters stare at him in his sleep , as if they were full of wonder .
On the following day Mr. Weevle , who is a <unk> <unk> kind of young fellow , <unk> a needle and <unk> of Miss Flite and a hammer of his landlord and goes to work <unk> <unk> for <unk> , and knocking up <unk> for <unk> , and hanging up his two <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> on a <unk> of little <unk> , like a <unk> sailor making the best of it .
But what Mr. Weevle <unk> most of all his few <unk> ( next after his light whiskers , for which he has an attachment that only whiskers can <unk> in the breast of man ) is a choice collection of <unk> impressions from that truly national work The <unk> of <unk> , or Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty , <unk> ladies of title and fashion in every variety of <unk> that art , combined with capital , is capable of producing .
With these magnificent portraits , <unk> confined in a <unk> during his <unk> among the <unk> , he <unk> his apartment ; and as the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty wears every variety of fancy dress , plays every variety of musical instrument , <unk> every variety of dog , <unk> every variety of prospect , and is backed up by every variety of <unk> and <unk> , the result is very <unk> .
But fashion is Mr. Weevle ’ s , as it was Tony Jobling ’ s , weakness .
To borrow yesterday ’ s paper from the Sol ’ s Arms of an evening and read about the brilliant and distinguished <unk> that are shooting across the fashionable sky in every direction is unspeakable consolation to him .
To know what member of what brilliant and distinguished circle accomplished the brilliant and distinguished <unk> of <unk> it yesterday or <unk> the no less brilliant and distinguished <unk> of leaving it to-morrow gives him a <unk> of joy .
To be informed what the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty is about , and means to be about , and what Galaxy <unk> are on the <unk> , and what Galaxy <unk> are in <unk> , is to become acquainted with the most glorious <unk> of mankind .
Mr. Weevle <unk> from this intelligence to the Galaxy portraits <unk> , and seems to know the <unk> , and to be known of them .
For the rest he is a quiet lodger , full of <unk> <unk> and <unk> as before mentioned , able to cook and clean for himself as well as to <unk> , and <unk> social <unk> after the shades of evening have fallen on the court .
At those times , when he is not visited by Mr. Guppy or by a small light in his likeness <unk> in a dark hat , he comes out of his dull room — where he has inherited the deal wilderness of desk <unk> with a rain of ink — and talks to Krook or is “ very free , ” as they call it in the court , <unk> , with any one disposed for conversation .
<unk> , Mrs. Piper , who leads the court , is <unk> to offer two remarks to Mrs. Perkins : <unk> , that if her <unk> was to have whiskers , she could wish ’ em to be <unk> like that young man ’ s ; and <unk> , “ <unk> my words , Mrs. Perkins , ma ’ am , and don ’ t you be surprised , Lord bless you , if that young man comes in at last for old Krook ’ s money ! ” CHAPTER <unk> The Smallweed Family In a rather <unk> and <unk> neighbourhood , though one of its rising grounds bears the name of <unk> Pleasant , the <unk> Smallweed , christened <unk> and known on the domestic hearth as Bart , passes that limited portion of his time on which the office and its <unk> have no claim .
He <unk> in a little narrow street , always solitary , shady , and sad , closely <unk> in on all sides like a <unk> , but where there yet <unk> the <unk> of an old <unk> tree whose flavour is about as fresh and natural as the Smallweed <unk> of youth .
There has been only one child in the Smallweed family for several <unk> .
Little old men and women there have been , but no child , until Mr. Smallweed ’ s grandmother , now living , became weak in her <unk> and fell ( for the first time ) into a childish state .
With such <unk> <unk> as a total want of observation , memory , understanding , and interest , and an eternal disposition to fall asleep over the fire and into it , Mr. Smallweed ’ s grandmother has undoubtedly brightened the family .
Mr. Smallweed ’ s grandfather is likewise of the party .
He is in a helpless condition as to his lower , and nearly so as to his upper , <unk> , but his mind is <unk> .
It holds , as well as it ever held , the first four <unk> of <unk> and a certain small collection of the <unk> facts .
In respect of <unk> , <unk> , wonder , and other such <unk> <unk> , it is no worse off than it used to be .
Everything that Mr. Smallweed ’ s grandfather ever put away in his mind was a <unk> at first , and is a <unk> at last .
In all his life he has never bred a single <unk> .
The father of this pleasant grandfather , of the neighbourhood of <unk> Pleasant , was a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> species of <unk> who <unk> <unk> to catch <unk> flies and retired into <unk> until they were <unk> .
The name of this old <unk> ’ s <unk> was <unk> <unk> .
He lived for it , married it , died of it .
Meeting with a heavy loss in an honest little <unk> in which all the loss was intended to have been on the other side , he broke something — something necessary to his existence , therefore it couldn ’ t have been his heart — and made an end of his career .
As his character was not good , and he had been bred at a charity school in a complete course , according to question and answer , of those ancient people the <unk> and <unk> , he was frequently <unk> as an example of the failure of education .
His spirit shone through his son , to whom he had always <unk> of “ going out ” early in life and whom he made a clerk in a sharp <unk> ’ s office at twelve years old .
There the young gentleman improved his mind , which was of a lean and anxious character , and <unk> the family <unk> , gradually elevated himself into the <unk> profession .
Going out early in life and marrying late , as his father had done before him , he too <unk> a lean and <unk> son , who in his turn , going out early in life and marrying late , became the father of <unk> and <unk> Smallweed , <unk> .
During the whole time consumed in the slow growth of this family tree , the house of Smallweed , always early to go out and late to marry , has strengthened itself in its practical character , has <unk> all <unk> , <unk> all <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> all <unk> whatsoever .
Hence the gratifying fact that it has had no child born to it and that the complete little men and women whom it has produced have been observed to bear a likeness to old <unk> with something <unk> on their minds .
At the present time , in the dark little parlour certain feet below the level of the street — a grim , hard , <unk> parlour , only <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and offering in its <unk> character no bad <unk> <unk> of Grandfather Smallweed ’ s mind — seated in two black <unk> <unk> ’ s chairs , one on each side of the fire-place , the <unk> Mr. and Mrs. Smallweed while away the rosy hours .
On the <unk> are a couple of trivets for the pots and <unk> which it is Grandfather Smallweed ’ s usual occupation to watch , and <unk> from the chimney-piece between them is a sort of <unk> <unk> for <unk> , which he also <unk> when it is in action .
Under the venerable Mr. Smallweed ’ s seat and <unk> by his <unk> legs is a drawer in his chair , reported to contain property to a <unk> amount .
<unk> him is a spare cushion with which he is always provided in order that he may have something to throw at the venerable partner of his respected age whenever she makes an allusion to money — a subject on which he is particularly sensitive .
“ And where ’ s Bart ? ” Grandfather Smallweed inquires of Judy , Bart ’ s <unk> sister .
“ He an ’ t come in yet , ” says Judy .
“ It ’ s his <unk> , isn ’ t it ? ” “ No . ” “ How much do you mean to say it wants then ? ” “ Ten minutes . ” “ Hey ? ” “ Ten minutes . ” ( <unk> on the part of Judy . )
“ Ho ! ” says Grandfather Smallweed .
“ Ten minutes . ” <unk> Smallweed , who has been <unk> and shaking her head at the trivets , hearing figures mentioned , <unk> them with money and <unk> like a horrible old <unk> without any <unk> , “ Ten <unk> notes ! ” Grandfather Smallweed immediately throws the cushion at her .
“ <unk> you , be quiet ! ” says the good old man .
The effect of this act of <unk> is <unk> .
It not only <unk> up Mrs. Smallweed ’ s head against the side of her <unk> ’ s chair and causes her to present , when <unk> by her granddaughter , a highly <unk> state of cap , but the necessary exertion <unk> on Mr. Smallweed himself , whom it throws back into HIS <unk> ’ s chair like a broken <unk> .
The excellent old gentleman being at these times a mere <unk> with a black skull-cap on the top of it , does not present a very animated appearance until he has <unk> the two <unk> at the hands of his granddaughter of being shaken up like a great bottle and <unk> and <unk> like a great <unk> .
Some indication of a neck being developed in him by these means , he and the <unk> of his life ’ s evening again <unk> one another in their two <unk> ’ s chairs , like a couple of <unk> long forgotten on their post by the <unk> <unk> , Death .
Judy the <unk> is worthy company for these <unk> .
She is so <unk> sister to Mr. Smallweed the younger that the two <unk> into one would hardly make a young person of <unk> proportions , while she so happily <unk> the <unk> family likeness to the <unk> <unk> that <unk> in a <unk> <unk> and cap she might walk about the <unk> on the top of a <unk> without <unk> much remark as an unusual <unk> .
Under <unk> circumstances , however , she is dressed in a plain , spare gown of brown stuff .
Judy never <unk> a doll , never heard of <unk> , never played at any game .
She once or twice fell into children ’ s company when she was about ten years old , but the children couldn ’ t get on with Judy , and Judy couldn ’ t get on with them .
She seemed like an animal of another species , and there was <unk> <unk> on both sides .
It is very doubtful whether Judy knows how to laugh .
She has so rarely seen the thing done that the <unk> are strong the other way .
Of anything like a youthful laugh , she certainly can have no <unk> .
If she were to try one , she would find her teeth in her way , <unk> that action of her face , as she has unconsciously <unk> all its other expressions , on her pattern of <unk> age .
Such is Judy .
And her <unk> brother couldn ’ t wind up a top for his life .
He knows no more of <unk> the <unk> <unk> or of <unk> the <unk> than he knows of the people in the stars .
He could as soon play at <unk> or at <unk> as change into a <unk> or a <unk> himself .
But he is so much the better off than his sister that on his narrow world of fact an opening has <unk> into such <unk> regions as lie within the <unk> of Mr. Guppy .
Hence his admiration and his <unk> of that shining <unk> .
Judy , with a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , sets one of the <unk> <unk> on the table and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
The bread she puts on in an iron basket , and the butter ( and not much of it ) in a small <unk> plate .
Grandfather Smallweed looks hard after the tea as it is served out and asks Judy where the girl is .
“ Charley , do you mean ? ” says Judy .
“ Hey ? ” from Grandfather Smallweed .
“ Charley , do you mean ? ” This touches a spring in <unk> Smallweed , who , <unk> as usual at the trivets , cries , “ Over the water !
Charley over the water , Charley over the water , over the water to Charley , Charley over the water , over the water to Charley ! ” and becomes quite <unk> about it .
Grandfather looks at the cushion but has not sufficiently recovered his late exertion .
“ Ha ! ” he says when there is silence .
“ If that ’ s her name .
She <unk> a deal .
It would be better to allow her for her keep . ” Judy , with her brother ’ s wink , shakes her head and purses up her mouth into no without saying it .
“ No ? ” returns the old man .
“ Why not ? ” “ She ’ d want sixpence a day , and we can do it for less , ” says Judy .
“ <unk> ? ” Judy answers with a nod of deepest meaning and calls , as she <unk> the butter on the <unk> with every precaution against waste and <unk> it into <unk> , “ You , Charley , where are you ? ” <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , a little girl in a rough apron and a large bonnet , with her hands covered with soap and water and a <unk> brush in one of them , appears , and <unk> .
“ What work are you about now ? ” says Judy , making an ancient <unk> at her like a very sharp old <unk> .
“ I ’ m <unk> the upstairs back room , miss , ” replies Charley .
“ <unk> you do it thoroughly , and don ’ t <unk> .
<unk> won ’ t do for me .
Make haste !
Go along ! ” cries Judy with a stamp upon the ground .
“ You girls are more trouble than you ’ re worth , by half . ” On this severe <unk> , as she returns to her task of <unk> the butter and cutting the bread , falls the shadow of her brother , looking in at the window .
For whom , knife and <unk> in hand , she opens the <unk> .
“ Aye , aye , Bart ! ” says Grandfather Smallweed .
“ Here you are , <unk> ? ” “ Here I am , ” says <unk>
“ <unk> along with your friend again , Bart ? ” Small nods .
“ <unk> at his expense , Bart ? ” Small nods again .
“ That ’ s right .
<unk> at his expense as much as you can , and take warning by his foolish example .
That ’ s the use of such a friend .
The only use you can put him to , ” says the venerable <unk> .
His grandson , without receiving this good counsel as <unk> as he might , <unk> it with all such acceptance as may lie in a slight wink and a nod and takes a chair at the <unk> .
The four old faces then <unk> over <unk> like a company of <unk> <unk> , Mrs. Smallweed <unk> <unk> her head and chattering at the trivets and Mr. Smallweed <unk> to be repeatedly shaken up like a large black <unk> .
“ Yes , yes , ” says the good old gentleman , <unk> to his lesson of wisdom .
“ That ’ s such advice as your father would have given you , <unk>
You never saw your father .
More ’ s the pity .
He was my true son . ” Whether it is intended to be conveyed that he was particularly pleasant to look at , on that account , does not appear .
“ He was my true son , ” repeats the old gentleman , folding his bread and butter on his knee , “ a good <unk> , and died fifteen years ago . ” Mrs. Smallweed , following her usual <unk> , breaks out with “ <unk> hundred pound .
<unk> hundred pound in a black box , fifteen hundred pound locked up , fifteen hundred pound put away and hid ! ” Her worthy husband , setting aside his bread and butter , immediately <unk> the cushion at her , <unk> her against the side of her chair , and falls back in his own , overpowered .
His appearance , after <unk> Mrs. Smallweed with one of these <unk> , is particularly impressive and not wholly prepossessing , <unk> because the exertion generally <unk> his black skull-cap over one eye and gives him an air of <unk> <unk> , <unk> because he mutters violent <unk> against Mrs. Smallweed , and <unk> because the contrast between those powerful expressions and his <unk> figure is <unk> of a <unk> old <unk> who would be very wicked if he could .
All this , however , is so common in the Smallweed family circle that it produces no impression .
The old gentleman is merely shaken and has his <unk> feathers beaten up , the cushion is restored to its usual place beside him , and the old lady , perhaps with her cap <unk> and perhaps not , is planted in her chair again , ready to be <unk> down like a <unk> .
Some time <unk> in the present instance before the old gentleman is sufficiently cool to resume his discourse , and even then he <unk> it up with several <unk> <unk> addressed to the unconscious partner of his bosom , who holds communication with nothing on earth but the trivets .
As thus : “ If your father , Bart , had lived longer , he might have been worth a deal of money — you brimstone <unk> ! — but just as he was beginning to <unk> up the house that he had been making the <unk> for , through many a year — you <unk> of a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , what do you mean ! — he took ill and died of a low fever , always being a sparing and a spare man , full of business care — I should like to throw a cat at you instead of a cushion , and I will too if you make such a <unk> fool of yourself ! — and your mother , who was a prudent woman as dry as a <unk> , just <unk> away like <unk> after you and Judy were born — you are an old pig .
You are a brimstone pig .
You ’ re a head of <unk> ! ” Judy , not interested in what she has often heard , begins to <unk> in a <unk> various <unk> streams of tea , from the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and from the bottom of the <unk> for the little <unk> ’ s evening meal .
In like manner she gets together , in the iron <unk> , as many outside fragments and <unk> heels of <unk> as the <unk> <unk> of the house has left in existence .
“ But your father and me were <unk> , Bart , ” says the old gentleman , “ and when I am gone , you and Judy will have all there is .
It ’ s rare for you both that you went out early in life — Judy to the flower business , and you to the law .
You won ’ t want to spend it .
You ’ ll get your living without it , and put more to it .
When I am gone , Judy will go back to the flower business and you ’ ll still stick to the law . ” One might <unk> from Judy ’ s appearance that her business rather lay with the <unk> than the flowers , but she has in her time been <unk> to the art and mystery of <unk> <unk> .
A close <unk> might perhaps <unk> both in her eye and her brother ’ s , when their venerable <unk> <unk> his being gone , some little <unk> to know when he may be going , and some <unk> opinion that it is time he went .
“ Now , if everybody has done , ” says Judy , <unk> her preparations , “ I ’ ll have that girl in to her tea .
She would never leave off if she took it by herself in the kitchen . ” Charley is accordingly <unk> , and under a heavy fire of eyes , sits down to her <unk> and a <unk> ruin of bread and butter .
In the active <unk> of this young person , Judy Smallweed appears to <unk> a perfectly <unk> age and to date from the remotest periods .
Her <unk> manner of flying at her and <unk> on her , with or without pretence , whether or no , is wonderful , <unk> an <unk> in the art of <unk> seldom reached by the oldest practitioners .
“ Now , don ’ t stare about you all the afternoon , ” cries Judy , shaking her head and <unk> her foot as she happens to catch the glance which has been previously sounding the <unk> of tea , “ but take your <unk> and get back to your work . ” “ Yes , miss , ” says Charley .
“ Don ’ t say yes , ” returns Miss Smallweed , “ for I know what you girls are .
Do it without saying it , and then I may begin to believe you . ” Charley <unk> a great <unk> of tea in <unk> of <unk> and so <unk> the <unk> ruins that Miss Smallweed charges her not to <unk> , which “ in you girls , ” she observes , is <unk> .
Charley might find some more difficulty in meeting her views on the general subject of girls but for a knock at the door .
“ See who it is , and don ’ t <unk> when you open it ! ” cries Judy .
The object of her <unk> withdrawing for the purpose , Miss Smallweed takes that opportunity of <unk> the remainder of the bread and butter together and <unk> two or three dirty <unk> into the <unk> of the <unk> of tea as a hint that she considers the eating and drinking terminated .
“ Now !
Who is it , and what ’ s wanted ? ” says the <unk> Judy .
It is one Mr. George , it appears .
Without other announcement or ceremony , Mr. George walks in .
“ <unk> ! ” says Mr. George .
“ You are hot here .
Always a fire , eh ?
Well !
Perhaps you do right to get used to one . ” Mr. George makes the latter remark to himself as he nods to Grandfather Smallweed .
“ Ho !
It ’ s you ! ” cries the old gentleman .
“ How de do ?
How de do ? ” “ <unk> , ” replies Mr. George , taking a chair .
“ Your granddaughter I have had the honour of seeing before ; my service to you , miss . ” “ This is my grandson , ” says Grandfather Smallweed .
“ You ha ’ n ’ t seen him before .
He is in the law and not much at home . ” “ My service to him , too !
He is like his sister .
He is very like his sister .
He is <unk> like his sister , ” says Mr. George , laying a great and not altogether <unk> <unk> on his last <unk> .
“ And how does the world use you , Mr. George ? ” Grandfather Smallweed inquires , slowly rubbing his legs .
“ Pretty much as usual .
Like a <unk> . ” He is a <unk> brown man of fifty , well made , and good looking , with <unk> dark hair , bright eyes , and a broad chest .
His <unk> and powerful hands , as sunburnt as his face , have evidently been used to a pretty rough life .
What is curious about him is that he sits forward on his chair as if he were , from long habit , <unk> space for some dress or <unk> that he has altogether laid aside .
His step too is <unk> and heavy and would go well with a <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> .
He is <unk> now , but his mouth is set as if his upper lip had been for years familiar with a great <unk> ; and his manner of occasionally laying the open palm of his broad brown hand upon it is to the same effect .
<unk> one might guess Mr. George to have been a trooper once upon a time .
A special contrast Mr. George makes to the Smallweed family .
<unk> was never yet <unk> upon a household more unlike him .
It is a broadsword to an <unk> .
His developed figure and their <unk> forms , his large manner filling any amount of room and their little narrow pinched ways , his sounding voice and their sharp spare tones , are in the strongest and the <unk> opposition .
As he sits in the middle of the grim parlour , leaning a little forward , with his hands upon his <unk> and his elbows squared , he looks as though , if he remained there long , he would <unk> into himself the whole family and the whole <unk> house , extra little <unk> and all .
“ Do you rub your legs to rub life into ’ em ? ” he asks of Grandfather Smallweed after looking round the room .
“ Why , it ’ s partly a habit , Mr. George , and — yes — it partly <unk> the <unk> , ” he replies .
“ The <unk> ! ” repeats Mr. George , folding his arms upon his chest and seeming to become two <unk> larger .
“ Not much of that , I should think . ” “ Truly I ’ m old , Mr. George , ” says Grandfather Smallweed .
“ But I can carry my years .
I ’ m older than HER , ” nodding at his wife , “ and see what she is ?
You ’ re a brimstone <unk> ! ” with a sudden <unk> of his late <unk> .
“ <unk> old soul ! ” says Mr. George , turning his head in that direction .
“ Don ’ t <unk> the old lady .
Look at her here , with her poor cap half off her head and her poor hair all in a <unk> .
Hold up , ma ’ am .
That ’ s better .
There we are !
Think of your mother , Mr. Smallweed , ” says Mr. George , coming back to his seat from assisting her , “ if your wife an ’ t enough . ” “ I suppose you were an excellent son , Mr. George ? ” the old man <unk> with a <unk> .
The colour of Mr. George ’ s face rather <unk> as he replies , “ Why no .
I wasn ’ t . ” “ I am astonished at it . ” “ So am I. I ought to have been a good son , and I think I meant to have been one .
But I wasn ’ t .
I was a thundering bad son , that ’ s the long and the short of it , and never was a credit to anybody . ” “ <unk> ! ” cries the old man .
“ However , ” Mr. George resumes , “ the less said about it , the better now .
Come !
You know the agreement .
Always a pipe out of the two months ’ interest !
( <unk> !
It ’ s all correct .
You needn ’ t be afraid to order the pipe .
Here ’ s the new bill , and here ’ s the two months ’ <unk> , and a <unk> of a scrape it is to get it together in my business .
) ” Mr. George sits , with his arms folded , <unk> the family and the parlour while Grandfather Smallweed is assisted by Judy to two black <unk> cases out of a locked <unk> , in one of which he <unk> the document he has just received , and from the other takes another similar document which he hands to Mr. George , who <unk> it up for a <unk> .
As the old man <unk> , through his glasses , every <unk> and <unk> of both documents before he <unk> them from their <unk> prison , and as he <unk> the money three times over and requires Judy to say every word she utters at least twice , and is as <unk> slow of speech and action as it is possible to be , this business is a long time in progress .
When it is quite concluded , and not before , he <unk> his <unk> eyes and fingers from it and answers Mr. George ’ s last remark by saying , “ <unk> to order the pipe ?
We are not so <unk> as that , sir .
Judy , see directly to the pipe and the glass of cold <unk> for Mr. George . ” The <unk> <unk> , who have been looking straight before them all this time except when they have been <unk> by the black <unk> cases , retire together , generally disdainful of the visitor , but leaving him to the old man as two young <unk> might leave a <unk> to the <unk> bear .
“ And there you sit , I suppose , all the day long , eh ? ” says Mr. George with folded arms .
“ Just so , just so , ” the old man nods .
“ And don ’ t you occupy yourself at all ? ” “ I watch the fire — and the <unk> and the <unk> — ” “ When there is any , ” says Mr. George with great expression .
“ Just so .
When there is any . ” “ Don ’ t you read or get read to ? ” The old man shakes his head with sharp <unk> triumph .
“ No , no .
We have never been <unk> in our family .
It don ’ t pay .
<unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> .
No , no ! ” “ There ’ s not much to choose between your two states , ” says the visitor in a key too low for the old man ’ s dull hearing as he looks from him to the old woman and back again .
“ I say ! ” in a <unk> voice .
“ I hear you . ” “ You ’ ll sell me up at last , I suppose , when I am a day in <unk> . ” “ My dear friend ! ” cries Grandfather Smallweed , <unk> out both hands to embrace him .
“ Never !
Never , my dear friend !
But my friend in the city that I got to lend you the money — HE might ! ” “ Oh !
You can ’ t answer for him ? ” says Mr. George , finishing the inquiry in his lower key with the words “ You lying old <unk> ! ” “ My dear friend , he is not to be <unk> on .
I wouldn ’ t trust him .
He will have his bond , my dear friend . ” “ <unk> doubt him , ” says Mr. George .
Charley appearing with a tray , on which are the pipe , a small paper of tobacco , and the <unk> , he asks her , “ How do you come here !
You haven ’ t got the family face . ” “ I goes out to work , sir , ” returns Charley .
The trooper ( if trooper he be or have been ) takes her bonnet off , with a light touch for so strong a hand , and <unk> her on the head .
“ You give the house almost a wholesome look .
It wants a bit of youth as much as it wants fresh air . ” Then he <unk> her , lights his pipe , and drinks to Mr. Smallweed ’ s friend in the city — the one solitary flight of that esteemed old gentleman ’ s imagination .
“ So you think he might be hard upon me , eh ? ” “ I think he might — I am afraid he would .
I have known him do it , ” says Grandfather Smallweed <unk> , “ twenty times . ” <unk> , because his <unk> <unk> , who has been <unk> over the fire for some time , is instantly aroused and <unk> “ <unk> thousand pounds , twenty <unk> notes in a <unk> , twenty guineas , twenty million twenty <unk> <unk> , twenty — ” and is then cut short by the flying cushion , which the visitor , to whom this singular <unk> appears to be a novelty , <unk> from her face as it <unk> her in the usual manner .
“ You ’ re a brimstone <unk> .
You ’ re a <unk> — a brimstone <unk> !
You ’ re a <unk> <unk> .
You ’ re a chattering <unk> <unk> <unk> that ought to be burnt ! ” gasps the old man , <unk> in his chair .
“ My dear friend , will you shake me up a little ? ” Mr. George , who has been looking first at one of them and then at the other , as if he were <unk> , takes his venerable acquaintance by the throat on receiving this request , and dragging him upright in his chair as easily as if he were a doll , appears in two minds whether or no to shake all future power of <unk> out of him and shake him into his grave .
<unk> the <unk> , but <unk> him violently enough to make his head roll like a <unk> ’ s , he puts him <unk> down in his chair again and adjusts his skull-cap with such a rub that the old man winks with both eyes for a minute afterwards .
“ O Lord ! ” gasps Mr. Smallweed .
“ That ’ ll do .
Thank you , my dear friend , that ’ ll do .
Oh , dear me , I ’ m out of breath .
O Lord ! ” And Mr. Smallweed says it not without evident <unk> of his dear friend , who still stands over him <unk> larger than ever .
The <unk> presence , however , gradually <unk> into its chair and falls to smoking in long <unk> , <unk> itself with the <unk> reflection , “ The name of your friend in the city begins with a D , comrade , and you ’ re about right respecting the bond . ” “ Did you speak , Mr. George ? ” inquires the old man .
The trooper shakes his head , and leaning forward with his right elbow on his right knee and his pipe supported in that hand , while his other hand , resting on his left leg , <unk> his left elbow in a martial manner , continues to smoke .
Meanwhile he looks at Mr. Smallweed with grave attention and now and then <unk> the cloud of smoke away in order that he may see him the more clearly .
“ I take it , ” he says , making just as much and as little change in his position as will <unk> him to reach the glass to his lips with a round , full action , “ that I am the only man alive ( or dead either ) that gets the value of a pipe out of YOU ? ” “ Well , ” returns the old man , “ it ’ s true that I don ’ t see company , Mr. George , and that I don ’ t <unk> .
I can ’ t afford to it .
But as you , in your pleasant way , made your pipe a condition — ” “ Why , it ’ s not for the value of it ; that ’ s no great thing .
It was a fancy to get it out of you .
To have something in for my money . ” “ Ha !
You ’ re prudent , prudent , sir ! ” cries Grandfather Smallweed , rubbing his legs .
“ Very .
I always was . ” <unk> .
“ It ’ s a sure sign of my <unk> that I ever found the way here . ” <unk> .
“ Also , that I am what I am . ” <unk> .
“ I am well known to be prudent , ” says Mr. George , composedly smoking .
“ I rose in life that way . ” “ Don ’ t be <unk> , sir .
You may rise yet . ” Mr. George laughs and drinks .
“ Ha ’ n ’ t you no relations , now , ” asks Grandfather Smallweed with a <unk> in his eyes , “ who would pay off this little principal or who would lend you a good name or two that I could persuade my friend in the city to make you a further advance upon ?
Two good names would be sufficient for my friend in the city .
Ha ’ n ’ t you no such relations , Mr. George ? ” Mr. George , still composedly smoking , replies , “ If I had , I shouldn ’ t trouble them .
I have been trouble enough to my <unk> in my day .
It <unk> be a very good sort of <unk> in a vagabond , who has <unk> the best time of his life , to go back then to decent people that he never was a credit to and live upon them , but it ’ s not my sort .
The best kind of <unk> then for having gone away is to keep away , in my opinion . ” “ But natural affection , Mr. George , ” <unk> Grandfather Smallweed .
“ For two good names , <unk> ? ” says Mr. George , shaking his head and still composedly smoking .
“ No .
That ’ s not my sort either . ” Grandfather Smallweed has been gradually sliding down in his chair since his last <unk> and is now a bundle of clothes with a voice in it calling for Judy .
That <unk> , appearing , shakes him up in the usual manner and is charged by the old gentleman to remain near him .
For he seems <unk> of putting his visitor to the trouble of repeating his late <unk> .
“ Ha ! ” he observes when he is in <unk> again .
“ If you could have <unk> out the captain , Mr. George , it would have been the making of you .
If when you first came here , in consequence of our <unk> in the newspapers — when I say ‘ our , ’ I ’ m <unk> to the <unk> of my friend in the city , and one or two others who <unk> their capital in the same way , and are so friendly towards me as sometimes to give me a lift with my little <unk> — if at that time you could have helped us , Mr. George , it would have been the making of you . ” “ I was willing enough to be ‘ made , ’ as you call it , ” says Mr. George , smoking not quite so <unk> as before , for since the entrance of Judy he has been in some measure disturbed by a fascination , not of the admiring kind , which <unk> him to look at her as she stands by her grandfather ’ s chair , “ but on the whole , I am glad I wasn ’ t now . ” “ Why , Mr. George ?
In the name of — of brimstone , why ? ” says Grandfather Smallweed with a plain appearance of <unk> .
( <unk> apparently suggested by his eye lighting on Mrs. Smallweed in her <unk> . )
“ For two reasons , comrade . ” “ And what two reasons , Mr. George ?
In the name of the — ” “ Of our friend in the city ? ” suggests Mr. George , composedly drinking .
“ Aye , if you like .
What two reasons ? ” “ In the first place , ” returns Mr. George , but still looking at Judy as if she being so old and so like her grandfather it is indifferent which of the two he addresses , “ you gentlemen took me in .
You <unk> that Mr. Hawdon ( Captain Hawdon , if you hold to the saying ‘ Once a captain , always a captain ’ ) was to hear of something to his advantage . ” “ Well ? ” returns the old man <unk> and sharply .
“ Well ! ” says Mr. George , smoking on .
“ It wouldn ’ t have been much to his advantage to have been <unk> into prison by the whole bill and judgment trade of London . ” “ How do you know that ?
Some of his rich relations might have paid his <unk> or <unk> for ’ em .
Besides , he had taken <unk> in .
He owed us immense <unk> all round .
I would sooner have <unk> him than had no return .
If I sit here thinking of him , ” <unk> the old man , holding up his <unk> ten fingers , “ I want to <unk> him now . ” And in a sudden access of <unk> , he throws the cushion at the <unk> Mrs. Smallweed , but it passes <unk> on one side of her chair .
“ I don ’ t need to be told , ” returns the trooper , taking his pipe from his lips for a moment and carrying his eyes back from following the progress of the cushion to the <unk> which is burning low , “ that he carried on heavily and went to ruin .
I have been at his right hand many a day when he was <unk> upon ruin <unk> .
I was with him when he was sick and well , rich and poor .
I laid this hand upon him after he had run through everything and broken down everything beneath him — when he held a pistol to his head . ” “ I wish he had let it off , ” says the benevolent old man , “ and blown his head into as many pieces as he owed pounds ! ” “ That would have been a <unk> indeed , ” returns the trooper coolly ; “ any way , he had been young , hopeful , and handsome in the days gone by , and I am glad I never found him , when he was neither , to lead to a result so much to his advantage .
That ’ s reason number one . ” “ I hope number two ’ s as good ? ” <unk> the old man .
“ Why , no .
It ’ s more of a selfish reason .
If I had found him , I must have gone to the other world to look .
He was there . ” “ How do you know he was there ? ” “ He wasn ’ t here . ” “ How do you know he wasn ’ t here ? ” “ Don ’ t lose your temper as well as your money , ” says Mr. George , calmly knocking the ashes out of his pipe .
“ He was <unk> long before .
I am convinced of it .
He went over a ship ’ s side .
Whether <unk> or accidentally , I don ’ t know .
Perhaps your friend in the city does .
Do you know what that tune is , Mr. Smallweed ? ” he adds after breaking off to whistle one , accompanied on the table with the empty pipe .
“ <unk> ! ” replied the old man .
“ No .
We never have <unk> here . ” “ That ’ s the Dead <unk> in <unk> .
They <unk> <unk> to it , so it ’ s the natural end of the subject .
Now , if your pretty granddaughter — excuse me , miss — will <unk> to take care of this pipe for two months , we shall save the cost of one next time .
Good evening , Mr. Smallweed ! ” “ My dear friend ! ” the old man gives him both his hands .
“ So you think your friend in the city will be hard upon me if I fall in a <unk> ? ” says the trooper , looking down upon him like a giant .
“ My dear friend , I am afraid he will , ” returns the old man , looking up at him like a <unk> .
Mr. George laughs , and with a glance at Mr. Smallweed and a parting <unk> to the <unk> Judy , strides out of the parlour , <unk> imaginary <unk> and other <unk> <unk> as he goes .
“ You ’ re a <unk> <unk> , ” says the old gentleman , making a hideous <unk> at the door as he shuts it .
“ But I ’ ll <unk> you , you dog , I ’ ll <unk> you ! ” After this amiable remark , his spirit <unk> into those <unk> regions of reflection which its education and pursuits have opened to it , and again he and Mrs. Smallweed while away the rosy hours , two <unk> <unk> forgotten as aforesaid by the <unk> <unk> .
While the <unk> are faithful to their post , Mr. George strides through the streets with a massive kind of <unk> and a <unk> face .
It is eight o ’ clock now , and the day is fast drawing in .
He stops hard by <unk> <unk> and reads a <unk> , <unk> to go to <unk> ’ s <unk> .
Being there , is much delighted with the horses and the <unk> of strength ; looks at the weapons with a <unk> eye ; <unk> of the <unk> as giving <unk> of <unk> <unk> ; but is touched home by the sentiments .
In the last scene , when the <unk> of <unk> gets up into a cart and <unk> to bless the united <unk> by hovering over them with the <unk> <unk> , his <unk> are <unk> with emotion .
The theatre over , Mr. George comes across the water again and makes his way to that curious region lying about the <unk> and Leicester Square which is a centre of attraction to indifferent foreign <unk> and indifferent <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , old <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and a large <unk> of <unk> and <unk> out of sight .
<unk> to the heart of this region , he arrives by a court and a long whitewashed passage at a great brick building composed of bare walls , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , on the front of which , if it can be said to have any front , is painted <unk> ’ S <unk> <unk> , &amp; c . Into George ’ s Shooting Gallery , &amp; c . , he goes ; and in it there are <unk> ( partly turned off now ) , and two whitened <unk> for <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and all <unk> for the British art of <unk> .
None of these <unk> or <unk> being pursued in George ’ s Shooting Gallery to-night , which is so devoid of company that a little <unk> man with a large head has it all to himself and lies asleep upon the floor .
The little man is dressed something like a <unk> , in a <unk> apron and cap ; and his face and hands are dirty with gunpowder and <unk> with the <unk> of guns .
As he lies in the light before a <unk> white <unk> , the black upon him shines again .
Not far off is the strong , rough , <unk> table with a <unk> upon it at which he has been working .
He is a little man with a face all crushed together , who appears , from a certain blue and <unk> appearance that one of his cheeks presents , to have been blown up , in the way of business , at some odd time or times .
“ Phil ! ” says the trooper in a quiet voice .
“ All right ! ” cries Phil , <unk> to his feet .
“ Anything been doing ? ” “ <unk> as ever so much <unk> , ” says Phil .
“ <unk> dozen <unk> and a dozen pistol .
As to <unk> ! ” Phil gives a <unk> at the recollection .
“ <unk> up shop , Phil ! ” As Phil moves about to execute this order , it appears that he is lame , though able to move very quickly .
On the <unk> side of his face he has no eyebrow , and on the other side he has a <unk> black one , which want of <unk> gives him a very singular and rather <unk> appearance .
Everything seems to have happened to his hands that could possibly take place <unk> with the <unk> of all the fingers , for they are <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> all over .
He appears to be very strong and lifts heavy <unk> about as if he had no idea what weight was .
He has a curious way of <unk> round the gallery with his shoulder against the wall and <unk> off at objects he wants to lay hold of instead of going straight to them , which has left a <unk> all round the four walls , <unk> called “ Phil ’ s mark . ” This <unk> of George ’ s Gallery in George ’ s absence concludes his proceedings , when he has locked the great doors and turned out all the lights but one , which he leaves to <unk> , by dragging out from a wooden <unk> in a corner two <unk> and <unk> .
These being drawn to opposite ends of the gallery , the trooper makes his own bed and Phil makes his .
“ Phil ! ” says the master , walking towards him without his coat and waistcoat , and looking more soldierly than ever in his <unk> .
“ You were found in a doorway , <unk> ’ t you ? ” “ <unk> , ” says Phil .
“ <unk> tumbled over me . ” “ Then <unk> came natural to YOU from the beginning . ” “ As nat ’ <unk> as possible , ” says Phil .
“ Good night ! ” “ Good night , guv ’ ner . ” Phil cannot even go straight to bed , but finds it necessary to shoulder round two sides of the gallery and then <unk> off at his <unk> .
The trooper , after taking a turn or two in the <unk> and looking up at the moon now shining through the <unk> , strides to his own <unk> by a <unk> <unk> and goes to bed too .
CHAPTER <unk> Mr. Bucket Allegory looks pretty cool in Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields , though the evening is hot , for both Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s windows are wide open , and the room is lofty , <unk> , and gloomy .
These may not be desirable <unk> when November comes with fog and sleet or <unk> with <unk> and snow , but they have their merits in the <unk> long vacation weather .
They <unk> Allegory , though it has cheeks like <unk> , and knees like <unk> of <unk> , and rosy <unk> for <unk> to its legs and <unk> to its arms , to look tolerably cool to-night .
<unk> of dust comes in at Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s windows , and plenty more has <unk> among his furniture and papers .
It lies thick everywhere .
When a <unk> from the country that has lost its way takes fright and makes a blind hurry to rush out again , it <unk> as much dust in the eyes of Allegory as the law — or Mr. Tulkinghorn , one of its <unk> <unk> — may <unk> , on occasion , in the eyes of the <unk> .
In his lowering <unk> of dust , the <unk> article into which his papers and himself , and all his clients , and all things of earth , <unk> and <unk> , are <unk> , Mr. Tulkinghorn sits at one of the open windows enjoying a bottle of old <unk> .
Though a <unk> man , close , dry , and silent , he can enjoy old wine with the best .
He has a <unk> <unk> of <unk> in some artful cellar under the Fields , which is one of his many secrets .
When he <unk> alone in chambers , as he has <unk> to-day , and has his bit of fish and his <unk> or <unk> brought in from the <unk> , he <unk> with a candle to the echoing regions below the deserted mansion , and <unk> by a remote <unk> of thundering doors , comes gravely back <unk> by an <unk> atmosphere and carrying a bottle from which he <unk> a radiant <unk> , two score and ten years old , that <unk> in the glass to find itself so famous and fills the whole room with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Mr. Tulkinghorn , sitting in the twilight by the open window , <unk> his wine .
As if it whispered to him of its fifty years of silence and <unk> , it shuts him up the closer .
More <unk> than ever , he sits , and drinks , and <unk> as it were in secrecy , pondering at that twilight hour on all the mysteries he knows , associated with darkening woods in the country , and vast blank <unk> houses in town , and perhaps sparing a thought or two for himself , and his family history , and his money , and his will — all a mystery to every one — and that one <unk> friend of his , a man of the same <unk> and a lawyer too , who lived the same kind of life until he was <unk> years old , and then suddenly <unk> ( as it is supposed ) an impression that it was too monotonous , gave his gold watch to his <unk> one summer evening and walked leisurely home to the Temple and hanged himself .
But Mr. Tulkinghorn is not alone to-night to <unk> at his usual length .
<unk> at the same table , though with his chair modestly and <unk> drawn a little way from it , sits a bald , mild , shining man who coughs respectfully behind his hand when the lawyer <unk> him fill his glass .
“ Now , Snagsby , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “ to go over this odd story again . ” “ If you please , sir . ” “ You told me when you were so good as to step round here last night — ” “ For which I must ask you to excuse me if it was a liberty , sir ; but I remember that you had taken a sort of an interest in that person , and I thought it possible that you might — just — wish — to — ” Mr. Tulkinghorn is not the man to help him to any conclusion or to admit anything as to any possibility concerning himself .
So Mr. Snagsby <unk> off into saying , with an awkward cough , “ I must ask you to excuse the liberty , sir , I am sure . ” “ Not at all , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ You told me , Snagsby , that you put on your hat and came round without mentioning your intention to your wife .
That was prudent I think , because it ’ s not a matter of such importance that it requires to be mentioned . ” “ Well , sir , ” returns Mr. Snagsby , “ you see , my little woman is — not to put too fine a point upon it — inquisitive .
She ’ s inquisitive .
Poor little thing , she ’ s liable to <unk> , and it ’ s good for her to have her mind employed .
In consequence of which she <unk> it — I should say upon every individual thing she can lay hold of , whether it concerns her or not — especially not .
My little woman has a very active mind , sir . ” Mr. Snagsby drinks and murmurs with an admiring cough behind his hand , “ Dear me , very fine wine indeed ! ” “ Therefore you kept your visit to yourself last night ? ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ And to-night too ? ” “ Yes , sir , and to-night , too .
My little woman is at present in — not to put too fine a point on it — in a <unk> state , or in what she considers such , and <unk> the <unk> <unk> ( which is the name they go by ) of a reverend party of the name of Chadband .
He has a great deal of eloquence at his command , undoubtedly , but I am not quite favourable to his style myself .
That ’ s neither here nor there .
My little woman being engaged in that way made it easier for me to step round in a quiet manner . ” Mr. Tulkinghorn <unk> .
“ <unk> your glass , Snagsby . ” “ Thank you , sir , I am sure , ” returns the stationer with his cough of deference .
“ This is wonderfully fine wine , sir ! ” “ It is a rare wine now , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ It is fifty years old . ” “ Is it indeed , sir ?
But I am not surprised to hear it , I am sure .
It might be — any age almost . ” After rendering this general tribute to the <unk> , Mr. Snagsby in his modesty coughs an apology behind his hand for drinking anything so precious .
“ Will you run over , once again , what the boy said ? ” asks Mr. Tulkinghorn , putting his hands into the pockets of his rusty <unk> and leaning quietly back in his chair .
“ With pleasure , sir . ” Then , with fidelity , though with some <unk> , the law-stationer repeats Jo ’ s <unk> made to the assembled guests at his house .
On coming to the end of his narrative , he gives a great start and breaks off with , “ Dear me , sir , I wasn ’ t aware there was any other gentleman present ! ” Mr. Snagsby is <unk> to see , standing with an attentive face between himself and the lawyer at a little distance from the table , a person with a hat and stick in his hand who was not there when he himself came in and has not since entered by the door or by either of the windows .
There is a press in the room , but its <unk> have not <unk> , nor has a step been audible upon the floor .
Yet this third person stands there with his attentive face , and his hat and stick in his hands , and his hands behind him , a composed and quiet <unk> .
He is a <unk> built , <unk> , <unk> man in black , of about the <unk> .
Except that he looks at Mr. Snagsby as if he were going to take his portrait , there is nothing remarkable about him at first sight but his ghostly manner of appearing .
“ Don ’ t mind this gentleman , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn in his quiet way .
“ This is only Mr. Bucket . ” “ Oh , indeed , sir ? ” returns the stationer , expressing by a cough that he is quite in the dark as to who Mr. Bucket may be .
“ I wanted him to hear this story , ” says the lawyer , “ because I have half a mind ( for a reason ) to know more of it , and he is very intelligent in such things .
What do you say to this , Bucket ? ” “ It ’ s very plain , sir .
Since our people have moved this boy on , and he ’ s not to be found on his old lay , if Mr. Snagsby don ’ t object to go down with me to Tom-all-Alone ’ s and point him out , we can have him here in less than a couple of hours ’ time .
I can do it without Mr. Snagsby , of course , but this is the <unk> way . ” “ Mr.
Bucket is a <unk> officer , Snagsby , ” says the lawyer in explanation .
“ Is he indeed , sir ? ” says Mr. Snagsby with a strong <unk> in his <unk> of hair to stand on end .
“ And if you have no real objection to accompany Mr. Bucket to the place in question , ” pursues the lawyer , “ I shall feel obliged to you if you will do so . ” In a moment ’ s hesitation on the part of Mr. Snagsby , Bucket <unk> down to the bottom of his mind .
“ Don ’ t you be afraid of hurting the boy , ” he says .
“ You won ’ t do that .
It ’ s all right as far as the boy ’ s concerned .
We shall only bring him here to ask him a question or so I want to put to him , and he ’ ll be paid for his trouble and sent away again .
It ’ ll be a good job for him .
I promise you , as a man , that you shall see the boy sent away all right .
Don ’ t you be afraid of hurting him ; you an ’ t going to do that . ” “ Very well , Mr. Tulkinghorn ! ” cries Mr. Snagsby cheerfully .
And reassured , “ Since that ’ s the case — ” “ Yes !
And <unk> here , Mr. Snagsby , ” resumes Bucket , taking him aside by the arm , tapping him <unk> on the breast , and speaking in a confidential tone .
“ You ’ re a man of the world , you know , and a man of business , and a man of sense .
That ’ s what YOU are . ” “ I am sure I am much obliged to you for your good opinion , ” returns the stationer with his cough of modesty , “ but — ” “ That ’ s what YOU are , you know , ” says Bucket .
“ Now , it an ’ t necessary to say to a man like you , engaged in your business , which is a business of trust and requires a person to be wide awake and have his senses about him and his head <unk> on tight ( I had an uncle in your business once ) — it an ’ t necessary to say to a man like you that it ’ s the best and <unk> way to keep little matters like this quiet .
Don ’ t you see ?
<unk> ! ” “ Certainly , certainly , ” returns the other .
“ I don ’ t mind telling YOU , ” says Bucket with an engaging appearance of <unk> , “ that as far as I can understand it , there seems to be a doubt whether this dead person wasn ’ t <unk> to a little property , and whether this female hasn ’ t been up to some games respecting that property , don ’ t you see ? ” “ Oh ! ” says Mr. Snagsby , but not appearing to see quite distinctly .
“ Now , what YOU want , ” pursues Bucket , again tapping Mr. Snagsby on the breast in a comfortable and <unk> manner , “ is that every person should have their rights according to justice .
That ’ s what YOU want . ” “ To be sure , ” returns Mr. Snagsby with a nod .
“ On account of which , and at the same time to oblige a — do you call it , in your business , customer or client ?
I forget how my uncle used to call it . ” “ Why , I generally say customer myself , ” replies Mr. Snagsby .
“ You ’ re right ! ” returns Mr. Bucket , shaking hands with him quite affectionately .
“ — On account of which , and at the same time to oblige a real good customer , you mean to go down with me , in confidence , to Tom-all-Alone ’ s and to keep the whole thing quiet ever afterwards and never mention it to any one .
That ’ s about your intentions , if I understand you ? ” “ You are right , sir .
You are right , ” says Mr. Snagsby .
“ Then here ’ s your hat , ” returns his new friend , quite as <unk> with it as if he had made it ; “ and if you ’ re ready , I am . ” They leave Mr. Tulkinghorn , without a <unk> on the surface of his <unk> <unk> , drinking his old wine , and go down into the streets .
“ You don ’ t happen to know a very good sort of person of the name of Gridley , do you ? ” says Bucket in friendly <unk> as they <unk> the stairs .
“ No , ” says Mr. Snagsby , considering , “ I don ’ t know anybody of that name .
Why ? ” “ Nothing particular , ” says Bucket ; “ only having allowed his temper to get a little the better of him and having been threatening some respectable people , he is keeping out of the way of a <unk> I have got against him — which it ’ s a pity that a man of sense should do . ” As they walk along , Mr. Snagsby observes , as a novelty , that however quick their pace may be , his companion still seems in some <unk> manner to <unk> and <unk> ; also , that whenever he is going to turn to the right or left , he <unk> to have a fixed purpose in his mind of going straight <unk> , and wheels off , sharply , at the very last moment .
Now and then , when they pass a <unk> on his beat , Mr. Snagsby <unk> that both the constable and his guide fall into a deep <unk> as they come towards each other , and appear entirely to <unk> each other , and to gaze into space .
In a few <unk> , Mr. Bucket , coming behind some <unk> young man with a shining hat on , and his <unk> hair twisted into one flat <unk> on each side of his head , almost without glancing at him touches him with his stick , upon which the young man , looking round , instantly <unk> .
For the most part Mr. Bucket <unk> things in general , with a face as <unk> as the great mourning ring on his little finger or the <unk> , composed of not much <unk> and a good deal of setting , which he wears in his <unk> .
When they come at last to Tom-all-Alone ’ s , Mr. Bucket stops for a moment at the corner and takes a lighted bull ’ <unk> from the constable on duty there , who then accompanies him with his own particular bull ’ <unk> at his waist .
Between his two <unk> , Mr. Snagsby passes along the middle of a <unk> street , <unk> , <unk> , deep in black mud and <unk> water — though the roads are dry elsewhere — and <unk> with such <unk> and <unk> that he , who has lived in London all his life , can <unk> believe his senses .
<unk> from this street and its heaps of ruins are other streets and courts so <unk> that Mr. Snagsby <unk> in body and mind and feels as if he were going every moment deeper down into the infernal <unk> .
“ Draw off a bit here , Mr. Snagsby , ” says Bucket as a kind of shabby <unk> is borne towards them , surrounded by a <unk> crowd .
“ Here ’ s the fever coming up the street ! ” As the <unk> wretch goes by , the crowd , leaving that object of attraction , <unk> round the three visitors like a dream of horrible faces and <unk> away up <unk> and into ruins and behind walls , and with occasional cries and shrill whistles of warning , <unk> <unk> about them until they leave the place .
“ Are those the <unk> , <unk> ? ” Mr. Bucket coolly asks as he turns his bull ’ <unk> on a line of <unk> ruins .
<unk> replies that “ all them are , ” and further that in all , for months and months , the people “ have been down by <unk> ” and have been carried out dead and dying “ like sheep with the <unk> . ” Bucket observing to Mr. Snagsby as they go on again that he looks a little poorly , Mr. Snagsby answers that he feels as if he couldn ’ t breathe the dreadful air .
There is inquiry made at various houses for a boy named Jo .
As few people are known in Tom-all-Alone ’ s by any Christian sign , there is much reference to Mr. Snagsby whether he means <unk> , or the <unk> , or <unk> , or Young <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , or the <unk> .
Mr. Snagsby <unk> over and over again .
There are <unk> opinions respecting the original of his picture .
Some think it must be <unk> , some say the <unk> .
The <unk> is produced , but is not at all near the thing .
Whenever Mr. Snagsby and his <unk> are <unk> , the crowd <unk> round , and from its <unk> <unk> <unk> advice <unk> up to Mr. Bucket .
Whenever they move , and the angry bull ’ <unk> glare , it <unk> away and <unk> about them up the <unk> , and in the ruins , and behind the walls , as before .
At last there is a <unk> found out where <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> , lays him down at night ; and it is thought that the <unk> <unk> may be Jo .
<unk> of notes between Mr. Snagsby and the <unk> of the house — a <unk> face tied up in a black bundle , and <unk> out of a heap of rags on the floor of a <unk> which is her private apartment — leads to the establishment of this conclusion .
<unk> has gone to the doctor ’ s to get a bottle of stuff for a sick woman but will be here <unk> .
“ And who have we got here to-night ? ” says Mr. Bucket , opening another door and <unk> in with his bull ’ <unk> .
“ Two <unk> men , eh ?
And two women ?
The men are sound enough , ” turning back each <unk> ’ s arm from his face to look at him .
“ Are these your good men , my dears ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” returns one of the women .
“ They are our husbands . ” “ <unk> , eh ? ” “ Yes , sir . ” “ What are you doing here ?
You don ’ t belong to London . ” “ No , sir .
We belong to <unk> . ” “ <unk> in <unk> ? ” “ Saint Albans . ” “ Come up on the <unk> ? ” “ We walked up yesterday .
There ’ s no work down with us at present , but we have done no good by coming here , and shall do none , I expect . ” “ That ’ s not the way to do much good , ” says Mr. Bucket , turning his head in the direction of the unconscious figures on the ground .
“ It an ’ t indeed , ” replies the woman with a sigh .
“ Jenny and me knows it full well . ” The room , though two or three feet higher than the door , is so low that the head of the <unk> of the visitors would touch the blackened ceiling if he stood upright .
It is offensive to every sense ; even the <unk> candle <unk> pale and <unk> in the <unk> air .
There are a couple of <unk> and a higher bench by way of table .
The men lie asleep where they <unk> down , but the women sit by the candle .
<unk> in the arms of the woman who has spoken is a very young child .
“ Why , what age do you call that little creature ? ” says Bucket .
“ It looks as if it was born yesterday . ” He is not at all rough about it ; and as he turns his light gently on the infant , Mr. Snagsby is strangely reminded of another infant , <unk> with light , that he has seen in pictures .
“ He is not three weeks old yet , sir , ” says the woman .
“ Is he your child ? ” “ Mine . ” The other woman , who was bending over it when they came in , <unk> down again and kisses it as it lies asleep .
“ You seem as fond of it as if you were the mother yourself , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ I was the mother of one like it , master , and it died . ” “ Ah , Jenny , Jenny ! ” says the other woman to her .
“ Better so .
Much better to think of dead than alive , Jenny !
Much better ! ” “ Why , you an ’ t such an unnatural woman , I hope , ” returns Bucket sternly , “ as to wish your own child dead ? ” “ God knows you are right , master , ” she returns .
“ I am not .
I ’ d stand between it and death with my own life if I could , as true as any pretty lady . ” “ Then don ’ t talk in that wrong manner , ” says Mr. Bucket , <unk> again .
“ Why do you do it ? ” “ It ’ s brought into my head , master , ” returns the woman , her eyes filling with tears , “ when I look down at the child lying so .
If it was never to wake no more , you ’ d think me mad , I should take on so .
I know that very well .
I was with Jenny when she lost hers — warn ’ t I , Jenny ? — and I know how she grieved .
But look around you at this place .
Look at them , ” glancing at the <unk> on the ground .
“ Look at the boy you ’ re waiting for , who ’ s gone out to do me a good turn .
Think of the children that your business lays with often and often , and that YOU see grow up ! ” “ Well , well , ” says Mr. Bucket , “ you train him respectable , and he ’ ll be a comfort to you , and look after you in your old age , you know . ” “ I mean to try hard , ” she answers , wiping her eyes .
“ But I have been <unk> , being <unk> to-night and not well with the <unk> , of all the many things that ’ ll come in his way .
My master will be against it , and he ’ ll be beat , and see me beat , and made to fear his home , and perhaps to stray wild .
If I work for him ever so much , and ever so hard , there ’ s no one to help me ; and if he should be turned bad ‘ spite of all I could do , and the time should come when I should sit by him in his sleep , made hard and changed , an ’ t it likely I should think of him as he lies in my lap now and wish he had died as Jenny ’ s child died ! ” “ There , there ! ” says Jenny .
“ Liz , you ’ re tired and ill . Let me take him . ” In doing so , she <unk> the mother ’ s dress , but quickly <unk> it over the wounded and <unk> bosom where the baby has been lying .
“ It ’ s my dead child , ” says Jenny , walking up and down as she <unk> , “ that makes me love this child so dear , and it ’ s my dead child that makes her love it so dear too , as even to think of its being taken away from her now .
While she thinks that , I think what fortune would I give to have my darling back .
But we mean the same thing , if we knew how to say it , us two mothers does in our poor hearts ! ” As Mr. Snagsby blows his nose and coughs his cough of sympathy , a step is heard without .
Mr. Bucket throws his light into the doorway and says to Mr. Snagsby , “ Now , what do you say to <unk> ?
Will HE do ? ” “ That ’ s Jo , ” says Mr. Snagsby .
Jo stands amazed in the <unk> of light , like a ragged figure in a <unk> , trembling to think that he has offended against the law in not having moved on far enough .
Mr. Snagsby , however , giving him the <unk> assurance , “ It ’ s only a job you will be paid for , Jo , ” he recovers ; and on being taken outside by Mr. Bucket for a little private <unk> , tells his <unk> <unk> , though out of breath .
“ I have squared it with the lad , ” says Mr. Bucket , returning , “ and it ’ s all right .
Now , Mr. Snagsby , we ’ re ready for you . ” First , Jo has to complete his errand of good nature by <unk> over the <unk> he has been to get , which he delivers with the <unk> <unk> direction that “ it ’ s to be all took d ’ <unk> . ” Secondly , Mr. Snagsby has to lay upon the table half a crown , his usual <unk> for an immense variety of <unk> .
<unk> , Mr. Bucket has to take Jo by the arm a little above the elbow and walk him on before him , without which <unk> neither the <unk> <unk> nor any other <unk> could be professionally conducted to Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields .
These arrangements completed , they give the women good night and come out once more into black and foul Tom-all-Alone ’ s .
By the <unk> ways through which they <unk> into that pit , they gradually <unk> from it , the crowd <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> about them until they come to the <unk> , where <unk> of the bull ’ <unk> is made to <unk> .
Here the crowd , like a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , turns back , <unk> , and is seen no more .
Through the clearer and <unk> streets , never so clear and fresh to Mr. Snagsby ’ s mind as now , they walk and ride until they come to Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s gate .
As they <unk> the dim stairs ( Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s chambers being on the first floor ) , Mr. Bucket <unk> that he has the key of the outer door in his pocket and that there is no need to ring .
For a man so <unk> in most things of that kind , Bucket takes time to open the door and makes some noise too .
It may be that he sounds a note of preparation .
<unk> , they come at last into the hall , where a lamp is burning , and so into Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s usual room — the room where he <unk> his old wine to-night .
He is not there , but his two old-fashioned candlesticks are , and the room is tolerably light .
Mr. Bucket , still having his professional hold of Jo and appearing to Mr. Snagsby to possess an <unk> number of eyes , makes a little way into this room , when Jo starts and stops .
“ What ’ s the matter ? ” says Bucket in a whisper .
“ There she is ! ” cries Jo .
“ Who ! ” “ The lady ! ” A female figure , closely <unk> , stands in the middle of the room , where the light falls upon it .
It is quite still and silent .
The front of the figure is towards them , but it takes no notice of their entrance and remains like a <unk> .
“ Now , tell me , ” says Bucket aloud , “ how you know that to be the lady . ” “ I know the wale , ” replies Jo , staring , “ and the bonnet , and the gownd . ” “ Be quite sure of what you say , <unk> , ” returns Bucket , <unk> observant of him .
“ Look again . ” “ I am <unk> as hard as ever I can look , ” says Jo with starting eyes , “ and that there ’ s the wale , the bonnet , and the gownd . ” “ What about those rings you told me of ? ” asks Bucket .
“ <unk> all over here , ” says Jo , rubbing the fingers of his left hand on the knuckles of his right without taking his eyes from the figure .
The figure <unk> the <unk> glove and shows the hand .
“ Now , what do you say to that ? ” asks Bucket .
Jo shakes his head .
“ Not rings a bit like them .
Not a hand like that . ” “ What are you talking of ? ” says Bucket , evidently pleased though , and well pleased too .
“ <unk> was a deal <unk> , a deal <unk> , and a deal smaller , ” returns Jo .
“ Why , you ’ ll tell me I ’ m my own mother next , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Do you recollect the lady ’ s voice ? ” “ I think I does , ” says Jo .
The figure speaks .
“ Was it at all like this ?
I will speak as long as you like if you are not sure .
Was it this voice , or at all like this voice ? ” Jo looks <unk> at Mr. Bucket .
“ Not a bit ! ” “ Then , what , ” retorts that worthy , pointing to the figure , “ did you say it was the lady for ? ” “ <unk> , ” says Jo with a perplexed stare but without being at all shaken in his certainty , “ <unk> that there ’ s the wale , the bonnet , and the gownd .
It is her and it an ’ t her .
It an ’ t her hand , nor yet her rings , nor yet her <unk> .
But that there ’ s the wale , the bonnet , and the gownd , and they ’ re wore the same way wot she wore ’ em , and it ’ s her height wot she wos , and she giv me a <unk> ’ ring and <unk> it . ” “ Well ! ” says Mr. Bucket slightly , “ we haven ’ t got much good out of YOU .
But , however , here ’ s five shillings for you .
Take care how you spend it , and don ’ t get yourself into trouble . ” Bucket <unk> tells the <unk> from one hand into the other like <unk> — which is a way he has , his principal use of them being in these games of skill — and then puts them , in a little pile , into the boy ’ s hand and takes him out to the door , leaving Mr. Snagsby , not by any means comfortable under these mysterious circumstances , alone with the <unk> figure .
But on Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s coming into the room , the veil is raised and a sufficiently <unk> Frenchwoman is revealed , though her expression is something of the <unk> .
“ Thank you , Mademoiselle Hortense , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn with his usual <unk> .
“ I will give you no further trouble about this little wager . ” “ You will do me the kindness to remember , sir , that I am not at present placed ? ” says mademoiselle .
“ Certainly , certainly ! ” “ And to confer upon me the favour of your distinguished <unk> ? ” “ By all means , Mademoiselle Hortense . ” “ A word from Mr. Tulkinghorn is so powerful . ” “ It shall not be wanting , mademoiselle . ” “ <unk> the assurance of my devoted gratitude , dear sir . ” “ Good night . ” Mademoiselle goes out with an air of native <unk> ; and Mr. Bucket , to whom it is , on an <unk> , as natural to be <unk> of the <unk> as it is to be anything else , shows her downstairs , not without gallantry .
“ Well , Bucket ? ” quoth Mr. Tulkinghorn on his return .
“ It ’ s all squared , you see , as I squared it myself , sir .
There an ’ t a doubt that it was the other one with this one ’ s dress on .
The boy was exact respecting colours and everything .
Mr. Snagsby , I promised you as a man that he should be sent away all right .
Don ’ t say it wasn ’ t done ! ” “ You have kept your word , sir , ” returns the stationer ; “ and if I can be of no further use , Mr. Tulkinghorn , I think , as my little woman will be getting anxious — ” “ Thank you , Snagsby , no further use , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ I am quite <unk> to you for the trouble you have taken already . ” “ Not at all , sir .
I wish you good night . ” “ You see , Mr. Snagsby , ” says Mr. Bucket , <unk> him to the door and shaking hands with him over and over again , “ what I like in you is that you ’ re a man it ’ s of no use <unk> ; that ’ s what YOU are .
When you know you have done a right thing , you put it away , and it ’ s done with and gone , and there ’ s an end of it .
That ’ s what YOU do . ” “ That is certainly what I endeavour to do , sir , ” returns Mr. Snagsby .
“ No , you don ’ t do yourself justice .
It an ’ t what you endeavour to do , ” says Mr. Bucket , shaking hands with him and blessing him in the <unk> manner , “ it ’ s what you DO .
That ’ s what I <unk> in a man in your way of business . ” Mr. Snagsby makes a suitable <unk> and goes <unk> so confused by the events of the evening that he is doubtful of his being awake and out — doubtful of the reality of the streets through which he goes — doubtful of the reality of the moon that shines above him .
He is presently reassured on these subjects by the <unk> reality of Mrs. Snagsby , sitting up with her head in a perfect <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , who has <unk> Guster to the <unk> with official intelligence of her husband ’ s being made away with , and who within the last two hours has passed through every stage of <unk> with the greatest <unk> .
But as the little woman feelingly says , many thanks she gets for it !
CHAPTER <unk> Esther ’ s Narrative We came home from Mr. Boythorn ’ s after six pleasant weeks .
We were often in the park and in the woods and seldom passed the lodge where we had taken shelter without looking in to speak to the keeper ’ s wife ; but we saw no more of Lady Dedlock , except at church on Sundays .
There was company at Chesney Wold ; and although several beautiful faces surrounded her , her face <unk> the same influence on me as at first .
I do not quite know even now whether it was painful or <unk> , whether it drew me towards her or made me <unk> from her .
I think I admired her with a kind of fear , and I know that in her presence my thoughts always wandered back , as they had done at first , to that old time of my life .
I had a fancy , on more than one of these Sundays , that what this lady so curiously was to me , I was to her — I mean that I disturbed her thoughts as she <unk> mine , though in some different way .
But when I <unk> a glance at her and saw her so composed and distant and <unk> , I felt this to be a foolish weakness .
Indeed , I felt the whole state of my mind in reference to her to be weak and unreasonable , and I remonstrated with myself about it as much as I could .
One <unk> that occurred before we <unk> Mr. Boythorn ’ s house , I had better mention in this place .
I was walking in the garden with Ada when I was told that some one wished to see me .
Going into the <unk> where this person was waiting , I found it to be the French maid who had cast off her shoes and walked through the wet grass on the day when it <unk> and <unk> .
“ Mademoiselle , ” she began , looking fixedly at me with her <unk> eyes , though otherwise <unk> an agreeable appearance and speaking neither with <unk> nor <unk> , “ I have taken a great liberty in coming here , but you know how to excuse it , being so amiable , mademoiselle . ” “ No excuse is necessary , ” I returned , “ if you wish to speak to me . ” “ That is my desire , mademoiselle .
A thousand thanks for the permission .
I have your leave to speak .
Is it not ? ” she said in a quick , natural way .
“ Certainly , ” said I.
“ Mademoiselle , you are so amiable !
Listen then , if you please .
I have left my Lady .
We could not agree .
My Lady is so high , so very high .
Pardon !
Mademoiselle , you are right ! ” Her quickness anticipated what I might have said presently but as yet had only thought .
“ It is not for me to come here to complain of my Lady .
But I say she is so high , so very high .
I will not say a word more .
All the world knows that . ” “ Go on , if you please , ” said I.
“ <unk> ; mademoiselle , I am thankful for your politeness .
Mademoiselle , I have an <unk> desire to find service with a young lady who is good , accomplished , beautiful .
You are good , accomplished , and beautiful as an angel .
Ah , could I have the honour of being your domestic ! ” “ I am sorry — ” I began .
“ Do not dismiss me so soon , mademoiselle ! ” she said with an <unk> <unk> of her fine black eyebrows .
“ Let me hope a moment !
Mademoiselle , I know this service would be more retired than that which I have <unk> .
Well !
I wish that .
I know this service would be less distinguished than that which I have <unk> .
Well !
I wish that , I know that I should win less , as to <unk> here .
Good .
I am content . ” “ I assure you , ” said I , quite embarrassed by the mere idea of having such an attendant , “ that I keep no maid — ” “ Ah , mademoiselle , but why not ?
Why not , when you can have one so devoted to you !
Who would be enchanted to serve you ; who would be so true , so zealous , and so faithful every day !
Mademoiselle , I wish with all my heart to serve you .
Do not speak of money at present .
Take me as I am .
For nothing ! ” She was so <unk> earnest that I drew back , almost afraid of her .
Without appearing to notice it , in her ardour she still pressed herself upon me , speaking in a rapid subdued voice , though always with a certain grace and <unk> .
“ Mademoiselle , I come from the <unk> country where we are quick and where we like and <unk> very strong .
My Lady was too high for me ; I was too high for her .
It is done — past — finished !
<unk> me as your domestic , and I will serve you well .
I will do more for you than you figure to yourself now .
<unk> !
Mademoiselle , I will — no matter , I will do my utmost possible in all things .
If you accept my service , you will not <unk> it .
Mademoiselle , you will not <unk> it , and I will serve you well .
You don ’ t know how well ! ” There was a lowering energy in her face as she stood looking at me while I explained the <unk> of my engaging her ( without thinking it necessary to say how very little I desired to do so ) , which seemed to bring <unk> before me some woman from the streets of Paris in the <unk> of terror .
She heard me out without <unk> and then said with her pretty <unk> and in her <unk> voice , “ Hey , mademoiselle , I have received my answer !
I am sorry of it .
But I must go elsewhere and seek what I have not found here .
Will you <unk> let me kiss your hand ? ” She looked at me more <unk> as she took it , and seemed to take note , with her <unk> touch , of every <unk> in it .
“ I fear I surprised you , mademoiselle , on the day of the storm ? ” she said with a parting curtsy .
I confessed that she had surprised us all .
“ I took an oath , mademoiselle , ” she said , smiling , “ and I wanted to stamp it on my mind so that I might keep it faithfully .
And I will !
<unk> , mademoiselle ! ” So ended our conference , which I was very glad to bring to a close .
I supposed she went away from the village , for I saw her no more ; and nothing else occurred to disturb our tranquil summer <unk> until six weeks were out and we returned home as I began just now by saying .
At that time , and for a good many weeks after that time , Richard was constant in his visits .
Besides coming every Saturday or Sunday and remaining with us until <unk> morning , he sometimes rode out on <unk> unexpectedly and passed the evening with us and rode back again early next day .
He was as vivacious as ever and told us he was very industrious , but I was not easy in my mind about him .
It appeared to me that his <unk> was all <unk> .
I could not find that it led to anything but the <unk> of <unk> hopes in connexion with the suit already the <unk> cause of so much sorrow and ruin .
He had got at the <unk> of that mystery now , he told us , and nothing could be plainer than that the will under which he and Ada were to take I don ’ t know how many thousands of pounds must be finally established if there were any sense or justice in the Court of Chancery — but oh , what a great <unk> that sounded in my ears — and that this happy conclusion could not be much longer <unk> .
He proved this to himself by all the weary <unk> on that side he had read , and every one of them sunk him deeper in the <unk> .
He had even begun to <unk> the court .
He told us how he saw Miss Flite there daily , how they talked together , and how he did her little <unk> , and how , while he laughed at her , he pitied her from his heart .
But he never thought — never , my poor , dear , sanguine Richard , capable of so much happiness then , and with such better things before him — what a fatal link was <unk> between his fresh youth and her faded age , between his free hopes and her <unk> birds , and her hungry <unk> , and her wandering mind .
Ada loved him too well to mistrust him much in anything he said or did , and my guardian , though he frequently complained of the east wind and read more than usual in the growlery , preserved a strict silence on the subject .
So I thought one day when I went to London to meet Caddy Jellyby , at her <unk> , I would ask Richard to be in waiting for me at the <unk> , that we might have a little talk together .
I found him there when I arrived , and we walked away arm in arm .
“ Well , Richard , ” said I as soon as I could begin to be grave with him , “ are you beginning to feel more settled now ? ” “ Oh , yes , my dear ! ” returned Richard .
“ I ’ m all right enough . ” “ But settled ? ” said I.
“ How do you mean , settled ? ” returned Richard with his gay laugh .
“ <unk> in the law , ” said I.
“ Oh , aye , ” replied Richard , “ I ’ m all right enough . ” “ You said that before , my dear Richard . ” “ And you don ’ t think it ’ s an answer , eh ?
Well !
Perhaps it ’ s not .
<unk> ?
You mean , do I feel as if I were <unk> down ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Why , no , I can ’ t say I am <unk> down , ” said Richard , strongly <unk> “ down , ” as if that expressed the difficulty , “ because one can ’ t settle down while this business remains in such an unsettled state .
When I say this business , of course I mean the — <unk> subject . ” “ Do you think it will ever be in a settled state ? ” said I.
“ Not the least doubt of it , ” answered Richard .
We walked a little way without speaking , and presently Richard addressed me in his <unk> and most feeling manner , thus : “ My dear Esther , I understand you , and I wish to heaven I were a more constant sort of fellow .
I don ’ t mean constant to Ada , for I love her dearly — better and better every day — but constant to myself .
( <unk> , I mean something that I can ’ t very well express , but you ’ ll make it out . )
If I were a more constant sort of fellow , I should have held on either to Badger or to Kenge and Carboy like grim death , and should have begun to be steady and <unk> by this time , and shouldn ’ t be in debt , and — ” “ ARE you in debt , Richard ? ” “ Yes , ” said Richard , “ I am a little so , my dear .
Also , I have taken rather too much to <unk> and that sort of thing .
Now the murder ’ s out ; you <unk> me , Esther , don ’ t you ? ” “ You know I don ’ t , ” said I.
“ You are <unk> to me than I often am to myself , ” he returned .
“ My dear Esther , I am a very unfortunate dog not to be more settled , but how CAN I be more settled ?
If you lived in an unfinished house , you couldn ’ t settle down in it ; if you were <unk> to leave everything you <unk> unfinished , you would find it hard to apply yourself to anything ; and yet that ’ s my unhappy case .
I was born into this unfinished <unk> with all its chances and changes , and it began to <unk> me before I quite knew the difference between a suit at law and a suit of clothes ; and it has gone on <unk> me ever since ; and here I am now , conscious sometimes that I am but a <unk> fellow to love my confiding cousin Ada . ” We were in a solitary place , and he put his hands before his eyes and sobbed as he said the words .
“ Oh , Richard ! ” said I.
“ Do not be so moved .
You have a noble nature , and Ada ’ s love may make you <unk> every day . ” “ I know , my dear , ” he replied , pressing my arm , “ I know all that .
You mustn ’ t mind my being a little soft now , for I have had all this upon my mind for a long time , and have often meant to speak to you , and have sometimes wanted opportunity and sometimes courage .
I know what the thought of Ada ought to do for me , but it <unk> ’ t do it .
I am too unsettled even for that .
I love her most <unk> , and yet I do her wrong , in doing myself wrong , every day and hour .
But it can ’ t last for ever .
We shall come on for a final hearing and get judgment in our favour , and then you and Ada shall see what I can really be ! ” It had given me a <unk> to hear him sob and see the tears start out between his fingers , but that was infinitely less affecting to me than the hopeful animation with which he said these words .
“ I have looked well into the papers , Esther .
I have been deep in them for months , ” he continued , recovering his cheerfulness in a moment , “ and you may rely upon it that we shall come out triumphant .
As to years of delay , there has been no want of them , heaven knows !
And there is the greater probability of our bringing the matter to a <unk> close ; in fact , it ’ s on the paper now .
It will be all right at last , and then you shall see ! ” <unk> how he had just now placed Messrs. Kenge and Carboy in the same <unk> with Mr. Badger , I asked him when he intended to be <unk> in Lincoln ’ s Inn .
“ There again !
I think not at all , Esther , ” he returned with an effort .
“ I fancy I have had enough of it .
Having worked at Jarndyce and Jarndyce like a <unk> <unk> , I have <unk> my <unk> for the law and satisfied myself that I shouldn ’ t like it .
Besides , I find it <unk> me more and more to be so constantly upon the scene of action .
So what , ” continued Richard , confident again by this time , “ do I naturally turn my thoughts to ? ” “ I can ’ t imagine , ” said I.
“ Don ’ t look so serious , ” returned Richard , “ because it ’ s the best thing I can do , my dear Esther , I am certain .
It ’ s not as if I wanted a profession for life .
These proceedings will come to a termination , and then I am provided for .
No .
I look upon it as a pursuit which is in its nature more or less unsettled , and therefore suited to my temporary condition — I may say , <unk> suited .
What is it that I naturally turn my thoughts to ? ” I looked at him and shook my head .
“ What , ” said Richard , in a tone of perfect conviction , “ but the army ! ” “ The army ? ” said I.
“ The army , of course .
What I have to do is to get a commission ; and — there I am , you know ! ” said Richard .
And then he showed me , proved by <unk> <unk> in his <unk> , that supposing he had contracted , say , two hundred pounds of debt in six months out of the army ; and that he contracted no debt at all within a <unk> period in the army — as to which he had quite made up his mind ; this step must involve a <unk> of four hundred pounds in a year , or two thousand pounds in five years , which was a considerable sum .
And then he spoke so <unk> and sincerely of the sacrifice he made in withdrawing himself for a time from Ada , and of the earnestness with which he aspired — as in thought he always did , I know full well — to <unk> her love , and to <unk> her happiness , and to conquer what was <unk> in himself , and to <unk> the very soul of decision , that he made my heart ache <unk> , <unk> .
For , I thought , how would this end , how could this end , when so soon and so surely all his <unk> qualities were touched by the fatal <unk> that ruined everything it rested on !
I spoke to Richard with all the earnestness I felt , and all the hope I could not quite feel then , and <unk> him for Ada ’ s sake not to put any trust in Chancery .
To all I said , Richard readily assented , riding over the court and everything else in his easy way and drawing the brightest pictures of the character he was to settle into — <unk> , when the <unk> suit should loose its hold upon him !
We had a long talk , but it always came back to that , in substance .
At last we came to <unk> Square , where Caddy Jellyby had appointed to wait for me , as a quiet place in the neighbourhood of Newman Street .
Caddy was in the garden in the centre and hurried out as soon as I appeared .
After a few cheerful words , Richard left us together .
“ Prince has a pupil over the way , Esther , ” said Caddy , “ and got the key for us .
So if you will walk round and round here with me , we can lock ourselves in and I can tell you comfortably what I wanted to see your dear good face about . ” “ Very well , my dear , ” said I.
“ Nothing could be better . ” So Caddy , after affectionately <unk> the dear good face as she called it , locked the gate , and took my arm , and we began to walk round the garden very <unk> .
“ You see , Esther , ” said Caddy , who thoroughly enjoyed a little confidence , “ after you spoke to me about its being wrong to marry without Ma ’ s knowledge , or even to keep Ma long in the dark respecting our engagement — though I don ’ t believe Ma cares much for me , I must say — I thought it right to mention your opinions to Prince .
In the first place because I want to profit by everything you tell me , and in the second place because I have no secrets from Prince . ” “ I hope he <unk> , Caddy ? ” “ Oh , my dear !
I assure you he would approve of anything you could say .
You have no idea what an opinion he has of you ! ” “ Indeed ! ” “ Esther , it ’ s enough to make anybody but me jealous , ” said Caddy , laughing and shaking her head ; “ but it only makes me joyful , for you are the first friend I ever had , and the best friend I ever can have , and nobody can respect and love you too much to please me . ” “ Upon my word , Caddy , ” said I , “ you are in the general <unk> to keep me in a good humour .
Well , my dear ? ” “ Well !
I am going to tell you , ” replied Caddy , crossing her hands confidentially upon my arm .
“ So we talked a good deal about it , and so I said to Prince , ‘ Prince , as Miss Summerson — ’ ” “ I hope you didn ’ t say ‘ Miss Summerson ’ ? ” “ No .
I didn ’ t ! ” cried Caddy , greatly pleased and with the brightest of faces .
“ I said , ‘ Esther . ’ I said to Prince , ‘ As Esther is decidedly of that opinion , Prince , and has expressed it to me , and always <unk> it when she writes those kind notes , which you are so fond of hearing me read to you , I am prepared to <unk> the truth to Ma whenever you think proper .
And I think , Prince , ’ said I , ‘ that Esther thinks that I should be in a better , and <unk> , and more honourable position altogether if you did the same to your papa . ’ ” “ Yes , my dear , ” said I.
“ Esther certainly does think so . ” “ So I was right , you see ! ” exclaimed Caddy .
“ Well !
This troubled Prince a good deal , not because he had the least doubt about it , but because he is so considerate of the feelings of old Mr. Turveydrop ; and he had his <unk> that old Mr. Turveydrop might break his heart , or faint away , or be very much overcome in some affecting manner or other if he made such an announcement .
He feared old Mr. Turveydrop might consider it <unk> and might receive too great a shock .
For old Mr. Turveydrop ’ s deportment is very beautiful , you know , Esther , ” said Caddy , “ and his feelings are extremely sensitive . ” “ Are they , my dear ? ” “ Oh , extremely sensitive .
Prince says so .
Now , this has caused my darling child — I didn ’ t mean to use the expression to you , Esther , ” Caddy <unk> , her face <unk> with <unk> , “ but I generally call Prince my darling child . ” I laughed ; and Caddy laughed and <unk> , and went on .
“ This has caused him , Esther — ” “ <unk> whom , my dear ? ” “ Oh , you tiresome thing ! ” said Caddy , laughing , with her pretty face on fire .
“ My darling child , if you <unk> upon it !
This has caused him weeks of uneasiness and has made him delay , from day to day , in a very anxious manner .
At last he said to me , ‘ Caddy , if Miss Summerson , who is a great favourite with my father , could be <unk> upon to be present when I broke the subject , I think I could do it . ’ So I promised I would ask you .
And I made up my mind , besides , ” said Caddy , looking at me hopefully but timidly , “ that if you <unk> , I would ask you afterwards to come with me to Ma .
This is what I meant when I said in my note that I had a great favour and a great assistance to beg of you .
And if you thought you could <unk> it , Esther , we should both be very grateful . ” “ Let me see , Caddy , ” said I , pretending to consider .
“ Really , I think I could do a greater thing than that if the need were pressing .
I am at your service and the darling child ’ s , my dear , whenever you like . ” Caddy was quite <unk> by this reply of mine , being , I believe , as susceptible to the least kindness or encouragement as any tender heart that ever beat in this world ; and after another turn or two round the garden , during which she put on an entirely new pair of gloves and made herself as <unk> as possible that she might do no <unk> <unk> to the Master of <unk> , we went to Newman Street direct .
Prince was teaching , of course .
We found him engaged with a not very hopeful pupil — a <unk> little girl with a sulky forehead , a deep voice , and an <unk> , <unk> mama — whose case was certainly not rendered more hopeful by the confusion into which we threw her <unk> .
The lesson at last came to an end , after proceeding as <unk> as possible ; and when the little girl had changed her shoes and had had her white <unk> <unk> in <unk> , she was taken away .
After a few words of preparation , we then went in search of Mr. Turveydrop , whom we found , <unk> with his hat and gloves , as a model of deportment , on the sofa in his private apartment — the only comfortable room in the house .
He appeared to have dressed at his leisure in the intervals of a light <unk> , and his <unk> , <unk> , and so forth , all of quite an elegant kind , lay about .
“ Father , Miss Summerson ; Miss Jellyby . ” “ <unk> !
<unk> ! ” said Mr. Turveydrop , rising with his high-shouldered bow .
“ <unk> me ! ” <unk> chairs .
“ Be seated ! ” <unk> the <unk> of his left fingers .
“ <unk> ! ” <unk> his eyes and rolling .
“ My little retreat is made a <unk> . ” <unk> himself on the sofa like the second gentleman in Europe .
“ Again you find us , Miss Summerson , ” said he , “ using our little arts to polish , polish !
Again the sex <unk> us and <unk> us by the condescension of its lovely presence .
It is much in these times ( and we have made an <unk> <unk> business of it since the days of his Royal Highness the Prince Regent — my patron , if I may presume to say so ) to experience that deportment is not wholly trodden under foot by <unk> .
That it can yet <unk> in the smile of beauty , my dear <unk> . ” I said nothing , which I thought a suitable reply ; and he took a pinch of snuff .
“ My dear son , ” said Mr. Turveydrop , “ you have four <unk> this afternoon .
I would recommend a hasty <unk> . ” “ Thank you , father , ” returned Prince , “ I will be sure to be punctual .
My dear father , may I beg you to prepare your mind for what I am going to say ? ” “ Good heaven ! ” exclaimed the model , pale and <unk> as Prince and Caddy , hand in hand , bent down before him .
“ What is this ?
Is this lunacy !
Or what is this ? ” “ Father , ” returned Prince with great <unk> , “ I love this young lady , and we are engaged . ” “ <unk> ! ” cried Mr. Turveydrop , <unk> on the sofa and shutting out the sight with his hand .
“ An <unk> <unk> at my <unk> by my own child ! ” “ We have been engaged for some time , father , ” <unk> Prince , “ and Miss Summerson , hearing of it , advised that we should declare the fact to you and was so very kind as to attend on the present occasion .
Miss Jellyby is a young lady who deeply respects you , father . ” Mr. Turveydrop uttered a groan .
“ No , pray don ’ t !
Pray don ’ t , father , ” urged his son .
“ Miss Jellyby is a young lady who deeply respects you , and our first desire is to consider your comfort . ” Mr. Turveydrop sobbed .
“ No , pray don ’ t , father ! ” cried his son .
“ <unk> , ” said Mr. Turveydrop , “ it is well that your <unk> mother is spared this <unk> .
<unk> deep , and spare not .
<unk> home , sir , strike home ! ” “ Pray don ’ t say so , father , ” <unk> Prince , in tears .
“ It goes to my heart .
I do assure you , father , that our first wish and intention is to consider your comfort .
Caroline and I do not forget our duty — what is my duty is Caroline ’ s , as we have often said together — and with your approval and consent , father , we will devote ourselves to making your life agreeable . ” “ <unk> home , ” murmured Mr. Turveydrop .
“ <unk> home ! ” But he seemed to listen , I thought , too .
“ My dear father , ” returned Prince , “ we well know what little comforts you are accustomed to and have a right to , and it will always be our study and our pride to provide those before anything .
If you will bless us with your approval and consent , father , we shall not think of being married until it is quite agreeable to you ; and when we ARE married , we shall always make you — of course — our first consideration .
You must ever be the head and master here , father ; and we feel how truly unnatural it would be in us if we failed to know it or if we failed to <unk> ourselves in every possible way to please you . ” Mr. Turveydrop <unk> a severe <unk> struggle and came upright on the sofa again with his cheeks <unk> over his stiff cravat , a perfect model of <unk> deportment .
“ My son ! ” said Mr. Turveydrop .
“ My children !
I cannot <unk> your prayer .
Be happy ! ” His <unk> as he raised his future <unk> and stretched out his hand to his son ( who kissed it with affectionate respect and gratitude ) was the most <unk> sight I ever saw .
“ My children , ” said Mr. Turveydrop , <unk> <unk> Caddy with his left arm as she sat beside him , and putting his right hand <unk> on his <unk> .
“ My son and daughter , your happiness shall be my care .
I will watch over you .
You shall always live with me ” — meaning , of course , I will always live with you — “ this house is henceforth as much yours as mine ; consider it your home .
May you long live to share it with me ! ” The power of his deportment was such that they really were as much overcome with <unk> as if , instead of <unk> himself upon them for the rest of his life , he were making some <unk> sacrifice in their favour .
“ For myself , my children , ” said Mr. Turveydrop , “ I am falling into the <unk> and yellow leaf , and it is impossible to say how long the last feeble traces of gentlemanly deportment may linger in this <unk> and <unk> age .
But , so long , I will do my duty to society and will show myself , as usual , about town .
My wants are few and simple .
My little apartment here , my few <unk> for the <unk> , my <unk> morning meal , and my little dinner will <unk> .
I charge your dutiful affection with the <unk> of these requirements , and I charge myself with all the rest . ” They were overpowered afresh by his uncommon generosity .
“ My son , ” said Mr. Turveydrop , “ for those little points in which you are deficient — points of deportment , which are born with a man , which may be improved by <unk> , but can never be originated — you may still rely on me .
I have been faithful to my post since the days of his Royal Highness the Prince Regent , and I will not desert it now .
No , my son .
If you have ever contemplated your father ’ s poor position with a feeling of pride , you may rest assured that he will do nothing to <unk> it .
For yourself , Prince , whose character is different ( we cannot be all alike , nor is it <unk> that we should ) , work , be industrious , <unk> money , and extend the connexion as much as possible . ” “ That you may depend I will do , dear father , with all my heart , ” replied Prince .
“ I have no doubt of it , ” said Mr. Turveydrop .
“ Your qualities are not shining , my dear child , but they are steady and useful .
And to both of you , my children , I would merely observe , in the spirit of a <unk> <unk> on whose path I had the happiness of casting , I believe , <unk> ray of light , take care of the establishment , take care of my simple wants , and bless you both ! ” Old Mr. Turveydrop then became so very <unk> , in honour of the occasion , that I told Caddy we must really go to Thavies Inn at once if we were to go at all that day .
So we took our departure after a very loving farewell between Caddy and her <unk> , and during our walk she was so happy and so full of old Mr. Turveydrop ’ s <unk> that I would not have said a word in his <unk> for any consideration .
The house in Thavies Inn had bills in the windows announcing that it was to let , and it looked <unk> and <unk> and <unk> than ever .
The name of poor Mr. Jellyby had appeared in the list of <unk> but a day or two before , and he was shut up in the <unk> with two gentlemen and a heap of blue bags , <unk> , and papers , making the most desperate endeavours to understand his affairs .
They appeared to me to be quite beyond his comprehension , for when Caddy took me into the <unk> by mistake and we came upon Mr. Jellyby in his spectacles , <unk> <unk> into a corner by the great <unk> and the two gentlemen , he seemed to have given up the whole thing and to be speechless and insensible .
Going upstairs to Mrs. Jellyby ’ s room ( the children were all <unk> in the kitchen , and there was no servant to be seen ) , we found that lady in the midst of a <unk> correspondence , opening , reading , and <unk> letters , with a great <unk> of torn <unk> on the floor .
She was so <unk> that at first she did not know me , though she sat looking at me with that curious , bright-eyed , <unk> look of hers .
“ Ah !
Miss Summerson ! ” she said at last .
“ I was thinking of something so different !
I hope you are well .
I am happy to see you .
Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Clare quite well ? ” I hoped in return that Mr. Jellyby was quite well .
“ Why , not quite , my dear , ” said Mrs. Jellyby in the <unk> manner .
“ He has been unfortunate in his affairs and is a little out of spirits .
<unk> for me , I am so much engaged that I have no time to think about it .
We have , at the present moment , one hundred and seventy families , Miss Summerson , <unk> five persons in each , either gone or going to the left bank of the <unk> . ” I thought of the one family so near us who were neither gone nor going to the left bank of the <unk> , and wondered how she could be so placid .
“ You have brought Caddy back , I see , ” observed Mrs. Jellyby with a glance at her daughter .
“ It has become quite a novelty to see her here .
She has almost deserted her old employment and in fact <unk> me to employ a boy . ” “ I am sure , Ma — ” began Caddy .
“ Now you know , Caddy , ” her mother mildly interposed , “ that I DO employ a boy , who is now at his dinner .
What is the use of your <unk> ? ” “ I was not going to <unk> , Ma , ” returned Caddy .
“ I was only going to say that surely you wouldn ’ t have me be a mere <unk> all my life . ” “ I believe , my dear , ” said Mrs. Jellyby , still opening her letters , casting her bright eyes <unk> over them , and <unk> them as she spoke , “ that you have a business example before you in your mother .
Besides .
A mere <unk> ?
If you had any sympathy with the <unk> of the human race , it would raise you high above any such idea .
But you have none .
I have often told you , Caddy , you have no such sympathy . ” “ Not if it ’ s Africa , Ma , I have not . ” “ Of course you have not .
Now , if I were not happily so much engaged , Miss Summerson , ” said Mrs. Jellyby , <unk> casting her eyes for a moment on me and considering where to put the particular letter she had just opened , “ this would distress and <unk> me .
But I have so much to think of , in connexion with Borrioboola-Gha and it is so necessary I should <unk> myself that there is my remedy , you see . ” As Caddy gave me a glance of entreaty , and as Mrs. Jellyby was looking far away into Africa straight through my bonnet and head , I thought it a good opportunity to come to the subject of my visit and to <unk> Mrs. Jellyby ’ s attention .
“ Perhaps , ” I began , “ you will wonder what has brought me here to <unk> you . ” “ I am always delighted to see Miss Summerson , ” said Mrs. Jellyby , pursuing her employment with a placid smile .
“ Though I wish , ” and she shook her head , “ she was more interested in the Borrioboolan project . ” “ I have come with Caddy , ” said I , “ because Caddy justly thinks she ought not to have a secret from her mother and <unk> I shall encourage and aid her ( though I am sure I don ’ t know how ) in <unk> one . ” “ Caddy , ” said Mrs. Jellyby , pausing for a moment in her occupation and then serenely pursuing it after shaking her head , “ you are going to tell me some nonsense . ” Caddy <unk> the strings of her bonnet , took her bonnet off , and letting it <unk> on the floor by the strings , and crying heartily , said , “ Ma , I am engaged . ” “ Oh , you ridiculous child ! ” observed Mrs. Jellyby with an <unk> air as she looked over the dispatch last opened ; “ what a <unk> you are ! ” “ I am engaged , Ma , ” sobbed Caddy , “ to young Mr. Turveydrop , at the academy ; and old Mr. Turveydrop ( who is a very gentlemanly man indeed ) has given his consent , and I beg and pray you ’ ll give us yours , Ma , because I never could be happy without it .
I never , never could ! ” sobbed Caddy , quite <unk> of her general <unk> and of everything but her natural affection .
“ You see again , Miss Summerson , ” observed Mrs. Jellyby serenely , “ what a happiness it is to be so much occupied as I am and to have this necessity for <unk> that I have .
Here is Caddy engaged to a <unk> ’ s son — mixed up with people who have no more sympathy with the <unk> of the human race than she has herself !
This , too , when Mr. Quale , one of the first <unk> of our time , has mentioned to me that he was really disposed to be interested in her ! ” “ Ma , I always <unk> and <unk> Mr. Quale ! ” sobbed Caddy .
“ Caddy , Caddy ! ” returned Mrs. Jellyby , opening another letter with the greatest <unk> .
“ I have no doubt you did .
How could you do otherwise , being <unk> <unk> of the <unk> with which he <unk> !
Now , if my public duties were not a favourite child to me , if I were not occupied with large <unk> on a vast scale , these <unk> details might <unk> me very much , Miss Summerson .
But can I <unk> the <unk> of a silly proceeding on the part of Caddy ( from whom I expect nothing else ) to <unk> between me and the great African <unk> ?
No .
No , ” repeated Mrs. Jellyby in a calm clear voice , and with an agreeable smile , as she opened more letters and <unk> them .
“ No , indeed . ” I was so unprepared for the perfect coolness of this reception , though I might have expected it , that I did not know what to say .
Caddy seemed equally at a loss .
Mrs. Jellyby continued to open and sort letters and to repeat occasionally in quite a charming tone of voice and with a smile of perfect composure , “ No , indeed . ” “ I hope , Ma , ” sobbed poor Caddy at last , “ you are not angry ? ” “ Oh , Caddy , you really are an absurd girl , ” returned Mrs. Jellyby , “ to ask such questions after what I have said of the <unk> of my mind . ” “ And I hope , Ma , you give us your consent and wish us well ? ” said Caddy .
“ You are a <unk> child to have done anything of this kind , ” said Mrs. Jellyby ; “ and a <unk> child , when you might have devoted yourself to the great public measure .
But the step is taken , and I have engaged a boy , and there is no more to be said .
Now , pray , Caddy , ” said Mrs. Jellyby , for Caddy was kissing her , “ don ’ t delay me in my work , but let me clear off this heavy <unk> of papers before the afternoon post comes in ! ” I thought I could not do better than take my leave ; I was detained for a moment by Caddy ’ s saying , “ You won ’ t object to my bringing him to see you , Ma ? ” “ Oh , dear me , Caddy , ” cried Mrs. Jellyby , who had <unk> into that distant contemplation , “ have you begun again ?
Bring whom ? ” “ Him , Ma . ” “ Caddy , Caddy ! ” said Mrs. Jellyby , quite weary of such little matters .
“ Then you must bring him some evening which is not a <unk> <unk> night , or a <unk> night , or a <unk> night .
You must accommodate the visit to the demands upon my time .
My dear Miss Summerson , it was very kind of you to come here to help out this silly <unk> .
Good-bye !
When I tell you that I have <unk> new letters from <unk> families anxious to understand the details of the native and <unk> question this morning , I need not <unk> for having very little leisure . ” I was not surprised by Caddy ’ s being in low spirits when we went downstairs , or by her sobbing afresh on my neck , or by her saying she would far rather have been <unk> than treated with such indifference , or by her confiding to me that she was so poor in clothes that how she was ever to be married <unk> she didn ’ t know .
I gradually <unk> her up by dwelling on the many things she would do for her unfortunate father and for Peepy when she had a home of her own ; and finally we went downstairs into the damp dark kitchen , where Peepy and his little brothers and sisters were <unk> on the stone floor and where we had such a game of play with them that to prevent myself from being quite torn to pieces I was obliged to fall back on my <unk> .
From time to time I heard loud voices in the parlour overhead , and occasionally a violent tumbling about of the furniture .
The last effect I am afraid was caused by poor Mr. Jellyby ’ s breaking away from the <unk> and making <unk> at the window with the intention of throwing himself into the area whenever he made any new attempt to understand his affairs .
As I rode quietly home at night after the day ’ s bustle , I thought a good deal of Caddy ’ s engagement and felt confirmed in my hopes ( in spite of the elder Mr. Turveydrop ) that she would be the happier and better for it .
And if there seemed to be but a <unk> chance of her and her husband ever finding out what the model of deportment really was , why that was all for the best too , and who would wish them to be wiser ?
I did not wish them to be any wiser and indeed was half ashamed of not entirely <unk> in him myself .
And I looked up at the stars , and thought about <unk> in distant <unk> and the stars THEY saw , and hoped I might always be so blest and happy as to be useful to some one in my small way .
They were so glad to see me when I got home , as they always were , that I could have sat down and cried for joy if that had not been a <unk> of making myself disagreeable .
Everybody in the house , from the <unk> to the highest , showed me such a bright face of welcome , and spoke so <unk> , and was so happy to do anything for me , that I suppose there never was such a fortunate little creature in the world .
We got into such a <unk> state that night , through Ada and my guardian drawing me out to tell them all about Caddy , that I went on prose , prose , <unk> for a length of time .
At last I got up to my own room , quite red to think how I had been holding forth , and then I heard a soft tap at my door .
So I said , “ Come in ! ” and there came in a pretty little girl , neatly dressed in mourning , who dropped a curtsy .
“ If you please , miss , ” said the little girl in a soft voice , “ I am Charley . ” “ Why , so you are , ” said I , stooping down in astonishment and giving her a kiss .
“ How glad am I to see you , Charley ! ” “ If you please , miss , ” pursued Charley in the same soft voice , “ I ’ m your maid . ” “ Charley ? ” “ If you please , miss , I ’ m a present to you , with Mr. Jarndyce ’ s love . ” I sat down with my hand on Charley ’ s neck and looked at Charley .
“ And oh , miss , ” says Charley , clapping her hands , with the tears starting down her <unk> cheeks , “ Tom ’ s at school , if you please , and <unk> so good !
And little Emma , she ’ s with Mrs. Blinder , miss , <unk> took such care of !
And Tom , he would have been at school — and Emma , she would have been left with Mrs. Blinder — and me , I should have been here — all a deal sooner , miss ; only Mr. Jarndyce thought that Tom and Emma and me had better get a little used to parting first , we was so small .
Don ’ t cry , if you please , miss ! ” “ I can ’ t help it , Charley . ” “ No , miss , nor I can ’ t help it , ” says Charley .
“ And if you please , miss , Mr. Jarndyce ’ s love , and he thinks you ’ ll like to teach me now and then .
And if you please , Tom and Emma and me is to see each other once a month .
And I ’ m so happy and so thankful , miss , ” cried Charley with a <unk> heart , “ and I ’ ll try to be such a good maid ! ” “ Oh , Charley dear , never forget who did all this ! ” “ No , miss , I never will .
Nor Tom won ’ t .
Nor yet Emma .
It was all you , miss . ” “ I have known nothing of it .
It was Mr. Jarndyce , Charley . ” “ Yes , miss , but it was all done for the love of you and that you might be my mistress .
If you please , miss , I am a little present with his love , and it was all done for the love of you .
Me and Tom was to be sure to remember it . ” Charley dried her eyes and entered on her <unk> , going in her <unk> little way about and about the room and folding up everything she could lay her hands upon .
Presently Charley came creeping back to my side and said , “ Oh , don ’ t cry , if you please , miss . ” And I said again , “ I can ’ t help it , Charley . ” And Charley said again , “ No , miss , nor I can ’ t help it . ” And so , after all , I did cry for joy indeed , and so did she .
CHAPTER <unk> An <unk> <unk> As soon as Richard and I had held the conversation of which I have given an account , Richard communicated the state of his mind to Mr. Jarndyce .
I doubt if my guardian were altogether taken by surprise when he received the <unk> , though it caused him much uneasiness and disappointment .
He and Richard were often <unk> together , late at night and early in the morning , and passed whole days in London , and had innumerable <unk> with Mr. Kenge , and laboured through a quantity of disagreeable business .
While they were thus employed , my guardian , though he <unk> considerable inconvenience from the state of the wind and rubbed his head so constantly that not a single hair upon it ever rested in its right place , was as genial with Ada and me as at any other time , but maintained a steady reserve on these matters .
And as our utmost endeavours could only <unk> from Richard himself sweeping assurances that everything was going on <unk> and that it really was all right at last , our anxiety was not much relieved by him .
We learnt , however , as the time went on , that a new application was made to the Lord Chancellor on Richard ’ s behalf as an infant and a ward , and I don ’ t know what , and that there was a quantity of talking , and that the Lord Chancellor described him in open court as a <unk> and <unk> infant , and that the matter was <unk> and <unk> , and referred , and reported on , and <unk> about until Richard began to doubt ( as he told us ) whether , if he entered the army at all , it would not be as a <unk> of seventy or <unk> years of age .
At last an appointment was made for him to see the Lord Chancellor again in his private room , and there the Lord Chancellor very seriously <unk> him for trifling with time and not knowing his mind — “ a pretty good joke , I think , ” said Richard , “ from that quarter ! ” — and at last it was settled that his application should be granted .
His name was entered at the <unk> <unk> as an <unk> for an <unk> ’ s commission ; the <unk> was deposited at an agent ’ s ; and Richard , in his usual <unk> way , <unk> into a violent course of military study and got up at five o ’ clock every morning to <unk> the broadsword exercise .
Thus , vacation succeeded term , and term succeeded vacation .
We sometimes heard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce as being in the paper or out of the paper , or as being to be mentioned , or as being to be spoken to ; and it came on , and it went off .
Richard , who was now in a professor ’ s house in London , was able to be with us less frequently than before ; my guardian still maintained the same reserve ; and so time passed until the commission was <unk> and Richard received directions with it to join a <unk> in <unk> .
He arrived <unk> with the intelligence one evening , and had a long conference with my guardian .
<unk> of an hour <unk> before my guardian put his head into the room where Ada and I were sitting and said , “ Come in , my dears ! ” We went in and found Richard , whom we had last seen in high spirits , leaning on the chimney-piece looking <unk> and angry .
“ Rick and I , Ada , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , “ are not quite of one mind .
Come , come , Rick , put a brighter face upon it ! ” “ You are very hard with me , sir , ” said Richard .
“ The harder because you have been so considerate to me in all other respects and have done me <unk> that I can never acknowledge .
I never could have been set right without you , sir . ” “ Well , well ! ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ I want to set you more right yet .
I want to set you more right with yourself . ” “ I hope you will excuse my saying , sir , ” returned Richard in a fiery way , but yet respectfully , “ that I think I am the best judge about myself . ” “ I hope you will excuse my saying , my dear Rick , ” observed Mr. Jarndyce with the <unk> cheerfulness and good humour , “ that it ’ s quite natural in you to think so , but I don ’ t think so .
I must do my duty , Rick , or you could never care for me in cool blood ; and I hope you will always care for me , cool and hot . ” Ada had turned so pale that he made her sit down in his <unk> and sat beside her .
“ It ’ s nothing , my dear , ” he said , “ it ’ s nothing .
Rick and I have only had a friendly difference , which we must state to you , for you are the theme .
Now you are afraid of what ’ s coming . ” “ I am not indeed , cousin John , ” replied Ada with a smile , “ if it is to come from you . ” “ Thank you , my dear .
Do you give me a minute ’ s calm attention , without looking at Rick .
And , little woman , do you likewise .
My dear girl , ” putting his hand on hers as it lay on the side of the easy-chair , “ you recollect the talk we had , we four when the little woman told me of a little love affair ? ” “ It is not likely that either Richard or I can ever forget your kindness that day , cousin John . ” “ I can never forget it , ” said Richard .
“ And I can never forget it , ” said Ada .
“ So much the easier what I have to say , and so much the easier for us to agree , ” returned my guardian , his face <unk> by the gentleness and honour of his heart .
“ Ada , my bird , you should know that Rick has now chosen his profession for the last time .
All that he has of certainty will be <unk> when he is fully <unk> .
He has exhausted his <unk> and is bound <unk> to the tree he has planted . ” “ Quite true that I have exhausted my present <unk> , and I am quite content to know it .
But what I have of certainty , sir , ” said Richard , “ is not all I have . ” “ Rick , Rick ! ” cried my guardian with a sudden terror in his manner , and in an altered voice , and putting up his hands as if he would have stopped his ears .
“ For the love of God , don ’ t found a hope or expectation on the family <unk> !
Whatever you do on this side the grave , never give one lingering glance towards the horrible <unk> that has <unk> us so many years .
Better to borrow , better to beg , better to die ! ” We were all startled by the <unk> of this warning .
Richard bit his lip and held his breath , and glanced at me as if he felt , and knew that I felt too , how much he needed it .
“ Ada , my dear , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , recovering his cheerfulness , “ these are strong words of advice , but I live in Bleak House and have seen a sight here .
<unk> of that .
All Richard had to start him in the race of life is ventured .
I recommend to him and you , for his sake and your own , that he should depart from us with the understanding that there is no sort of <unk> between you .
I must go further .
I will be plain with you both .
You were to confide freely in me , and I will confide freely in you .
I ask you wholly to <unk> , for the present , any tie but your relationship . ” “ Better to say at once , sir , ” returned Richard , “ that you <unk> all confidence in me and that you advise Ada to do the same . ” “ Better to say nothing of the sort , Rick , because I don ’ t mean it . ” “ You think I have begun ill , sir , ” retorted Richard .
“ I HAVE , I know . ” “ How I hoped you would begin , and how go on , I told you when we spoke of these things last , ” said Mr. Jarndyce in a cordial and encouraging manner .
“ You have not made that beginning yet , but there is a time for all things , and yours is not gone by ; rather , it is just now fully come .
Make a clear beginning altogether .
You two ( very young , my dears ) are cousins .
As yet , you are nothing more .
What more may come must come of being worked out , Rick , and no sooner . ” “ You are very hard with me , sir , ” said Richard .
“ <unk> than I could have supposed you would be . ” “ My dear boy , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , “ I am harder with myself when I do anything that gives you pain .
You have your remedy in your own hands .
Ada , it is better for him that he should be free and that there should be no youthful engagement between you .
Rick , it is better for her , much better ; you owe it to her .
Come !
<unk> of you will do what is best for the other , if not what is best for yourselves . ” “ Why is it best , sir ? ” returned Richard hastily .
“ It was not when we opened our hearts to you .
You did not say so then . ” “ I have had experience since .
I don ’ t blame you , Rick , but I have had experience since . ” “ You mean of me , sir . ” “ Well !
Yes , of both of you , ” said Mr. Jarndyce kindly .
“ The time is not come for your standing <unk> to one another .
It is not right , and I must not <unk> it .
Come , come , my young cousins , begin afresh !
<unk> shall be <unk> , and a new page turned for you to write your lives in . ” Richard gave an anxious glance at Ada but said nothing .
“ I have <unk> saying one word to either of you or to Esther , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , “ until now , in order that we might be open as the day , and all on equal terms .
I now affectionately advise , I now most earnestly entreat , you two to part as you came here .
<unk> all else to time , truth , and <unk> .
If you do otherwise , you will do wrong , and you will have made me do wrong in ever bringing you together . ” A long silence succeeded .
“ Cousin Richard , ” said Ada then , raising her blue eyes tenderly to his face , “ after what our cousin John has said , I think no choice is left us .
Your mind may be quite at ease about me , for you will leave me here under his care and will be sure that I can have nothing to wish for — quite sure if I guide myself by his advice .
I — I don ’ t doubt , cousin Richard , ” said Ada , a little confused , “ that you are very fond of me , and I — I don ’ t think you will fall in love with anybody else .
But I should like you to consider well about it too , as I should like you to be in all things very happy .
You may trust in me , cousin Richard .
I am not at all <unk> ; but I am not unreasonable , and should never blame you .
Even cousins may be sorry to part ; and in truth I am very , very sorry , Richard , though I know it ’ s for your welfare .
I shall always think of you affectionately , and often talk of you with Esther , and — and perhaps you will sometimes think a little of me , cousin Richard .
So now , ” said Ada , going up to him and giving him her trembling hand , “ we are only cousins again , Richard — for the time perhaps — and I pray for a blessing on my dear cousin , wherever he goes ! ” It was strange to me that Richard should not be able to forgive my guardian for <unk> the very same opinion of him which he himself had expressed of himself in much stronger terms to me .
But it was certainly the case .
I observed with great regret that from this hour he never was as free and open with Mr. Jarndyce as he had been before .
He had every reason given him to be so , but he was not ; and <unk> on his side , an <unk> began to arise between them .
In the business of preparation and <unk> he soon lost himself , and even his grief at parting from Ada , who remained in <unk> while he , Mr. Jarndyce , and I went up to London for a week .
He remembered her by fits and starts , even with <unk> of tears , and at such times would confide to me the <unk> <unk> .
But in a few minutes he would <unk> <unk> up some <unk> means by which they were both to be made rich and happy for ever , and would become as gay as possible .
It was a busy time , and I <unk> about with him all day long , buying a variety of things of which he stood in need .
Of the things he would have bought if he had been left to his own ways I say nothing .
He was perfectly confidential with me , and often talked so <unk> and feelingly about his faults and his <unk> <unk> , and dwelt so much upon the encouragement he derived from these <unk> that I could never have been tired if I had tried .
There used , in that week , to come backward and forward to our lodging to <unk> with Richard a person who had formerly been a <unk> soldier ; he was a fine <unk> man , of a frank free bearing , with whom Richard had <unk> for some months .
I heard so much about him , not only from Richard , but from my guardian too , that I was purposely in the room with my work one morning after breakfast when he came .
“ Good morning , Mr. George , ” said my guardian , who happened to be alone with me .
“ Mr.
Carstone will be here directly .
Meanwhile , Miss Summerson is very happy to see you , I know .
Sit down . ” He sat down , a little disconcerted by my presence , I thought , and without looking at me , drew his heavy sunburnt hand across and across his upper lip .
“ You are as punctual as the sun , ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ <unk> time , sir , ” he replied .
“ <unk> of habit .
A mere habit in me , sir .
I am not at all business-like . ” “ Yet you have a large establishment , too , I am told ? ” said Mr. Jarndyce .
“ Not much of a one , sir .
I keep a shooting gallery , but not much of a one . ” “ And what kind of a shot and what kind of a <unk> do you make of Mr. Carstone ? ” said my guardian .
“ Pretty good , sir , ” he replied , folding his arms upon his broad chest and looking very large .
“ If Mr. Carstone was to give his full mind to it , he would come out very good . ” “ But he don ’ t , I suppose ? ” said my guardian .
“ He did at first , sir , but not afterwards .
Not his full mind .
Perhaps he has something else upon it — some young lady , perhaps . ” His bright dark eyes glanced at me for the first time .
“ He has not me upon his mind , I assure you , Mr. George , ” said I , laughing , “ though you seem to suspect me . ” He <unk> a little through his brown and made me a trooper ’ s bow .
“ No offence , I hope , miss .
I am one of the <unk> . ” “ Not at all , ” said I.
“ I take it as a compliment . ” If he had not looked at me before , he looked at me now in three or four quick <unk> glances .
“ I beg your pardon , sir , ” he said to my guardian with a <unk> kind of <unk> , “ but you did me the honour to mention the young lady ’ s name — ” “ Miss Summerson . ” “ Miss Summerson , ” he repeated , and looked at me again .
“ Do you know the name ? ” I asked .
“ No , miss .
To my knowledge I never heard it .
I thought I had seen you somewhere . ” “ I think not , ” I returned , raising my head from my work to look at him ; and there was something so genuine in his speech and manner that I was glad of the opportunity .
“ I remember faces very well . ” “ So do I , miss ! ” he returned , meeting my look with the fullness of his dark eyes and broad forehead .
“ <unk> !
What set me off , now , upon that ! ” His once more reddening through his brown and being disconcerted by his efforts to remember the association brought my guardian to his relief .
“ Have you many pupils , Mr. George ? ” “ They <unk> in their number , sir .
<unk> they ’ re but a small lot to live by . ” “ And what classes of chance people come to <unk> at your gallery ? ” “ All sorts , sir .
<unk> and <unk> .
From gentlemen to ’ prentices .
I have had <unk> come , before now , and show themselves <unk> at <unk> .
<unk> people out of number , of course , but THEY go everywhere where the doors stand open . ” “ People don ’ t come with <unk> and <unk> of finishing their practice with live <unk> , I hope ? ” said my guardian , smiling .
“ Not much of that , sir , though that <unk> happened .
<unk> they come for skill — or <unk> .
Six of one , and half-a-dozen of the other .
I beg your pardon , ” said Mr. George , sitting <unk> upright and <unk> an elbow on each knee , “ but I believe you ’ re a Chancery suitor , if I have heard correct ? ” “ I am sorry to say I am . ” “ I have had one of YOUR <unk> in my time , sir . ” “ A Chancery suitor ? ” returned my guardian .
“ How was that ? ” “ Why , the man was so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> by being knocked about from post to pillar , and from pillar to post , ” said Mr. George , “ that he got out of sorts .
I don ’ t believe he had any idea of taking <unk> at anybody , but he was in that condition of <unk> and violence that he would come and pay for fifty <unk> and fire away till he was red hot .
One day I said to him when there was nobody by and he had been talking to me angrily about his wrongs , ‘ If this practice is a <unk> , comrade , well and good ; but I don ’ t altogether like your being so bent upon it in your present state of mind ; I ’ d rather you took to something else . ’ I was on my guard for a blow , he was that passionate ; but he received it in very good part and left off directly .
We shook hands and struck up a sort of friendship . ” “ What was that man ? ” asked my guardian in a new tone of interest .
“ Why , he began by being a small Shropshire <unk> before they made a <unk> bull of him , ” said Mr. George .
“ Was his name Gridley ? ” “ It was , sir . ” Mr. George directed another succession of quick bright glances at me as my guardian and I <unk> a word or two of surprise at the coincidence , and I therefore explained to him how we knew the name .
He made me another of his soldierly bows in acknowledgment of what he called my condescension .
“ I don ’ t know , ” he said as he looked at me , “ what it is that sets me off again — but — <unk> !
What ’ s my head running against ! ” He passed one of his heavy hands over his <unk> dark hair as if to sweep the broken thoughts out of his mind and sat a little forward , with one arm <unk> and the other resting on his leg , looking in a brown study at the ground .
“ I am sorry to learn that the same state of mind has got this Gridley into new <unk> and that he is in <unk> , ” said my guardian .
“ So I am told , sir , ” returned Mr. George , still musing and looking on the ground .
“ So I am told . ” “ You don ’ t know where ? ” “ No , sir , ” returned the trooper , lifting up his eyes and coming out of his <unk> .
“ I can ’ t say anything about him .
He will be worn out soon , I expect .
You may file a strong man ’ s heart away for a good many years , but it will tell all of a sudden at last . ” Richard ’ s entrance stopped the conversation .
Mr. George rose , made me another of his soldierly bows , wished my guardian a good day , and <unk> heavily out of the room .
This was the morning of the day appointed for Richard ’ s departure .
We had no more <unk> to make now ; I had completed all his <unk> early in the afternoon ; and our time was <unk> until night , when he was to go to <unk> for <unk> .
Jarndyce and Jarndyce being again expected to come on that day , Richard proposed to me that we should go down to the court and hear what passed .
As it was his last day , and he was eager to go , and I had never been there , I gave my consent and we walked down to Westminster , where the court was then sitting .
We <unk> the way with arrangements concerning the letters that Richard was to write to me and the letters that I was to write to him and with a great many hopeful <unk> .
My guardian knew where we were going and therefore was not with us .
When we came to the court , there was the Lord Chancellor — the same whom I had seen in his private room in Lincoln ’ s Inn — sitting in great state and gravity on the bench , with the <unk> and <unk> on a red table below him and an immense flat nosegay , like a little garden , which <unk> the whole court .
<unk> the table , again , was a long row of solicitors , with bundles of papers on the <unk> at their feet ; and then there were the gentlemen of the bar in wigs and gowns — some awake and some asleep , and one talking , and nobody paying much attention to what he said .
The Lord Chancellor leaned back in his very easy chair with his elbow on the <unk> arm and his forehead resting on his hand ; some of those who were present <unk> ; some read the newspapers ; some walked about or whispered in groups : all seemed perfectly at their ease , by no means in a hurry , very <unk> , and extremely comfortable .
To see everything going on so smoothly and to think of the <unk> of the suitors ’ lives and deaths ; to see all that full dress and ceremony and to think of the waste , and want , and <unk> misery it represented ; to consider that while the <unk> of hope <unk> was <unk> in so many hearts this polite show went calmly on from day to day , and year to year , in such good order and composure ; to behold the Lord Chancellor and the whole array of practitioners under him looking at one another and at the <unk> as if nobody had ever heard that all over England the name in which they were assembled was a bitter <unk> , was held in <unk> horror , contempt , and indignation , was known for something so <unk> and bad that little short of a <unk> could bring any good out of it to any one — this was so curious and <unk> to me , who had no experience of it , that it was at first <unk> , and I could not comprehend it .
I sat where Richard put me , and tried to listen , and looked about me ; but there seemed to be no reality in the whole scene except poor little Miss Flite , the <unk> , standing on a bench and nodding at it .
Miss Flite soon <unk> us and came to where we sat .
She gave me a gracious welcome to her <unk> and <unk> , with much gratification and pride , its principal attractions .
Mr. Kenge also came to speak to us and did the <unk> of the place in much the same way , with the <unk> modesty of a <unk> .
It was not a very good day for a visit , he said ; he would have <unk> the first day of term ; but it was <unk> , it was <unk> .
When we had been there half an hour or so , the case in progress — if I may use a phrase so ridiculous in such a connexion — seemed to die out of its own <unk> , without coming , or being by anybody expected to come , to any result .
The Lord Chancellor then threw down a bundle of papers from his desk to the gentlemen below him , and somebody said , “ Jarndyce and Jarndyce . ” Upon this there was a <unk> , and a laugh , and a general <unk> of the <unk> , and a bringing in of great heaps , and piles , and bags and bags full of papers .
I think it came on “ for further directions ” — about some bill of costs , to the best of my understanding , which was confused enough .
But I counted <unk> gentlemen in wigs who said they were “ in it , ” and none of them appeared to understand it much better than I.
They <unk> about it with the Lord Chancellor , and <unk> and explained among themselves , and some of them said it was this way , and some of them said it was that way , and some of them <unk> proposed to read <unk> <unk> of affidavits , and there was more <unk> and laughing , and everybody concerned was in a state of idle entertainment , and nothing could be made of it by anybody .
After an hour or so of this , and a good many <unk> being begun and cut short , it was “ referred back for the present , ” as Mr. Kenge said , and the papers were <unk> up again before the clerks had finished bringing them in .
I glanced at Richard on the termination of these hopeless proceedings and was shocked to see the worn look of his handsome young face .
“ It can ’ t last for ever , Dame Durden .
Better luck next time ! ” was all he said .
I had seen Mr. Guppy bringing in papers and <unk> them for Mr. Kenge ; and he had seen me and made me a <unk> bow , which rendered me desirous to get out of the court .
Richard had given me his arm and was taking me away when Mr. Guppy came up .
“ I beg your pardon , Mr. Carstone , ” said he in a whisper , “ and Miss Summerson ’ s also , but there ’ s a lady here , a friend of mine , who knows her and wishes to have the pleasure of shaking hands . ” As he spoke , I saw before me , as if she had started into bodily shape from my remembrance , Mrs. Rachael of my godmother ’ s house .
“ How do you do , Esther ? ” said she .
“ Do you recollect me ? ” I gave her my hand and told her yes and that she was very little altered .
“ I wonder you remember those times , Esther , ” she returned with her old <unk> .
“ They are changed now .
Well !
I am glad to see you , and glad you are not too proud to know me . ” But indeed she seemed disappointed that I was not .
“ <unk> , Mrs. Rachael ! ” I remonstrated .
“ I am married , Esther , ” she returned , <unk> correcting me , “ and am Mrs. Chadband .
Well !
I wish you good day , and I hope you ’ ll do well . ” Mr. Guppy , who had been attentive to this short <unk> , <unk> a sigh in my ear and <unk> his own and Mrs. Rachael ’ s way through the confused little crowd of people coming in and going out , which we were in the midst of and which the change in the business had brought together .
Richard and I were making our way through it , and I was yet in the first <unk> of the late unexpected recognition when I saw , coming towards us , but not seeing us , no less a person than Mr. George .
He made nothing of the people about him as he <unk> on , staring over their heads into the body of the court .
“ George ! ” said Richard as I called his attention to him .
“ You are well met , sir , ” he returned .
“ And you , miss .
Could you point a person out for me , I want ?
I don ’ t understand these places . ” <unk> as he spoke and making an easy way for us , he stopped when we were out of the press in a corner behind a great red curtain .
“ There ’ s a little cracked old woman , ” he began , “ that — ” I put up my finger , for Miss Flite was close by me , having kept beside me all the time and having called the attention of several of her legal acquaintance to me ( as I had overheard to my confusion ) by whispering in their ears , “ Hush !
Fitz Jarndyce on my left ! ” “ Hem ! ” said Mr. George .
“ You remember , miss , that we passed some conversation on a certain man this morning ?
Gridley , ” in a low whisper behind his hand .
“ Yes , ” said I.
“ He is <unk> at my place .
I couldn ’ t mention it .
Hadn ’ t his authority .
He is on his last march , miss , and has a <unk> to see her .
He says they can feel for one another , and she has been almost as good as a friend to him here .
I came down to look for her , for when I sat by Gridley this afternoon , I seemed to hear the roll of the muffled <unk> . ” “ Shall I tell her ? ” said I.
“ Would you be so good ? ” he returned with a glance of something like apprehension at Miss Flite .
“ It ’ s a <unk> I met you , miss ; I doubt if I should have known how to get on with that lady . ” And he put one hand in his breast and stood upright in a martial attitude as I informed little Miss Flite , in her ear , of the <unk> of his kind errand .
“ My angry friend from Shropshire !
<unk> as celebrated as myself ! ” she exclaimed .
“ Now really !
My dear , I will wait upon him with the greatest pleasure . ” “ He is living <unk> at Mr. George ’ s , ” said I.
“ Hush !
This is Mr. George . ” “ In — deed ! ” returned Miss Flite .
“ Very proud to have the honour !
A military man , my dear .
You know , a perfect general ! ” she whispered to me .
Poor Miss Flite <unk> it necessary to be so courtly and polite , as a mark of her respect for the army , and to curtsy so very often that it was no easy matter to get her out of the court .
When this was at last done , and addressing Mr. George as “ General , ” she gave him her arm , to the great entertainment of some <unk> who were looking on , he was so <unk> and begged me so respectfully “ not to desert him ” that I could not make up my mind to do it , especially as Miss Flite was always <unk> with me and as she too said , “ Fitz Jarndyce , my dear , you will accompany us , of course . ” As Richard seemed quite willing , and even anxious , that we should see them safely to their destination , we agreed to do so .
And as Mr. George informed us that Gridley ’ s mind had run on Mr. Jarndyce all the afternoon after hearing of their interview in the morning , I wrote a hasty note in pencil to my guardian to say where we were gone and why .
Mr. George <unk> it at a <unk> , that it might lead to no discovery , and we sent it off by a <unk> .
We then took a <unk> and drove away to the neighbourhood of Leicester Square .
We walked through some narrow courts , for which Mr. George <unk> , and soon came to the shooting gallery , the door of which was closed .
As he pulled a <unk> which hung by a chain to the <unk> , a very respectable old gentleman with grey hair , wearing spectacles , and dressed in a black <unk> and <unk> and a <unk> hat , and carrying a large <unk> <unk> , addressed him .
“ I ask your pardon , my good friend , ” said he , “ but is this George ’ s Shooting Gallery ? ” “ It is , sir , ” returned Mr. George , glancing up at the great letters in which that inscription was painted on the whitewashed wall .
“ Oh !
To be sure ! ” said the old gentleman , following his eyes .
“ Thank you .
Have you rung the bell ? ” “ My name is George , sir , and I have rung the bell . ” “ Oh , indeed ? ” said the old gentleman .
“ Your name is George ?
Then I am here as soon as you , you see .
You came for me , no doubt ? ” “ No , sir .
You have the advantage of me . ” “ Oh , indeed ? ” said the old gentleman .
“ Then it was your young man who came for me .
I am a physician and was requested — five minutes ago — to come and visit a sick man at George ’ s Shooting Gallery . ” “ The muffled <unk> , ” said Mr. George , turning to Richard and me and gravely shaking his head .
“ It ’ s quite correct , sir .
Will you please to walk in . ” The door being at that moment opened by a very <unk> little man in a <unk> cap and apron , whose face and hands and dress were blackened all over , we passed along a dreary passage into a large building with bare brick walls where there were <unk> , and guns , and <unk> , and other things of that kind .
When we had all arrived here , the physician stopped , and taking off his hat , appeared to <unk> by <unk> and to leave another and quite a different man in his place .
“ Now <unk> here , George , ” said the man , turning quickly round upon him and tapping him on the breast with a large forefinger .
“ You know me , and I know you .
You ’ re a man of the world , and I ’ m a man of the world .
My name ’ s Bucket , as you are aware , and I have got a <unk> against Gridley .
You have kept him out of the way a long time , and you have been artful in it , and it does you credit . ” Mr. George , looking hard at him , bit his lip and shook his head .
“ Now , George , ” said the other , keeping close to him , “ you ’ re a sensible man and a <unk> man ; that ’ s what YOU are , beyond a doubt .
And mind you , I don ’ t talk to you as a common character , because you have served your country and you know that when duty calls we must <unk> .
Consequently you ’ re very far from wanting to give trouble .
If I required assistance , you ’ d assist me ; that ’ s what YOU ’ D do .
Phil Squod , don ’ t you go <unk> round the gallery like that ” — the dirty little man was shuffling about with his shoulder against the wall , and his eyes on the <unk> , in a manner that looked threatening — “ because I know you and won ’ t have it . ” “ Phil ! ” said Mr. George .
“ Yes , guv ’ ner . ” “ Be quiet . ” The little man , with a low <unk> , stood still .
“ <unk> and gentlemen , ” said Mr. Bucket , “ you ’ ll excuse anything that may appear to be disagreeable in this , for my name ’ s Inspector Bucket of the Detective , and I have a duty to <unk> .
George , I know where my man is because I was on the roof last night and saw him through the skylight , and you along with him .
He is in there , you know , ” pointing ; “ that ’ s where HE is — on a <unk> .
Now I must see my man , and I must tell my man to consider himself in custody ; but you know me , and you know I don ’ t want to take any uncomfortable <unk> .
You give me your word , as from one man to another ( and an old soldier , mind you , likewise ) , that it ’ s honourable between us two , and I ’ ll accommodate you to the utmost of my power . ” “ I give it , ” was the reply .
“ But it wasn ’ t handsome in you , Mr. Bucket . ” “ <unk> , George !
Not handsome ? ” said Mr. Bucket , tapping him on his broad breast again and shaking hands with him .
“ I don ’ t say it wasn ’ t handsome in you to keep my man so close , do I ?
Be equally <unk> to me , old boy !
Old William Tell , Old <unk> , the <unk> <unk> !
Why , he ’ s a model of the whole British army in himself , ladies and gentlemen .
I ’ d give a <unk> ’ note to be such a figure of a man ! ” The affair being brought to this head , Mr. George , after a little consideration , proposed to go in first to his comrade ( as he called him ) , taking Miss Flite with him .
Mr. Bucket <unk> , they went away to the further end of the gallery , leaving us sitting and standing by a table covered with guns .
Mr. Bucket took this opportunity of entering into a little light conversation , asking me if I were afraid of <unk> , as most young ladies were ; asking Richard if he were a good shot ; asking Phil Squod which he considered the best of those <unk> and what it might be worth <unk> , telling him in return that it was a pity he ever gave way to his temper , for he was naturally so amiable that he might have been a young woman , and making himself generally agreeable .
After a time he followed us to the further end of the gallery , and Richard and I were going quietly away when Mr. George came after us .
He said that if we had no objection to see his comrade , he would take a visit from us very kindly .
The words had hardly passed his lips when the bell was rung and my guardian appeared , “ on the chance , ” he slightly observed , “ of being able to do any little thing for a poor fellow involved in the same misfortune as himself . ” We all four went back together and went into the place where Gridley was .
It was a bare room , <unk> off from the gallery with <unk> wood .
As the <unk> was not more than eight or ten feet high and only enclosed the sides , not the top , the <unk> of the high gallery roof were overhead , and the skylight through which Mr. Bucket had looked down .
The sun was low — near setting — and its light came <unk> in above , without <unk> to the ground .
Upon a plain <unk> sofa lay the man from Shropshire , dressed much as we had seen him last , but so changed that at first I recognized no likeness in his <unk> face to what I <unk> .
He had been still writing in his <unk> , and still dwelling on his <unk> , hour after hour .
A table and some <unk> were covered with manuscript papers and with worn pens and a <unk> of such tokens .
<unk> and <unk> drawn together , he and the little mad woman were side by side and , as it were , alone .
She sat on a chair holding his hand , and none of us went close to them .
His voice had faded , with the old expression of his face , with his strength , with his anger , with his <unk> to the wrongs that had at last subdued him .
The <unk> shadow of an object full of form and colour is such a picture of it as he was of the man from Shropshire whom we had spoken with before .
He inclined his head to Richard and me and spoke to my guardian .
“ Mr.
Jarndyce , it is very kind of you to come to see me .
I am not long to be seen , I think .
I am very glad to take your hand , sir .
You are a good man , superior to injustice , and God knows I honour you . ” They shook hands earnestly , and my guardian said some words of comfort to him .
“ It may seem strange to you , sir , ” returned Gridley ; “ I should not have liked to see you if this had been the first time of our meeting .
But you know I made a <unk> for it , you know I stood up with my single hand against them all , you know I told them the truth to the last , and told them what they were , and what they had done to me ; so I don ’ t mind your seeing me , this <unk> . ” “ You have been <unk> with them many and many a time , ” returned my guardian .
“ Sir , I have been , ” with a faint smile .
“ I told you what would come of it when I ceased to be so , and see here !
Look at us — look at us ! ” He drew the hand Miss Flite held through her arm and brought her something nearer to him .
“ This ends it .
Of all my old <unk> , of all my old pursuits and hopes , of all the living and the dead world , this one poor soul alone comes natural to me , and I am fit for .
There is a tie of many suffering years between us two , and it is the only tie I ever had on earth that Chancery has not broken . ” “ <unk> my blessing , Gridley , ” said Miss Flite in tears .
“ <unk> my blessing ! ” “ I thought , <unk> , that they never could break my heart , Mr. Jarndyce .
I was resolved that they should not .
I did believe that I could , and would , charge them with being the <unk> they were until I died of some bodily disorder .
But I am worn out .
How long I have been wearing out , I don ’ t know ; I seemed to break down in an hour .
I hope they may never come to hear of it .
I hope everybody here will lead them to believe that I died <unk> them , <unk> and <unk> , as I did through so many years . ” Here Mr. Bucket , who was sitting in a corner by the door , <unk> offered such consolation as he could <unk> .
“ Come , come ! ” he said from his corner .
“ Don ’ t go on in that way , Mr. Gridley .
You are only a little low .
We are all of us a little low sometimes .
I am .
Hold up , hold up !
You ’ ll lose your temper with the whole round of ’ em , again and again ; and I shall take you on a score of <unk> yet , if I have luck . ” He only shook his head .
“ Don ’ t shake your head , ” said Mr. Bucket .
“ <unk> it ; that ’ s what I want to see you do .
Why , Lord bless your soul , what times we have had together !
<unk> ’ t I seen you in the <unk> over and over again for contempt ?
<unk> ’ t I come into court , twenty <unk> for no other purpose than to see you <unk> the Chancellor like a <unk> ?
Don ’ t you remember when you first began to <unk> the lawyers , and the peace was <unk> against you two or three times a week ?
Ask the little old lady there ; she has been always present .
Hold up , Mr. Gridley , hold up , sir ! ” “ What are you going to do about him ? ” asked George in a low voice .
“ I don ’ t know yet , ” said Bucket in the same tone .
Then resuming his encouragement , he pursued aloud : “ <unk> out , Mr. Gridley ?
After <unk> me for all these weeks and <unk> me to <unk> the roof here like a <unk> cat and to come to see you as a doctor ?
That ain ’ t like being worn out .
I should think not !
Now I tell you what you want .
You want excitement , you know , to keep YOU up ; that ’ s what YOU want .
You ’ re used to it , and you can ’ t do without it .
I couldn ’ t myself .
Very well , then ; here ’ s this <unk> got by Mr. Tulkinghorn of Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields , and backed into half-a-dozen <unk> since .
What do you say to coming along with me , upon this <unk> , and having a good angry argument before the <unk> ?
It ’ ll do you good ; it ’ ll <unk> you up and get you into <unk> for another turn at the Chancellor .
Give in ?
Why , I am surprised to hear a man of your energy talk of giving in .
You mustn ’ t do that .
You ’ re half the <unk> of the fair in the Court of Chancery .
George , you lend Mr. Gridley a hand , and let ’ s see now whether he won ’ t be better up than down . ” “ He is very weak , ” said the trooper in a low voice .
“ Is he ? ” returned Bucket anxiously .
“ I only want to <unk> him .
I don ’ t like to see an old acquaintance giving in like this .
It would cheer him up more than anything if I could make him a little <unk> with me .
He ’ s welcome to drop into me , right and left , if he likes .
I shall never take advantage of it . ” The roof rang with a scream from Miss Flite , which still rings in my ears .
“ Oh , no , Gridley ! ” she cried as he fell heavily and calmly back from before her .
“ Not without my blessing .
After so many years ! ” The sun was down , the light had gradually <unk> from the roof , and the shadow had crept upward .
But to me the shadow of that pair , one living and one dead , fell <unk> on Richard ’ s departure than the darkness of the <unk> night .
And through Richard ’ s farewell words I heard it echoed : “ Of all my old <unk> , of all my old pursuits and hopes , of all the living and the dead world , this one poor soul alone comes natural to me , and I am fit for .
There is a tie of many suffering years between us two , and it is the only tie I ever had on earth that Chancery has not broken ! ” CHAPTER <unk> Mrs. Snagsby <unk> It All There is <unk> in Cook ’ s Court , Cursitor Street .
<unk> suspicion <unk> in that peaceful region .
The <unk> of Cook ’ s <unk> are in their usual state of mind , no better and no worse ; but Mr. Snagsby is changed , and his little woman knows it .
For Tom-all-Alone ’ s and Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields <unk> in <unk> themselves , a pair of <unk> <unk> , to the <unk> of Mr. Snagsby ’ s imagination ; and Mr. Bucket drives ; and the passengers are Jo and Mr. Tulkinghorn ; and the complete <unk> <unk> though the <unk> business at wild speed all round the clock .
Even in the little front kitchen where the family <unk> are taken , it rattles away at a smoking pace from the <unk> , when Mr. Snagsby pauses in <unk> the first <unk> of the leg of mutton <unk> with potatoes and stares at the kitchen wall .
Mr. Snagsby cannot make out what it is that he has had to do with .
Something is wrong somewhere , but what something , what may come of it , to whom , when , and from which <unk> of and <unk> of quarter is the <unk> of his life .
His remote impressions of the <unk> and <unk> , the stars and <unk> , that <unk> through the <unk> of Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s chambers ; his <unk> for the mysteries <unk> over by that best and <unk> of his <unk> , whom all the <unk> of Court , all Chancery Lane , and all the legal neighbourhood agree to hold in awe ; his remembrance of Detective Mr. Bucket with his forefinger and his confidential manner , impossible to be <unk> or <unk> , persuade him that he is a party to some dangerous secret without knowing what it is .
And it is the fearful <unk> of this condition that , at any hour of his daily life , at any opening of the shop-door , at any pull of the bell , at any entrance of a messenger , or any <unk> of a letter , the secret may take air and fire , <unk> , and blow up — Mr.
Bucket only knows whom .
For which reason , whenever a man unknown comes into the shop ( as many men unknown do ) and says , “ Is Mr. Snagsby in ? ” or words to that innocent effect , Mr. Snagsby ’ s heart knocks hard at his guilty breast .
He <unk> so much from such inquiries that when they are made by boys he <unk> himself by <unk> at their ears over the counter and asking the young dogs what they mean by it and why they can ’ t speak out at once ?
More <unk> men and boys <unk> in walking into Mr. Snagsby ’ s sleep and <unk> him with unaccountable questions , so that often when the cock at the little <unk> in Cursitor Street breaks out in his usual absurd way about the morning , Mr. Snagsby finds himself in a <unk> of <unk> , with his little woman shaking him and saying “ What ’ s the matter with the man ! ” The little woman herself is not the least <unk> in his difficulty .
To know that he is always keeping a secret from her , that he has under all circumstances to conceal and hold fast a tender double <unk> , which her <unk> is ever ready to twist out of his head , gives Mr. Snagsby , in her <unk> presence , much of the air of a dog who has a reservation from his master and will look anywhere rather than meet his eye .
These various signs and tokens , marked by the little woman , are not lost upon her .
They <unk> her to say , “ Snagsby has something on his mind ! ” And thus suspicion gets into Cook ’ s Court , Cursitor Street .
From suspicion to jealousy , Mrs. Snagsby finds the road as natural and short as from Cook ’ s Court to Chancery Lane .
And thus jealousy gets into Cook ’ s Court , Cursitor Street .
Once there ( and it was always <unk> <unk> ) , it is very active and <unk> in Mrs. Snagsby ’ s breast , <unk> her to <unk> <unk> of Mr. Snagsby ’ s pockets ; to secret <unk> of Mr. Snagsby ’ s letters ; to private <unk> in the day book and <unk> , till , <unk> , and iron safe ; to <unk> at windows , <unk> behind doors , and a general putting of this and that together by the wrong end .
Mrs. Snagsby is so <unk> on the <unk> that the house becomes ghostly with <unk> <unk> and rustling <unk> .
The ’ prentices think somebody may have been murdered there in <unk> times .
Guster holds certain loose <unk> of an idea ( picked up at <unk> , where they were found <unk> among the <unk> ) that there is buried money underneath the cellar , <unk> by an old man with a white <unk> , who cannot get out for seven thousand years because he said the Lord ’ s <unk> <unk> .
“ Who was Nimrod ? ” Mrs. Snagsby repeatedly inquires of herself .
“ Who was that lady — that creature ?
And who is that boy ? ” Now , Nimrod being as dead as the mighty <unk> whose name Mrs. Snagsby has <unk> , and the lady being <unk> , she directs her mental eye , for the present , with <unk> <unk> to the boy .
“ And who , ” quoth Mrs. Snagsby for the thousand and first time , “ is that boy ?
Who is that — ! ” And there Mrs. Snagsby is seized with an <unk> .
He has no respect for Mr. Chadband .
No , to be sure , and he wouldn ’ t have , of course .
<unk> he wouldn ’ t , under those <unk> circumstances .
He was invited and appointed by Mr. Chadband — why , Mrs. Snagsby heard it herself with her own ears ! — to come back , and be told where he was to go , to be addressed by Mr. Chadband ; and he never came !
Why did he never come ?
Because he was told not to come .
Who told him not to come ?
Who ?
Ha , ha !
Mrs. Snagsby sees it all .
But happily ( and Mrs. Snagsby tightly shakes her head and tightly smiles ) that boy was met by Mr. Chadband yesterday in the streets ; and that boy , as <unk> a subject which Mr. Chadband <unk> to improve for the spiritual delight of a <unk> congregation , was seized by Mr. Chadband and <unk> with being delivered over to the police unless he showed the reverend gentleman where he lived and unless he entered into , and <unk> , an undertaking to appear in Cook ’ s Court to-morrow night , “ to — <unk> — row — night , ” Mrs. Snagsby repeats for mere emphasis with another tight smile and another tight shake of her head ; and to-morrow night that boy will be here , and to-morrow night Mrs. Snagsby will have her eye upon him and upon some one else ; and oh , you may walk a long while in your secret ways ( says Mrs. Snagsby with <unk> and scorn ) , but you can ’ t blind ME !
Mrs. Snagsby sounds no <unk> in anybody ’ s ears , but holds her purpose quietly , and keeps her counsel .
<unk> comes , the <unk> preparations for the <unk> <unk> come , the evening comes .
<unk> Mr. Snagsby in his black coat ; come the Chadbands ; come ( when the <unk> vessel is <unk> ) the ’ prentices and Guster , to be <unk> ; comes at last , with his <unk> head , and his shuffle backward , and his shuffle forward , and his shuffle to the right , and his shuffle to the left , and his bit of fur cap in his muddy hand , which he <unk> as if it were some <unk> bird he had caught and was <unk> before eating raw , Jo , the very , very <unk> subject Mr. Chadband is to improve .
Mrs. Snagsby <unk> a watchful glance on Jo as he is brought into the little drawing-room by Guster .
He looks at Mr. Snagsby the moment he comes in .
<unk> !
Why does he look at Mr. Snagsby ?
Mr. Snagsby looks at him .
Why should he do that , but that Mrs. Snagsby sees it all ?
Why else should that look pass between them , why else should Mr. Snagsby be confused and cough a signal cough behind his hand ?
It is as clear as <unk> that Mr. Snagsby is that boy ’ s father .
“ <unk> , my friends , ” says Chadband , rising and wiping the <unk> <unk> from his reverend <unk> .
“ <unk> be with us !
My friends , why with us ?
Because , ” with his fat smile , “ it cannot be against us , because it must be for us ; because it is not <unk> , because it is <unk> ; because it does not make <unk> like the <unk> , but comes home unto us like the <unk> .
Therefore , my friends , peace be with us !
My human boy , come forward ! ” <unk> forth his <unk> <unk> , Mr. Chadband lays the same on Jo ’ s arm and considers where to station him .
Jo , very doubtful of his reverend friend ’ s intentions and not at all clear but that something practical and painful is going to be done to him , mutters , “ You let me alone .
I never said nothink to you .
You let me alone . ” “ No , my young friend , ” says Chadband smoothly , “ I will not let you alone .
And why ?
Because I am a <unk> , because I am a <unk> and a <unk> , because you are delivered over unto me and are become as a precious instrument in my hands .
My friends , may I so employ this instrument as to use it to your advantage , to your profit , to your gain , to your welfare , to your <unk> !
My young friend , sit upon this stool . ” Jo , apparently possessed by an impression that the reverend gentleman wants to cut his hair , <unk> his head with both arms and is got into the required position with great difficulty and every possible <unk> of <unk> .
When he is at last <unk> like a <unk> , Mr. Chadband , retiring behind the table , holds up his bear ’ <unk> and says , “ My friends ! ” This is the signal for a general settlement of the audience .
The ’ prentices <unk> <unk> and <unk> each other .
Guster falls into a staring and vacant state , <unk> of a <unk> admiration of Mr. Chadband and pity for the <unk> <unk> whose condition touches her nearly .
Mrs. Snagsby silently lays <unk> of gunpowder .
Mrs. Chadband <unk> herself grimly by the fire and <unk> her knees , finding that sensation favourable to the reception of eloquence .
It happens that Mr. Chadband has a <unk> habit of fixing some member of his congregation with his eye and <unk> arguing his points with that particular person , who is understood to be expected to be moved to an occasional <unk> , groan , gasp , or other audible expression of inward working , which expression of inward working , being echoed by some <unk> lady in the next pew and so communicated like a game of <unk> through a circle of the more <unk> <unk> present , <unk> the purpose of <unk> <unk> and gets Mr. Chadband ’ s <unk> up .
From mere force of habit , Mr. Chadband in saying “ My friends ! ” has rested his eye on Mr. Snagsby and proceeds to make that <unk> stationer , already sufficiently confused , the immediate <unk> of his discourse .
“ We have here among us , my friends , ” says Chadband , “ a <unk> and a heathen , a <unk> in the <unk> of Tom-all-Alone ’ s and a <unk> upon the surface of the earth .
We have here among us , my friends , ” and Mr. Chadband , <unk> the point with his dirty thumb-nail , <unk> an <unk> smile on Mr. Snagsby , <unk> that he will throw him an <unk> <unk> presently if he be not already down , “ a brother and a boy .
<unk> of parents , devoid of relations , devoid of <unk> and <unk> , devoid of gold and silver and of precious stones .
Now , my friends , why do I say he is devoid of these <unk> ?
Why ?
Why is he ? ” Mr. Chadband states the question as if he were <unk> an entirely new <unk> of much <unk> and merit to Mr. Snagsby and <unk> him not to give it up .
Mr. Snagsby , greatly perplexed by the mysterious look he received just now from his little woman — at about the period when Mr. Chadband mentioned the word parents — is tempted into modestly <unk> , “ I don ’ t know , I ’ m sure , sir . ” On which <unk> Mrs. Chadband <unk> and Mrs. Snagsby says , “ For shame ! ” “ I hear a voice , ” says Chadband ; “ is it a still small voice , my friends ?
I fear not , though I <unk> would hope so — ” “ Ah — <unk> ! ” from Mrs. Snagsby .
“ Which says , ‘ I don ’ t know . ’ Then I will tell you why .
I say this brother present here among us is devoid of parents , devoid of relations , devoid of <unk> and <unk> , devoid of gold , of silver , and of precious stones because he is devoid of the light that shines in upon some of us .
What is that light ?
What is it ?
I ask you , what is that light ? ” Mr. Chadband draws back his head and pauses , but Mr. Snagsby is not to be <unk> on to his <unk> again .
Mr. Chadband , leaning forward over the table , <unk> what he has got to follow directly into Mr. Snagsby with the thumb-nail already mentioned .
“ It is , ” says Chadband , “ the ray of <unk> , the sun of <unk> , the moon of <unk> , the star of stars .
It is the light of Terewth . ” Mr. Chadband draws himself up again and looks triumphantly at Mr. Snagsby as if he would be glad to know how he feels after that .
“ Of Terewth , ” says Mr. Chadband , <unk> him again .
“ Say not to me that it is NOT the lamp of lamps .
I say to you it is .
I say to you , a million of times over , it is .
It is !
I say to you that I will <unk> it to you , whether you like it or not ; <unk> , that the less you like it , the more I will <unk> it to you .
With a <unk> !
I say to you that if you <unk> yourself against it , you shall fall , you shall be <unk> , you shall be <unk> , you shall be <unk> , you shall be <unk> . ” The present effect of this flight of <unk> — much admired for its general power by Mr. Chadband ’ s followers — being not only to make Mr. Chadband <unk> warm , but to represent the innocent Mr. Snagsby in the light of a determined enemy to virtue , with a forehead of <unk> and a heart of <unk> , that unfortunate <unk> becomes yet more disconcerted and is in a very advanced state of low spirits and false position when Mr. Chadband accidentally <unk> him .
“ My friends , ” he resumes after <unk> his fat head for some time — and it smokes to such an extent that he seems to light his <unk> at it , which smokes , too , after every <unk> — “ to pursue the subject we are endeavouring with our <unk> <unk> to improve , let us in a spirit of love inquire what is that Terewth to which I have <unk> .
For , my young friends , ” suddenly addressing the ’ prentices and Guster , to their <unk> , “ if I am told by the doctor that <unk> or <unk> is good for me , I may naturally ask what is <unk> , and what is <unk> .
I may wish to be informed of that before I <unk> myself with either or with both .
Now , my young friends , what is this Terewth then ?
<unk> ( in a spirit of love ) , what is the common sort of Terewth — the working clothes — the <unk> wear , my young friends ?
Is it <unk> ? ” “ Ah — <unk> ! ” from Mrs. Snagsby .
“ Is it <unk> ? ” A <unk> in the <unk> from Mrs. Snagsby .
“ Is it reservation ? ” A shake of the head from Mrs. Snagsby — very long and very tight .
“ No , my friends , it is neither of these .
Neither of these names <unk> to it .
When this young heathen now among us — who is now , my friends , asleep , the seal of indifference and <unk> being set upon his <unk> ; but do not wake him , for it is right that I should have to <unk> , and to <unk> and to struggle , and to conquer , for his sake — when this young <unk> heathen told us a story of a cock , and of a bull , and of a lady , and of a sovereign , was THAT the Terewth ?
No .
Or if it was partly , was it wholly and entirely ?
No , my friends , no ! ” If Mr. Snagsby could <unk> his little woman ’ s look as it enters at his eyes , the windows of his soul , and <unk> the whole <unk> , he were other than the man he is .
He <unk> and <unk> .
“ Or , my juvenile friends , ” says Chadband , <unk> to the level of their comprehension with a very <unk> <unk> in his <unk> meek smile of coming a long way downstairs for the purpose , “ if the master of this house was to go forth into the city and there see an <unk> , and was to come back , and was to call unto him the mistress of this house , and was to say , ‘ <unk> , rejoice with me , for I have seen an <unk> ! ’ would THAT be Terewth ? ” Mrs. Snagsby in tears .
“ Or put it , my juvenile friends , that he saw an <unk> , and returning said ‘ <unk> , the city is <unk> , I have seen but an <unk> , ’ would THAT be Terewth ? ” Mrs. Snagsby sobbing <unk> .
“ Or put it , my juvenile friends , ” said Chadband , <unk> by the sound , “ that the unnatural parents of this <unk> heathen — for parents he had , my juvenile friends , beyond a doubt — after casting him forth to the <unk> and the <unk> , and the wild dogs and the young <unk> , and the <unk> , went back to their <unk> and had their pipes , and their pots , and their <unk> and their <unk> , and their <unk> <unk> , and their butcher ’ s <unk> and poultry , would THAT be Terewth ? ” Mrs. Snagsby replies by delivering herself a prey to <unk> , not an <unk> prey , but a crying and a tearing one , so that Cook ’ s Court <unk> with her <unk> .
<unk> , becoming <unk> , she has to be carried up the narrow staircase like a grand piano .
After unspeakable suffering , <unk> of the utmost <unk> , she is <unk> , by expresses from the bedroom , free from pain , though much exhausted , in which state of affairs Mr. Snagsby , <unk> and crushed in the <unk> removal , and extremely timid and feeble , ventures to come out from behind the door in the drawing-room .
All this time Jo has been standing on the spot where he <unk> up , ever <unk> his cap and putting bits of fur in his mouth .
He spits them out with a <unk> air , for he feels that it is in his nature to be an <unk> <unk> and that it ’ s no good HIS trying to keep awake , for HE won ’ t never know nothink .
Though it may be , Jo , that there is a history so interesting and affecting even to minds as near the <unk> as <unk> , <unk> <unk> done on this earth for common men , that if the Chadbands , removing their own persons from the light , would but show it thee in simple <unk> , would but leave it <unk> , would but regard it as being eloquent enough without their modest aid — it might hold thee awake , and <unk> might learn from it yet !
Jo never heard of any such book .
Its <unk> and the <unk> Chadband are all one to him , except that he knows the <unk> Chadband and would rather run away from him for an hour than hear him talk for five minutes .
“ It an ’ t no good my waiting here no longer , ” thinks Jo .
“ Mr.
Snagsby an ’ t a-going to say nothink to me to-night . ” And downstairs he <unk> .
But downstairs is the charitable Guster , holding by the <unk> of the kitchen stairs and <unk> off a fit , as yet <unk> , the same having been induced by Mrs. Snagsby ’ s <unk> .
She has her own supper of bread and <unk> to hand to Jo , with whom she ventures to <unk> a word or so for the first time .
“ Here ’ s something to eat , poor boy , ” says Guster .
“ Thank ’ <unk> , <unk> , ” says Jo .
“ Are you hungry ? ” “ <unk> ! ” says Jo .
“ What ’ s gone of your father and your mother , eh ? ” Jo stops in the middle of a bite and looks <unk> .
For this orphan charge of the Christian saint whose <unk> was at <unk> has patted him on the shoulder , and it is the first time in his life that any decent hand has been so laid upon him .
“ I never know ’ d nothink about ’ em , ” says Jo .
“ No more didn ’ t I of mine , ” cries Guster .
She is <unk> <unk> favourable to the fit when she seems to take alarm at something and <unk> down the stairs .
“ Jo , ” whispers the law-stationer softly as the boy <unk> on the step .
“ Here I am , Mr. Snagsby ! ” “ I didn ’ t know you were gone — there ’ s another half-crown , Jo .
It was quite right of you to say nothing about the lady the other night when we were out together .
It would breed trouble .
You can ’ t be too quiet , Jo . ” “ I am fly , master ! ” And so , good night .
A ghostly shade , <unk> and <unk> , follows the law-stationer to the room he came from and glides higher up .
And henceforth he begins , go where he will , to be attended by another shadow than his own , hardly less constant than his own , hardly less quiet than his own .
And into whatsoever atmosphere of secrecy his own shadow may pass , let all concerned in the secrecy <unk> !
For the watchful Mrs. Snagsby is there too — bone of his bone , flesh of his flesh , shadow of his shadow .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> <unk> morning , looking with dull eyes and sallow face upon the neighbourhood of Leicester Square , finds its inhabitants unwilling to get out of bed .
Many of them are not early <unk> at the brightest of times , being birds of night who <unk> when the sun is high and are wide awake and keen for prey when the stars shine out .
<unk> dingy blind and curtain , in upper story and <unk> , <unk> more or less under false names , false hair , false titles , false <unk> , and false <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> lie in their first sleep .
Gentlemen of the <unk> road who could discourse from personal experience of foreign <unk> and home <unk> ; <unk> of strong <unk> that <unk> <unk> with weakness and miserable fear , broken <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and false witnesses ; some not <unk> by the <unk> beneath their dirty <unk> ; all with more <unk> in them than was in <unk> , and more crime than is in <unk> .
For <unk> bad the devil can be in <unk> or <unk> ( and he can be very bad in both ) , he is a more <unk> , <unk> , and intolerable devil when he sticks a <unk> in his <unk> , calls himself a gentleman , backs a card or colour , plays a game or so of <unk> , and knows a little about bills and <unk> notes , than in any other form he wears .
And in such form Mr. Bucket shall find him , when he will , still <unk> the <unk> <unk> of Leicester Square .
But the wintry morning wants him not and <unk> him not .
It <unk> Mr. George of the shooting gallery and his familiar .
They arise , roll up and <unk> away their <unk> .
Mr. George , having <unk> himself before a <unk> of minute proportions , then marches out , <unk> and <unk> , to the <unk> in the little yard and <unk> comes back shining with yellow soap , <unk> , <unk> rain , and exceedingly cold water .
As he rubs himself upon a large <unk> , blowing like a military sort of <unk> just come up , his hair <unk> tighter and tighter on his sunburnt temples the more he rubs it so that it looks as if it never could be <unk> by any less <unk> instrument than an iron <unk> or a <unk> — as he rubs , and <unk> , and <unk> , and blows , turning his head from side to side the more <unk> to <unk> his throat , and standing with his body well bent forward to keep the wet from his martial legs , Phil , on his knees lighting a fire , looks round as if it were enough washing for him to see all that done , and sufficient <unk> for one day to take in the superfluous health his master throws off .
When Mr. George is dry , he goes to work to brush his head with two hard <unk> at once , to that <unk> degree that Phil , <unk> his way round the gallery in the act of sweeping it , winks with sympathy .
This <unk> over , the <unk> part of Mr. George ’ s <unk> is soon performed .
He fills his pipe , lights it , and marches up and down smoking , as his custom is , while Phil , raising a powerful <unk> of hot rolls and coffee , prepares breakfast .
He smokes gravely and marches in slow time .
Perhaps this morning ’ s pipe is devoted to the memory of Gridley in his grave .
“ And so , Phil , ” says George of the shooting gallery after several turns in silence , “ you were <unk> of the country last night ? ” Phil , by the by , said as much in a tone of surprise as he <unk> out of bed .
“ Yes , guv ’ ner . ” “ What was it like ? ” “ I hardly know what it was like , guv ’ ner , ” said Phil , considering .
“ How did you know it was the country ? ” “ On account of the grass , I think .
And the <unk> upon it , ” says Phil after further consideration .
“ What were the <unk> doing on the grass ? ” “ They was <unk> of it , I expect , ” says Phil .
The master resumes his march , and the man resumes his preparation of breakfast .
It is not <unk> a <unk> preparation , being limited to the setting forth of very simple breakfast <unk> for two and the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> at the fire in the rusty grate ; but as Phil has to <unk> round a considerable part of the gallery for every object he wants , and never brings two objects at once , it takes time under the circumstances .
At length the breakfast is ready .
Phil announcing it , Mr. George knocks the ashes out of his pipe on the <unk> , stands his pipe itself in the chimney corner , and sits down to the meal .
When he has helped himself , Phil follows suit , sitting at the extreme end of the little <unk> table and taking his plate on his knees .
<unk> in humility , or to hide his blackened hands , or because it is his natural manner of eating .
“ The country , ” says Mr. George , <unk> his knife and fork ; “ why , I suppose you never <unk> your eyes on the country , Phil ? ” “ I see the marshes once , ” says Phil , <unk> eating his breakfast .
“ What marshes ? ” “ THE marshes , commander , ” returns Phil .
“ Where are they ? ” “ I don ’ t know where they are , ” says Phil ; “ but I see ’ em , guv ’ ner .
They was flat .
And <unk> . ” <unk> and commander are <unk> terms with Phil , expressive of the same respect and deference and applicable to nobody but Mr. George .
“ I was born in the country , Phil . ” “ Was you indeed , commander ? ” “ Yes .
And bred there . ” Phil <unk> his one eyebrow , and after respectfully staring at his master to express interest , <unk> a great <unk> of coffee , still staring at him .
“ There ’ s not a bird ’ s note that I don ’ t know , ” says Mr. George .
“ Not many an English leaf or <unk> that I couldn ’ t name .
Not many a tree that I couldn ’ t <unk> yet if I was put to it .
I was a real country boy , once .
My good mother lived in the country . ” “ She must have been a fine old lady , guv ’ ner , ” Phil observes .
“ Aye !
And not so old either , five and thirty years ago , ” says Mr. George .
“ But I ’ ll wager that at <unk> she would be near as upright as me , and near as broad across the shoulders . ” “ Did she die at <unk> , guv ’ ner ? ” inquires Phil .
“ No .
<unk> !
Let her rest in peace , God bless her ! ” says the trooper .
“ What set me on about country boys , and <unk> , and <unk> ?
You , to be sure !
So you never <unk> your eyes upon the country — marshes and <unk> <unk> .
Eh ? ” Phil shakes his head .
“ Do you want to see it ? ” “ <unk> , I don ’ t know as I do , particular , ” says Phil .
“ The town ’ s enough for you , eh ? ” “ Why , you see , commander , ” says Phil , “ I ain ’ t acquainted with <unk> else , and I doubt if I ain ’ t <unk> too old to take to <unk> . ” “ How old ARE you , Phil ? ” asks the trooper , pausing as he <unk> his smoking <unk> to his lips .
“ I ’ m something with a eight in it , ” says Phil .
“ It can ’ t be <unk> .
Nor yet eighteen .
It ’ s <unk> ’ em , somewheres . ” Mr. George , slowly putting down his <unk> without <unk> its contents , is laughingly beginning , “ Why , what the <unk> , Phil — ” when he stops , seeing that Phil is <unk> on his dirty fingers .
“ I was just eight , ” says Phil , “ agreeable to the <unk> calculation , when I went with the <unk> .
I was sent on a errand , and I see him <unk> under a old <unk> with a fire all to himself wery comfortable , and he says , ‘ Would you like to come along a me , my man ? ’ I says ‘ Yes , ’ and him and me and the fire goes home to <unk> together .
That was <unk> <unk> Day .
I was able to <unk> up to ten ; and when <unk> <unk> Day come round again , I says to myself , ‘ Now , old chap , you ’ re one and a eight in it . ’ <unk> <unk> Day after that , I says , ‘ Now , old chap , you ’ re two and a eight in it . ’ In course of time , I come to ten and a eight in it ; two tens and a eight in it .
When it got so high , it got the upper hand of me , but this is how I always know there ’ s a eight in it . ” “ Ah ! ” says Mr. George , resuming his breakfast .
“ And where ’ s the <unk> ? ” “ <unk> put him in the hospital , guv ’ ner , and the hospital put him — in a <unk> , I HAVE heerd , ” Phil replies mysteriously .
“ By that means you got <unk> ?
Took the business , Phil ? ” “ Yes , commander , I took the business .
Such as it was .
It wasn ’ t much of a beat — round <unk> <unk> , <unk> Garden , <unk> , <unk> , and there — poor neighbourhood , where they uses up the <unk> till they ’ re past <unk> .
Most of the <unk> <unk> used to come and lodge at our place ; that was the best part of my master ’ s <unk> .
But they didn ’ t come to me .
I warn ’ t like him .
He could sing ’ em a good song .
I couldn ’ t !
He could play ’ em a tune on any sort of pot you please , so as it was iron or <unk> tin .
I never could do nothing with a pot but <unk> it or <unk> it — never had a note of music in me .
Besides , I was too <unk> , and their wives complained of me . ” “ They were mighty particular .
You would pass <unk> in a crowd , Phil ! ” says the trooper with a pleasant smile .
“ No , guv ’ ner , ” returns Phil , shaking his head .
“ No , I shouldn ’ t .
I was <unk> enough when I went with the <unk> , though nothing to boast of then ; but what with blowing the fire with my mouth when I was young , and <unk> my complexion , and <unk> my hair off , and <unk> the smoke , and what with being nat ’ rally <unk> ’ <unk> in the way of running against hot metal and <unk> myself by <unk> means , and what with having <unk> with the <unk> as I got older , almost whenever he was too far gone in drink — which was almost always — my beauty was queer , wery queer , even at that time .
As to since , what with a dozen years in a dark <unk> where the men was given to <unk> , and what with being <unk> in a accident at a <unk> , and what with being <unk> out of <unk> <unk> at the <unk> business , I am ugly enough to be made a show on ! ” <unk> himself to which condition with a perfectly satisfied manner , Phil begs the favour of another cup of coffee .
While drinking it , he says , “ It was after the <unk> <unk> when I first see you , commander .
You remember ? ” “ I remember , Phil .
You were walking along in the sun . ” “ <unk> , guv ’ ner , again a wall — ” “ True , Phil — <unk> your way on — ” “ In a <unk> ! ” exclaims Phil , excited .
“ In a <unk> — ” “ And <unk> with a couple of sticks ! ” cries Phil , still more excited .
“ With a couple of sticks .
When — ” “ When you stops , you know , ” cries Phil , putting down his cup and <unk> and hastily removing his plate from his knees , “ and says to me , ‘ What , comrade !
You have been in the <unk> ! ’ I didn ’ t say much to you , commander , then , for I was took by surprise that a person so strong and healthy and bold as you was should stop to speak to such a <unk> bag of bones as I was .
But you says to me , says you , delivering it out of your chest as hearty as possible , so that it was like a glass of something hot , ‘ What accident have you met with ?
You have been <unk> hurt .
What ’ s <unk> , old boy ?
<unk> up , and tell us about it ! ’ <unk> up !
I was <unk> already !
I says as much to you , you says more to me , I says more to you , you says more to me , and here I am , commander !
Here I am , commander ! ” cries Phil , who has started from his chair and <unk> begun to <unk> away .
“ If a mark ’ s wanted , or if it will improve the business , let the <unk> take <unk> at me .
They can ’ t spoil MY beauty .
I ’ M all right .
Come on !
If they want a man to box at , let ’ em box at me .
Let ’ em knock me well about the head .
I don ’ t mind .
If they want a <unk> to be <unk> for practice , <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , let ’ em throw me .
They won ’ t hurt ME .
I have been <unk> , all sorts of <unk> , all my life ! ” With this unexpected speech , <unk> delivered and accompanied by action <unk> of the various <unk> referred to , Phil Squod shoulders his way round three sides of the gallery , and <unk> <unk> off at his commander , makes a <unk> at him with his head , intended to express devotion to his service .
He then begins to clear away the breakfast .
Mr. George , after laughing cheerfully and clapping him on the shoulder , <unk> in these arrangements and <unk> to get the gallery into business order .
That done , he takes a turn at the <unk> , and afterwards <unk> himself and <unk> that he is getting “ too <unk> , ” engages with great gravity in solitary broadsword practice .
Meanwhile Phil has fallen to work at his usual table , where he <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and whistles into small <unk> , and <unk> himself more and more , and seems to do and <unk> everything that can be done and undone about a gun .
Master and man are at length disturbed by footsteps in the passage , where they make an unusual sound , <unk> the arrival of unusual company .
These steps , advancing nearer and nearer to the gallery , bring into it a <unk> at first sight scarcely <unk> with any day in the year but the <unk> of November .
It <unk> of a limp and ugly figure carried in a chair by two bearers and attended by a lean female with a face like a pinched <unk> , who might be expected immediately to <unk> the popular verses <unk> of the time when they did <unk> to blow Old England up alive but for her keeping her lips tightly and <unk> closed as the chair is put down .
At which point the figure in it <unk> , “ O Lord !
Oh , dear me !
I am shaken ! ” adds , “ How de do , my dear friend , how de do ? ” Mr. George then <unk> , in the procession , the venerable Mr. Smallweed out for an <unk> , attended by his granddaughter Judy as <unk> .
“ Mr.
George , my dear friend , ” says Grandfather Smallweed , removing his right arm from the neck of one of his bearers , whom he has nearly <unk> coming along , “ how de do ?
You ’ re surprised to see me , my dear friend . ” “ I should hardly have been more surprised to have seen your friend in the city , ” returns Mr. George .
“ I am very seldom out , ” <unk> Mr. Smallweed .
“ I haven ’ t been out for many months .
It ’ s inconvenient — and it comes expensive .
But I longed so much to see you , my dear Mr. George .
How de do , sir ? ” “ I am well enough , ” says Mr. George .
“ I hope you are the same . ” “ You can ’ t be too well , my dear friend . ” Mr. Smallweed takes him by both hands .
“ I have brought my granddaughter Judy .
I couldn ’ t keep her away .
She longed so much to see you . ” “ Hum !
She bears it calmly ! ” mutters Mr. George .
“ So we got a <unk> , and put a chair in it , and just round the corner they lifted me out of the cab and into the chair , and carried me here that I might see my dear friend in his own establishment !
This , ” says Grandfather Smallweed , <unk> to the <unk> , who has been in danger of <unk> and who withdraws adjusting his <unk> , “ is the driver of the cab .
He has nothing extra .
It is by agreement included in his <unk> .
This person , ” the other <unk> , “ we engaged in the street outside for a pint of beer .
Which is <unk> .
Judy , give the person <unk> .
I was not sure you had a workman of your own here , my dear friend , or we needn ’ t have employed this person . ” Grandfather Smallweed refers to Phil with a glance of considerable terror and a <unk> “ O Lord !
Oh , dear me ! ” Nor in his apprehension , on the surface of things , without some reason , for Phil , who has never beheld the <unk> in the <unk> cap before , has stopped short with a gun in his hand with much of the air of a dead shot intent on <unk> Mr. Smallweed off as an ugly old bird of the crow species .
“ Judy , my child , ” says Grandfather Smallweed , “ give the person his <unk> .
It ’ s a great deal for what he has done . ” The person , who is one of those extraordinary specimens of human <unk> that spring up <unk> in the <unk> streets of London , ready dressed in an old red <unk> , with a “ mission ” for holding horses and calling <unk> , received his <unk> with anything but <unk> , <unk> the money into the air , catches it <unk> , and retires .
“ My dear Mr. George , ” says Grandfather Smallweed , “ would you be so kind as help to carry me to the fire ?
I am accustomed to a fire , and I am an old man , and I soon <unk> .
Oh , dear me ! ” His closing exclamation is <unk> out of the venerable gentleman by the <unk> with which Mr. Squod , like a <unk> , catches him up , chair and all , and deposits him on the <unk> .
“ O Lord ! ” says Mr. Smallweed , panting .
“ Oh , dear me !
Oh , my stars !
My dear friend , your workman is very strong — and very <unk> .
O Lord , he is very <unk> !
Judy , draw me back a little .
I ’ m being <unk> in the legs , ” which indeed is <unk> to the <unk> of all present by the smell of his <unk> stockings .
The gentle Judy , having backed her grandfather a little way from the fire , and having shaken him up as usual , and having released his <unk> eye from its <unk> <unk> , Mr. Smallweed again says , “ Oh , dear me !
O Lord ! ” and looking about and meeting Mr. George ’ s glance , again stretches out both hands .
“ My dear friend !
So happy in this meeting !
And this is your establishment ?
It ’ s a delightful place .
It ’ s a picture !
You never find that anything goes off here accidentally , do you , my dear friend ? ” adds Grandfather Smallweed , very ill at ease .
“ No , no .
No fear of that . ” “ And your workman .
He — Oh , dear me ! — he never lets anything off without meaning it , does he , my dear friend ? ” “ He has never hurt anybody but himself , ” says Mr. George , smiling .
“ But he might , you know .
He seems to have hurt himself a good deal , and he might hurt somebody else , ” the old gentleman returns .
“ He <unk> ’ t mean it — or he even might .
Mr. George , will you order him to leave his infernal <unk> alone and go away ? ” <unk> to a nod from the trooper , Phil retires , <unk> , to the other end of the gallery .
Mr. Smallweed , reassured , falls to rubbing his legs .
“ And you ’ re doing well , Mr. George ? ” he says to the trooper , <unk> standing <unk> about towards him with his broadsword in his hand .
“ You are <unk> , please the <unk> ? ” Mr. George answers with a cool nod , adding , “ Go on .
You have not come to say that , I know . ” “ You are so sprightly , Mr. George , ” returns the venerable grandfather .
“ You are such good company . ” “ Ha ha !
Go on ! ” says Mr. George .
“ My dear friend !
But that <unk> looks awful <unk> and sharp .
It might cut somebody , by accident .
It makes me <unk> , Mr. George .
<unk> him ! ” says the excellent old gentleman apart to Judy as the trooper takes a step or two away to lay it aside .
“ He <unk> me money , and might think of paying off old scores in this <unk> place .
I wish your brimstone grandmother was here , and he ’ d <unk> her head off . ” Mr. George , returning , folds his arms , and looking down at the old man , sliding every moment lower and lower in his chair , says quietly , “ Now for it ! ” “ Ho ! ” cries Mr. Smallweed , rubbing his hands with an artful <unk> .
“ Yes .
Now for it .
Now for what , my dear friend ? ” “ For a pipe , ” says Mr. George , who with great composure sets his chair in the <unk> , takes his pipe from the grate , fills it and lights it , and falls to smoking <unk> .
This <unk> to the <unk> of Mr. Smallweed , who finds it so difficult to resume his object , whatever it may be , that he becomes <unk> and secretly <unk> the air with an <unk> <unk> expressive of an intense desire to tear and <unk> the <unk> of Mr. George .
As the excellent old gentleman ’ s <unk> are long and leaden , and his hands lean and <unk> , and his eyes green and <unk> ; and , over and above this , as he continues , while he <unk> , to <unk> down in his chair and to <unk> into a <unk> bundle , he becomes such a <unk> spectacle , even in the accustomed eyes of Judy , that that young <unk> <unk> at him with something more than the ardour of affection and so shakes him up and <unk> and pokes him in <unk> parts of his body , but particularly in that part which the science of <unk> would call his wind , that in his <unk> distress he utters <unk> sounds like a <unk> ’ s <unk> .
When Judy has by these means set him up again in his chair , with a white face and a frosty nose ( but still <unk> ) , she stretches out her <unk> forefinger and gives Mr. George one poke in the back .
The trooper raising his head , she makes another poke at her esteemed grandfather , and having thus brought them together , stares <unk> at the fire .
“ Aye , aye !
Ho , <unk> !
<unk> — <unk> — <unk> — <unk> ! ” <unk> Grandfather Smallweed , <unk> his rage .
“ My dear friend ! ” ( still <unk> ) .
“ I tell you what , ” says Mr. George .
“ If you want to <unk> with me , you must speak out .
I am one of the <unk> , and I can ’ t go about and about .
I haven ’ t the art to do it .
I am not clever enough .
It don ’ t suit me .
When you go winding round and round me , ” says the trooper , putting his pipe between his lips again , “ <unk> , if I don ’ t feel as if I was being smothered ! ” And he <unk> his broad chest to its utmost extent as if to assure himself that he is not smothered yet .
“ If you have come to give me a friendly call , ” continues Mr. George , “ I am obliged to you ; how are you ?
If you have come to see whether there ’ s any property on the premises , look about you ; you are welcome .
If you want to out with something , out with it ! ” The blooming Judy , without removing her gaze from the fire , gives her grandfather one ghostly poke .
“ You see !
It ’ s her opinion too .
And why the devil that young woman won ’ t sit down like a Christian , ” says Mr. George with his eyes <unk> fixed on Judy , “ I can ’ t comprehend . ” “ She keeps at my side to attend to me , sir , ” says Grandfather Smallweed .
“ I am an old man , my dear Mr. George , and I need some attention .
I can carry my years ; I am not a brimstone <unk> ” ( <unk> and looking unconsciously for the cushion ) , “ but I need attention , my dear friend . ” “ Well ! ” returns the trooper , <unk> his chair to face the old man .
“ Now then ? ” “ My friend in the city , Mr. George , has done a little business with a pupil of yours . ” “ Has he ? ” says Mr. George .
“ I am sorry to hear it . ” “ Yes , sir . ” Grandfather Smallweed rubs his legs .
“ He is a fine young soldier now , Mr. George , by the name of Carstone .
<unk> came forward and paid it all up , honourable . ” “ Did they ? ” returns Mr. George .
“ Do you think your friend in the city would like a piece of advice ? ” “ I think he would , my dear friend .
From you . ” “ I advise him , then , to do no more business in that quarter .
There ’ s no more to be got by it .
The young gentleman , to my knowledge , is brought to a dead <unk> . ” “ No , no , my dear friend .
No , no , Mr. George .
No , no , no , sir , ” remonstrates Grandfather Smallweed , <unk> rubbing his spare legs .
“ Not quite a dead <unk> , I think .
He has good friends , and he is good for his pay , and he is good for the <unk> price of his commission , and he is good for his chance in a <unk> , and he is good for his chance in a wife , and — oh , do you know , Mr. George , I think my friend would consider the young gentleman good for something yet ? ” says Grandfather Smallweed , turning up his velvet cap and <unk> his ear like a <unk> .
Mr. George , who has put aside his pipe and sits with an arm on his chair-back , beats a <unk> on the ground with his right foot as if he were not particularly pleased with the turn the conversation has taken .
“ But to pass from one subject to another , ” resumes Mr. Smallweed .
“ ‘ To <unk> the conversation , ’ as a <unk> might say .
To pass , Mr. George , from the <unk> to the captain . ” “ What are you up to , now ? ” asks Mr. George , pausing with a frown in <unk> the recollection of his <unk> .
“ What captain ? ” “ Our captain .
The captain we know of .
Captain Hawdon . ” “ Oh !
That ’ s it , is it ? ” says Mr. George with a low whistle as he sees both grandfather and granddaughter looking hard at him .
“ You are there !
Well ?
What about it ?
Come , I won ’ t be smothered any more .
Speak ! ” “ My dear friend , ” returns the old man , “ I was applied — Judy , shake me up a little ! — I was applied to yesterday about the captain , and my opinion still is that the captain is not dead . ” “ <unk> ! ” observes Mr. George .
“ What was your remark , my dear friend ? ” inquires the old man with his hand to his ear .
“ <unk> ! ” “ Ho ! ” says Grandfather Smallweed .
“ Mr.
George , of my opinion you can judge for yourself according to the questions asked of me and the reasons given for asking ’ em .
Now , what do you think the lawyer making the inquiries wants ? ” “ A job , ” says Mr. George .
“ Nothing of the kind ! ” “ Can ’ t be a lawyer , then , ” says Mr. George , folding his arms with an air of confirmed resolution .
“ My dear friend , he is a lawyer , and a famous one .
He wants to see some fragment in Captain Hawdon ’ s writing .
He don ’ t want to keep it .
He only wants to see it and <unk> it with a writing in his possession . ” “ Well ? ” “ Well , Mr. George .
<unk> to remember the <unk> concerning Captain Hawdon and any information that could be given respecting him , he looked it up and came to me — just as you did , my dear friend .
WILL you shake hands ?
So glad you came that day !
I should have missed <unk> such a friendship if you hadn ’ t come ! ” “ Well , Mr. Smallweed ? ” says Mr. George again after going through the ceremony with some <unk> .
“ I had no such thing .
I have nothing but his <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> murder and sudden death upon him , ” says the old man , making a <unk> out of one of his few remembrances of a prayer and <unk> up his velvet cap between his angry hands , “ I have half a million of his <unk> , I think !
But you , ” <unk> recovering his <unk> of speech as Judy <unk> the cap on his <unk> of a head , “ you , my dear Mr. George , are likely to have some letter or paper that would suit the purpose .
Anything would suit the purpose , written in the hand . ” “ Some writing in that hand , ” says the trooper , pondering ; “ may be , I have . ” “ My dearest friend ! ” “ May be , I have not . ” “ Ho ! ” says Grandfather Smallweed , <unk> .
“ But if I had <unk> of it , I would not show as much as would make a <unk> without knowing why . ” “ Sir , I have told you why .
My dear Mr. George , I have told you why . ” “ Not enough , ” says the trooper , shaking his head .
“ I must know more , and approve it . ” “ Then , will you come to the lawyer ?
My dear friend , will you come and see the gentleman ? ” <unk> Grandfather Smallweed , pulling out a lean old silver watch with hands like the leg of a skeleton .
“ I told him it was probable I might call upon him between ten and eleven this <unk> , and it ’ s now half after ten .
Will you come and see the gentleman , Mr. George ? ” “ Hum ! ” says he gravely .
“ I don ’ t mind that .
Though why this should concern you so much , I don ’ t know . ” “ Everything concerns me that has a chance in it of bringing anything to light about him .
<unk> ’ t he take us all in ?
<unk> ’ t he owe us immense <unk> , all round ?
<unk> me ?
Who can anything about him concern more than me ?
Not , my dear friend , ” says Grandfather Smallweed , lowering his tone , “ that I want YOU to <unk> anything .
<unk> from it .
Are you ready to come , my dear friend ? ” “ Aye !
I ’ ll come in a moment .
I promise nothing , you know . ” “ No , my dear Mr. George ; no . ” “ And you mean to say you ’ re going to give me a lift to this place , wherever it is , without <unk> for it ? ” Mr. George inquires , getting his hat and thick <unk> gloves .
This <unk> so <unk> Mr. Smallweed that he laughs , long and low , before the fire .
But ever while he laughs , he glances over his <unk> shoulder at Mr. George and <unk> watches him as he unlocks the <unk> of a homely cupboard at the distant end of the gallery , looks here and there upon the higher <unk> , and <unk> takes something out with a rustling of paper , folds it , and puts it in his breast .
Then Judy pokes Mr. Smallweed once , and Mr. Smallweed pokes Judy once .
“ I am ready , ” says the trooper , coming back .
“ Phil , you can carry this old gentleman to his coach , and make nothing of him . ” “ Oh , dear me !
O Lord !
Stop a moment ! ” says Mr. Smallweed .
“ He ’ s so very <unk> !
Are you sure you can do it carefully , my worthy man ? ” Phil makes no reply , but <unk> the chair and its load , <unk> away , tightly <unk> by the now speechless Mr. Smallweed , and <unk> along the passage as if he had an <unk> commission to carry the old gentleman to the nearest <unk> .
His <unk> trust , however , <unk> at the cab , he deposits him there ; and the fair Judy takes her place beside him , and the chair <unk> the roof , and Mr. George takes the vacant place upon the box .
Mr. George is quite <unk> by the spectacle he beholds from time to time as he peeps into the cab through the window behind him , where the grim Judy is always motionless , and the old gentleman with his cap over one eye is always sliding off the seat into the straw and looking upward at him out of his other eye with a helpless expression of being <unk> in the back .
CHAPTER <unk> More Old <unk> <unk> One Mr. George has not far to ride with folded arms upon the box , for their destination is Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields .
When the driver stops his horses , Mr. George alights , and looking in at the window , says , “ What , Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s your man , is he ? ” “ Yes , my dear friend .
Do you know him , Mr. George ? ” “ Why , I have heard of him — seen him too , I think .
But I don ’ t know him , and he don ’ t know me . ” There <unk> the carrying of Mr. Smallweed upstairs , which is done to perfection with the trooper ’ s help .
He is borne into Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s great room and deposited on the <unk> <unk> before the fire .
Mr. Tulkinghorn is not within at the present moment but will be back directly .
The <unk> of the pew in the hall , having said thus much , stirs the fire and leaves the <unk> to warm themselves .
Mr. George is <unk> curious in respect of the room .
He looks up at the painted ceiling , looks round at the old <unk> , <unk> the portraits of the great clients , reads aloud the names on the boxes .
“ ‘ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ’ ” Mr. George reads thoughtfully .
“ Ha !
‘ <unk> of Chesney Wold . ’ <unk> ! ” Mr. George stands looking at these boxes a long while — as if they were pictures — and comes back to the fire repeating , “ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and <unk> of Chesney Wold , <unk> ? ” “ <unk> a <unk> of money , Mr. George ! ” whispers Grandfather Smallweed , rubbing his legs .
“ <unk> rich ! ” “ Who do you mean ?
This old gentleman , or the Baronet ? ” “ This gentleman , this gentleman . ” “ So I have heard ; and knows a thing or two , I ’ ll hold a wager .
Not bad quarters , either , ” says Mr. George , looking round again .
“ See the <unk> yonder ! ” This reply is cut short by Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s arrival .
There is no change in him , of course .
<unk> <unk> , with his spectacles in his hand , and their very case worn threadbare .
In manner , close and dry .
In voice , <unk> and low .
In face , watchful behind a blind ; habitually not <unk> and <unk> perhaps .
The peerage may have <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> than Mr. Tulkinghorn , after all , if everything were known .
“ Good morning , Mr. Smallweed , good morning ! ” he says as he comes in .
“ You have brought the sergeant , I see .
Sit down , sergeant . ” As Mr. Tulkinghorn takes off his gloves and puts them in his hat , he looks with <unk> eyes across the room to where the trooper stands and says within himself <unk> , “ You ’ ll do , my friend ! ” “ Sit down , sergeant , ” he repeats as he comes to his table , which is set on one side of the fire , and takes his easy-chair .
“ <unk> and raw this morning , cold and raw ! ” Mr. Tulkinghorn <unk> before the bars , <unk> , the <unk> and knuckles of his hands and looks ( from behind that blind which is always down ) at the <unk> sitting in a little <unk> before him .
“ Now , I can feel what I am about ” ( as perhaps he can in two senses ) , “ Mr.
Smallweed . ” The old gentleman is newly shaken up by Judy to bear his part in the conversation .
“ You have brought our good friend the sergeant , I see . ” “ Yes , sir , ” returns Mr. Smallweed , very <unk> to the lawyer ’ s wealth and influence .
“ And what does the sergeant say about this business ? ” “ Mr.
George , ” says Grandfather Smallweed with a <unk> wave of his <unk> hand , “ this is the gentleman , sir . ” Mr. George <unk> the gentleman but otherwise sits <unk> upright and profoundly silent — very forward in his chair , as if the full <unk> of <unk> <unk> for a <unk> hung about him .
Mr. Tulkinghorn proceeds , “ Well , George — I believe your name is George ? ” “ It is so , Sir . ” “ What do you say , George ? ” “ I ask your pardon , sir , ” returns the trooper , “ but I should wish to know what YOU say ? ” “ Do you mean in point of reward ? ” “ I mean in point of everything , sir . ” This is so very trying to Mr. Smallweed ’ s temper that he suddenly breaks out with “ You ’ re a brimstone <unk> ! ” and as suddenly asks pardon of Mr. Tulkinghorn , <unk> himself for this slip of the tongue by saying to Judy , “ I was thinking of your grandmother , my dear . ” “ I supposed , sergeant , ” Mr. Tulkinghorn resumes as he leans on one side of his chair and crosses his legs , “ that Mr. Smallweed might have sufficiently explained the matter .
It lies in the <unk> <unk> , however .
You served under Captain Hawdon at one time , and were his attendant in illness , and rendered him many little services , and were rather in his confidence , I am told .
That is so , is it not ? ” “ Yes , sir , that is so , ” says Mr. George with military <unk> .
“ Therefore you may happen to have in your possession something — anything , no matter what ; accounts , instructions , orders , a letter , anything — in Captain Hawdon ’ s writing .
I wish to <unk> his writing with some that I have .
If you can give me the opportunity , you shall be <unk> for your trouble .
Three , four , five , guineas , you would consider handsome , I dare say . ” “ <unk> , my dear friend ! ” cries Grandfather Smallweed , <unk> up his eyes .
“ If not , say how much more , in your conscience as a soldier , you can <unk> .
There is no need for you to part with the writing , against your inclination — though I should prefer to have it . ” Mr. George sits squared in exactly the same attitude , looks at the painted ceiling , and says never a word .
The <unk> Mr. Smallweed <unk> the air .
“ The question is , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn in his <unk> , subdued , <unk> way , “ first , whether you have any of Captain Hawdon ’ s writing ? ” “ First , whether I have any of Captain Hawdon ’ s writing , sir , ” repeats Mr. George .
“ Secondly , what will satisfy you for the trouble of producing it ? ” “ Secondly , what will satisfy me for the trouble of producing it , sir , ” repeats Mr. George .
“ <unk> , you can judge for yourself whether it is at all like that , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , suddenly <unk> him some sheets of written paper tied together .
“ Whether it is at all like that , sir .
Just so , ” repeats Mr. George .
All three <unk> Mr. George <unk> in a <unk> manner , looking straight at Mr. Tulkinghorn ; nor does he so much as glance at the affidavit in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , that has been given to him for his <unk> ( though he still holds it in his hand ) , but continues to look at the lawyer with an air of troubled <unk> .
“ Well ? ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ What do you say ? ” “ Well , sir , ” replies Mr. George , rising <unk> and looking immense , “ I would rather , if you ’ ll excuse me , have nothing to do with this . ” Mr. Tulkinghorn , outwardly quite <unk> , demands , “ Why not ? ” “ Why , sir , ” returns the trooper .
“ Except on military <unk> , I am not a man of business .
Among <unk> I am what they call in <unk> a <unk> ’ <unk> .
I have no head for papers , sir .
I can stand any fire better than a fire of cross questions .
I mentioned to Mr. Smallweed , only an hour or so ago , that when I come into things of this kind I feel as if I was being smothered .
And that is my sensation , ” says Mr. George , looking round upon the company , “ at the present moment . ” With that , he takes three strides forward to <unk> the papers on the lawyer ’ s table and three strides backward to resume his former station , where he stands perfectly upright , now looking at the ground and now at the painted ceiling , with his hands behind him as if to prevent himself from <unk> any other document whatever .
Under this <unk> , Mr. Smallweed ’ s favourite <unk> of <unk> is so close to his tongue that he begins the words “ my dear friend ” with the <unk> “ <unk> , ” thus <unk> the <unk> <unk> into <unk> and appearing to have an <unk> in his speech .
Once past this difficulty , however , he <unk> his dear friend in the <unk> manner not to be rash , but to do what so eminent a gentleman requires , and to do it with a good grace , confident that it must be <unk> as well as <unk> .
Mr. Tulkinghorn merely utters an occasional sentence , as , “ You are the best judge of your own interest , sergeant . ” “ Take care you do no harm by this . ” “ Please yourself , please yourself . ” “ If you know what you mean , that ’ s quite enough . ” These he utters with an appearance of perfect indifference as he looks over the papers on his table and prepares to write a letter .
Mr. George looks <unk> from the painted ceiling to the ground , from the ground to Mr. Smallweed , from Mr. Smallweed to Mr. Tulkinghorn , and from Mr. Tulkinghorn to the painted ceiling again , often in his perplexity changing the leg on which he rests .
“ I do assure you , sir , ” says Mr. George , “ not to say it <unk> , that between you and Mr. Smallweed here , I really am being smothered fifty times over .
I really am , sir .
I am not a <unk> for you gentlemen .
Will you allow me to ask why you want to see the captain ’ s hand , in the case that I could find any <unk> of it ? ” Mr. Tulkinghorn quietly shakes his head .
“ No .
If you were a man of business , sergeant , you would not need to be informed that there are confidential reasons , very harmless in themselves , for many such wants in the profession to which I belong .
But if you are afraid of doing any injury to Captain Hawdon , you may set your mind at rest about that . ” “ Aye !
He is dead , sir . ” “ IS he ? ” Mr. Tulkinghorn quietly sits down to write .
“ Well , sir , ” says the trooper , looking into his hat after another disconcerted pause , “ I am sorry not to have given you more satisfaction .
If it would be any satisfaction to any one that I should be confirmed in my judgment that I would rather have nothing to do with this by a friend of mine who has a better head for business than I have , and who is an old soldier , I am willing to consult with him .
I — I really am so completely smothered myself at present , ” says Mr. George , passing his hand <unk> across his brow , “ that I don ’ t know but what it might be a satisfaction to me . ” Mr. Smallweed , hearing that this authority is an old soldier , so strongly <unk> the <unk> of the trooper ’ s taking counsel with him , and particularly informing him of its being a question of five guineas or more , that Mr. George engages to go and see him .
Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing either way .
“ I ’ ll consult my friend , then , by your leave , sir , ” says the trooper , “ and I ’ ll take the liberty of looking in again with the final answer in the course of the day .
Mr. Smallweed , if you wish to be carried downstairs — ” “ In a moment , my dear friend , in a moment .
Will you first let me speak half a word with this gentleman in private ? ” “ Certainly , sir .
Don ’ t hurry yourself on my account . ” The trooper retires to a distant part of the room and resumes his curious <unk> of the boxes , strong and otherwise .
“ If I wasn ’ t as weak as a brimstone baby , sir , ” whispers Grandfather Smallweed , drawing the lawyer down to his level by the <unk> of his coat and <unk> some <unk> green fire out of his angry eyes , “ I ’ d tear the writing away from him .
He ’ s got it buttoned in his breast .
I saw him put it there .
Judy saw him put it there .
Speak up , you <unk> image for the sign of a <unk> shop , and say you saw him put it there ! ” This vehement <unk> the old gentleman accompanies with such a <unk> at his granddaughter that it is too much for his strength , and he <unk> away out of his chair , drawing Mr. Tulkinghorn with him , until he is arrested by Judy , and well shaken .
“ <unk> will not do for me , my friend , ” Mr. Tulkinghorn then remarks coolly .
“ No , no , I know , I know , sir .
But it ’ s <unk> and <unk> — it ’ s — it ’ s worse than your <unk> chattering <unk> of a grandmother , ” to the imperturbable Judy , who only looks at the fire , “ to know he has got what ’ s wanted and won ’ t give it up .
He , not to give it up !
HE !
A vagabond !
But never mind , sir , never mind .
At the most , he has only his own way for a little while .
I have him <unk> in a <unk> .
I ’ ll twist him , sir .
I ’ ll <unk> him , sir .
If he won ’ t do it with a good grace , I ’ ll make him do it with a bad one , sir !
Now , my dear Mr. George , ” says Grandfather Smallweed , winking at the lawyer <unk> as he <unk> him , “ I am ready for your kind assistance , my excellent friend ! ” Mr. Tulkinghorn , with some shadowy sign of amusement <unk> itself through his <unk> , stands on the <unk> with his back to the fire , watching the <unk> of Mr. Smallweed and <unk> the trooper ’ s parting salute with one slight nod .
It is more difficult to get rid of the old gentleman , Mr. George finds , than to bear a hand in carrying him downstairs , for when he is <unk> in his <unk> , he is so <unk> on the subject of the guineas and <unk> such an affectionate hold of his <unk> — having , in truth , a secret <unk> to <unk> his coat open and <unk> him — that some degree of force is necessary on the trooper ’ s part to effect a separation .
It is accomplished at last , and he proceeds alone in <unk> of his adviser .
By the <unk> Temple , and by <unk> ( there , not without a glance at <unk> <unk> , which would seem to be something in his way ) , and by <unk> <unk> , and <unk> Road , Mr. George <unk> marches to a street of little shops lying somewhere in that <unk> of roads from <unk> and <unk> , and of streets from the bridges of London , <unk> in the <unk> <unk> who has lost his <unk> formed of a thousand <unk> <unk> to a stronger iron monster than he , ready to <unk> him into <unk> any day he <unk> .
To one of the little shops in this street , which is a <unk> ’ s shop , having a few <unk> in the window , and some <unk> ’ s pipes and a <unk> , and a <unk> , and certain <unk> scraps of music , Mr. George directs his massive tread .
And <unk> at a few paces from it , as he sees a soldierly looking woman , with her outer skirts <unk> up , come forth with a small wooden tub , and in that tub <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> of the pavement , Mr. George says to himself , “ She ’ s as usual , washing greens .
I never saw her , except upon a <unk> , when she wasn ’ t washing greens ! ” The subject of this reflection is at all events so occupied in washing greens at present that she remains <unk> of Mr. George ’ s approach until , lifting up herself and her tub together when she has poured the water off into the <unk> , she finds him standing near her .
Her reception of him is not <unk> .
“ George , I never see you but I wish you was a hundred mile away ! ” The trooper , without <unk> on this welcome , follows into the <unk> shop , where the lady places her tub of greens upon the counter , and having shaken hands with him , rests her arms upon it .
“ I never , ” she says , “ George , consider Matthew Bagnet safe a minute when you ’ re near him .
You are that restless and that <unk> — ” “ Yes !
I know I am , Mrs. Bagnet .
I know I am . ” “ You know you are ! ” says Mrs. Bagnet .
“ What ’ s the use of that ?
<unk> are you ? ” “ The nature of the animal , I suppose , ” returns the trooper good-humouredly .
“ Ah ! ” cries Mrs. Bagnet , something <unk> .
“ But what satisfaction will the nature of the animal be to me when the animal shall have tempted my Mat away from the musical business to New <unk> or <unk> ? ” Mrs. Bagnet is not at all an <unk> woman .
<unk> <unk> , a little coarse in the <unk> , and <unk> by the sun and wind which have <unk> her hair upon the forehead , but healthy , wholesome , and bright-eyed .
A strong , busy , active , <unk> woman of from <unk> to fifty .
<unk> , <unk> , and so <unk> dressed ( though <unk> ) that the only article of <unk> of which she stands possessed appear ’ s to be her <unk> , around which her finger has grown to be so large since it was put on that it will never come off again until it shall <unk> with Mrs. Bagnet ’ s dust .
“ Mrs.
Bagnet , ” says the trooper , “ I am on my <unk> with you .
Mat will get no harm from me .
You may trust me so far . ” “ Well , I think I may .
But the very looks of you are <unk> , ” Mrs. Bagnet rejoins .
“ Ah , George , George !
If you had only settled down and married <unk> <unk> ’ s widow when he died in North America , <unk> ’ D have <unk> your hair for you . ” “ It was a chance for me , certainly , ” returns the trooper half laughingly , half seriously , “ but I shall never settle down into a respectable man now .
<unk> <unk> ’ s widow might have done me good — there was something in her , and something of her — but I couldn ’ t make up my mind to it .
If I had had the luck to meet with such a wife as Mat found ! ” Mrs. Bagnet , who seems in a <unk> way to be under little reserve with a good sort of fellow , but to be another good sort of fellow herself for that matter , receives this compliment by <unk> Mr. George in the face with a head of greens and taking her tub into the little room behind the shop .
“ Why , Quebec , my <unk> , ” says George , following , on <unk> , into that <unk> .
“ And little Malta , too !
Come and kiss your Bluffy ! ” These young ladies — not supposed to have been actually christened by the names applied to them , though always so called in the family from the places of their birth in <unk> — are <unk> employed on <unk> <unk> , the younger ( some five or six years old ) in <unk> her letters out of a penny <unk> , the elder ( eight or nine perhaps ) in teaching her and <unk> with great <unk> .
Both <unk> Mr. George with <unk> as an old friend and after some kissing and <unk> <unk> their <unk> beside him .
“ And how ’ s young Woolwich ? ” says Mr. George .
“ Ah !
There now ! ” cries Mrs. Bagnet , turning about from her <unk> ( for she is <unk> dinner ) with a bright flush on her face .
“ Would you believe it ?
<unk> an engagement at the <unk> , with his father , to play the fife in a military piece . ” “ Well done , my godson ! ” cries Mr. George , <unk> his <unk> .
“ I believe you ! ” says Mrs. Bagnet .
“ He ’ s a <unk> .
That ’ s what Woolwich is .
A <unk> ! ” “ And Mat blows away at his bassoon , and you ’ re respectable <unk> one and all , ” says Mr. George .
“ Family people .
<unk> growing up .
Mat ’ s old mother in <unk> , and your old father somewhere else , <unk> with , and helped a little , and — well , well !
To be sure , I don ’ t know why I shouldn ’ t be wished a hundred mile away , for I have not much to do with all this ! ” Mr. George is becoming thoughtful , sitting before the fire in the whitewashed room , which has a <unk> floor and a <unk> smell and <unk> nothing superfluous and has not a visible speck of dirt or dust in it , from the faces of Quebec and Malta to the bright tin pots and <unk> upon the <unk> <unk> — Mr.
George is becoming thoughtful , sitting here while Mrs. Bagnet is busy , when Mr. Bagnet and young Woolwich <unk> come home .
Mr. Bagnet is an <unk> , tall and upright , with <unk> eyebrows and whiskers like the <unk> of a <unk> , not a hair upon his head , and a <unk> complexion .
His voice , short , deep , and <unk> , is not at all unlike the tones of the instrument to which he is devoted .
Indeed there may be generally observed in him an <unk> , <unk> , <unk> air , as if he were himself the bassoon of the human <unk> .
Young Woolwich is the <unk> and model of a young <unk> .
Both father and son salute the trooper heartily .
He saying , in due season , that he has come to advise with Mr. Bagnet , Mr. Bagnet <unk> declares that he will hear of no business until after dinner and that his friend shall not partake of his counsel without first <unk> of <unk> pork and greens .
The trooper yielding to this <unk> , he and Mr. Bagnet , not to <unk> the domestic preparations , go forth to take a turn up and down the little street , which they <unk> with <unk> tread and folded arms , as if it were a <unk> .
“ George , ” says Mr. Bagnet .
“ You know me .
It ’ s my old girl that <unk> .
She has the head .
But I never own to it before her .
Discipline must be maintained .
<unk> till the greens is off her mind .
Then we ’ ll consult .
Whatever the old girl says , do — do it ! ” “ I intend to , Mat , ” replies the other .
“ I would sooner take her opinion than that of a <unk> . ” “ <unk> , ” returns Mr. Bagnet in short <unk> , <unk> .
“ What <unk> could you leave — in another quarter of the world — with nothing but a grey cloak and an umbrella — to make its way home to Europe ?
The old girl would do it to-morrow .
Did it once ! ” “ You are right , ” says Mr. George .
“ What <unk> , ” pursues Bagnet , “ could you set up in life — with two <unk> ’ <unk> of white <unk> — a <unk> ’ <unk> of <unk> ’ s earth — a ha ’ <unk> of <unk> — and the rest of the change out of sixpence in money ?
That ’ s what the old girl started on .
In the present business . ” “ I am rejoiced to hear it ’ s <unk> , Mat . ” “ The old girl , ” says Mr. Bagnet , <unk> , “ <unk> .
Has a <unk> somewhere .
With money in it .
I never saw it .
But I know she ’ s got it .
<unk> till the greens is off her mind .
Then she ’ ll set you up . ” “ She is a <unk> ! ” exclaims Mr. George .
“ She ’ s more .
But I never own to it before her .
Discipline must be maintained .
It was the old girl that brought out my musical <unk> .
I should have been in the <unk> now but for the old girl .
Six years I <unk> at the <unk> .
Ten at the <unk> .
The old girl said it wouldn ’ t do ; intention good , but want of <unk> ; try the bassoon .
The old girl borrowed a bassoon from the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> on , got another , get a living by it ! ” George remarks that she looks as fresh as a rose and as sound as an <unk> .
“ The old girl , ” says Mr. Bagnet in reply , “ is a thoroughly fine woman .
Consequently she is like a thoroughly fine day .
<unk> finer as she gets on .
I never saw the old girl ’ s equal .
But I never own to it before her .
Discipline must be maintained ! ” <unk> to <unk> on indifferent matters , they walk up and down the little street , keeping step and time , until <unk> by Quebec and Malta to do justice to the pork and greens , over which Mrs. Bagnet , like a military <unk> , says a short grace .
In the distribution of these <unk> , as in every other household duty , Mrs. Bagnet <unk> an exact system , sitting with every dish before her , <unk> to every portion of pork its own portion of <unk> , greens , potatoes , and even <unk> , and <unk> it out complete .
Having likewise served out the beer from a can and thus <unk> the <unk> with all things necessary , Mrs. Bagnet proceeds to satisfy her own <unk> , which is in a healthy state .
The kit of the <unk> , if the table furniture may be so <unk> , is chiefly composed of <unk> of <unk> and tin that have done duty in several parts of the world .
Young Woolwich ’ s knife , in particular , which is of the oyster kind , with the additional feature of a strong <unk> movement which frequently <unk> the appetite of that young <unk> , is mentioned as having gone in various hands the complete round of foreign service .
The dinner done , Mrs. Bagnet , assisted by the younger branches ( who polish their own <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) , makes all the dinner <unk> shine as brightly as before and puts it all away , first sweeping the hearth , to the end that Mr. Bagnet and the visitor may not be <unk> in the smoking of their pipes .
These household cares involve much <unk> and <unk> in the backyard and considerable use of a <unk> , which is finally so happy as to assist in the <unk> of Mrs. Bagnet herself .
That old girl <unk> by and by , quite fresh , and sitting down to her needlework , then and only then — the greens being only then to be considered as entirely off her mind — Mr.
Bagnet <unk> the trooper to state his case .
This Mr. George does with great <unk> , appearing to address himself to Mr. Bagnet , but having an eye <unk> on the old girl all the time , as Bagnet has himself .
She , equally <unk> , <unk> herself with her needlework .
The case fully stated , Mr. Bagnet <unk> to his <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of discipline .
“ That ’ s the whole of it , is it , George ? ” says he .
“ That ’ s the whole of it . ” “ You act according to my opinion ? ” “ I shall be guided , ” replies George , “ entirely by it . ” “ Old girl , ” says Mr. Bagnet , “ give him my opinion .
You know it .
Tell him what it is . ” It is that he cannot have too little to do with people who are too deep for him and cannot be too careful of <unk> with matters he does not understand — that the plain <unk> is to do nothing in the dark , to be a party to nothing <unk> or mysterious , and never to put his foot where he cannot see the ground .
This , in effect , is Mr. Bagnet ’ s opinion , as delivered through the old girl , and it so <unk> Mr. George ’ s mind by <unk> his own opinion and <unk> his doubts that he <unk> himself to smoke another pipe on that <unk> occasion and to have a talk over old times with the whole Bagnet family , according to their various <unk> of experience .
Through these means it comes to pass that Mr. George does not again rise to his full height in that parlour until the time is drawing on when the bassoon and fife are expected by a British public at the theatre ; and as it takes time even then for Mr. George , in his domestic character of Bluffy , to take leave of Quebec and Malta and <unk> a <unk> shilling into the pocket of his godson with <unk> on his success in life , it is dark when Mr. George again turns his face towards Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields .
“ A family home , ” he <unk> as he marches along , “ however small it is , makes a man like me look lonely .
But it ’ s well I never made that <unk> of <unk> .
I shouldn ’ t have been fit for it .
I am such a vagabond still , even at my present time of life , that I couldn ’ t hold to the gallery a month together if it was a regular pursuit or if I didn ’ t <unk> there , <unk> fashion .
Come !
I disgrace nobody and <unk> nobody ; that ’ s something .
I have not done that for many a long year ! ” So he whistles it off and marches on .
<unk> in Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields and <unk> Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s <unk> , he finds the outer door closed and the chambers shut , but the trooper not knowing much about outer doors , and the staircase being dark besides , he is yet <unk> and groping about , hoping to <unk> a <unk> or to open the door for himself , when Mr. Tulkinghorn comes up the stairs ( quietly , of course ) and angrily asks , “ Who is that ?
What are you doing there ? ” “ I ask your pardon , sir .
It ’ s George .
The sergeant . ” “ And couldn ’ t George , the sergeant , see that my door was locked ? ” “ Why , no , sir , I couldn ’ t .
At any rate , I didn ’ t , ” says the trooper , rather <unk> .
“ Have you changed your mind ?
Or are you in the same mind ? ” Mr. Tulkinghorn demands .
But he knows well enough at a glance .
“ In the same mind , sir . ” “ I thought so .
That ’ s sufficient .
You can go .
So you are the man , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , opening his door with the key , “ in whose <unk> Mr. Gridley was found ? ” “ Yes , I AM the man , ” says the trooper , stopping two or three stairs down .
“ What then , sir ? ” “ What then ?
I don ’ t like your <unk> .
You should not have seen the inside of my door this morning if I had thought of your being that man .
Gridley ?
A threatening , murderous , dangerous fellow . ” With these words , spoken in an <unk> high tone for him , the lawyer goes into his rooms and shuts the door with a thundering noise .
Mr. George takes his <unk> in great <unk> , the greater because a clerk coming up the stairs has heard the last words of all and evidently <unk> them to him .
“ A pretty character to bear , ” the trooper <unk> with a hasty oath as he strides downstairs .
“ A threatening , murderous , dangerous fellow ! ” And looking up , he sees the clerk looking down at him and <unk> him as he passes a lamp .
This so <unk> his <unk> that for five minutes he is in an ill humour .
But he whistles that off like the rest of it and marches home to the shooting gallery .
CHAPTER <unk> The <unk> Sir Leicester Dedlock has got the better , for the time being , of the family gout and is once more , in a literal no less than in a <unk> point of view , upon his legs .
He is at his place in Lincolnshire ; but the waters are out again on the <unk> grounds , and the cold and damp steal into Chesney Wold , though well <unk> , and <unk> into Sir Leicester ’ s bones .
The blazing fires of <unk> and coal — Dedlock timber and <unk> <unk> — that blaze upon the broad wide <unk> and wink in the twilight on the frowning woods , <unk> to see how trees are <unk> , do not <unk> the enemy .
The <unk> pipes that <unk> themselves all over the house , the <unk> doors and windows , and the screens and curtains fail to <unk> the fires ’ <unk> and to satisfy Sir Leicester ’ s need .
Hence the fashionable intelligence <unk> one morning to the listening earth that Lady Dedlock is expected shortly to return to town for a few weeks .
It is a melancholy truth that even great men have their poor relations .
Indeed great men have often more than their fair share of poor relations , <unk> as very red blood of the superior quality , like <unk> blood <unk> shed , WILL cry aloud and WILL be heard .
Sir Leicester ’ s cousins , in the remotest degree , are so many <unk> in the respect that they “ will out . ” Among whom there are cousins who are so poor that one might almost dare to think it would have been the happier for them never to have been <unk> <unk> upon the Dedlock chain of gold , but to have been made of common iron at first and done base service .
<unk> , however ( with a few limited <unk> , genteel but not <unk> ) , they may not do , being of the Dedlock dignity .
So they visit their richer cousins , and get into debt when they can , and live but <unk> when they can ’ t , and find — the women no husbands , and the men no wives — and ride in borrowed carriages , and sit at <unk> that are never of their own making , and so go through high life .
The rich family sum has been divided by so many figures , and they are the something over that nobody knows what to do with .
Everybody on Sir Leicester Dedlock ’ s side of the question and of his way of thinking would appear to be his cousin more or less .
From my Lord Boodle , through the <unk> of <unk> , down to <unk> , Sir Leicester , like a glorious <unk> , stretches his <unk> of relationship .
But while he is stately in the <unk> of the <unk> , he is a kind and generous man , according to his dignified way , in the <unk> of the <unk> ; and at the present time , in <unk> of the damp , he <unk> out the visit of several such cousins at Chesney Wold with the constancy of a <unk> .
Of these , foremost in the front <unk> stands Volumnia Dedlock , a young lady ( of <unk> ) who is <unk> highly related , having the honour to be a poor relation , by the mother ’ s side , to another great family .
Miss Volumnia , displaying in early life a pretty talent for cutting ornaments out of coloured paper , and also for singing to the <unk> in the <unk> tongue , and <unk> French <unk> in country houses , passed the twenty years of her existence between twenty and forty in a sufficiently agreeable manner .
<unk> then out of date and being considered to bore mankind by her <unk> <unk> in the <unk> language , she retired to Bath , where she lives <unk> on an <unk> present from Sir Leicester and whence she makes occasional <unk> in the country houses of her cousins .
She has an <unk> acquaintance at Bath among <unk> old gentlemen with thin legs and <unk> <unk> , and is of high standing in that dreary city .
But she is a little <unk> elsewhere in consequence of an <unk> <unk> in the article of rouge and <unk> in an <unk> pearl necklace like a <unk> of little bird ’ <unk> .
In any country in a wholesome state , Volumnia would be a clear case for the <unk> list .
<unk> have been made to get her on it , and when William Buffy came in , it was fully expected that her name would be put down for a couple of hundred a year .
But William Buffy somehow discovered , contrary to all expectation , that these were not the times when it could be done , and this was the first clear indication Sir Leicester Dedlock had conveyed to him that the country was going to pieces .
There is likewise the Honourable Bob Stables , who can make warm <unk> with the skill of a <unk> surgeon and is a better shot than most <unk> .
He has been for some time particularly desirous to serve his country in a post of good <unk> , <unk> by any trouble or responsibility .
In a <unk> body <unk> this natural desire on the part of a <unk> young gentleman so highly connected would be <unk> recognized , but somehow William Buffy found when he came in that these were not times in which he could manage that little matter either , and this was the second indication Sir Leicester Dedlock had conveyed to him that the country was going to pieces .
The rest of the cousins are ladies and gentlemen of various ages and <unk> , the <unk> part amiable and sensible and likely to have done well enough in life if they could have overcome their <unk> ; as it is , they are almost all a little <unk> by it , and <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and seem to be quite as much at a loss how to dispose of themselves as anybody else can be how to dispose of them .
In this society , and where not , my Lady Dedlock <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , elegant , accomplished , and powerful in her little world ( for the world of fashion does not stretch <unk> the way from <unk> to <unk> ) , her influence in Sir Leicester ’ s house , however haughty and indifferent her manner , is greatly to improve it and <unk> it .
The cousins , even those older cousins who were <unk> when Sir Leicester married her , do her <unk> homage ; and the Honourable Bob Stables daily repeats to some chosen person between breakfast and <unk> his favourite original remark , that she is the <unk> woman in the whole <unk> .
Such the guests in the long drawing-room at Chesney Wold this dismal night when the step on the Ghost ’ s Walk ( <unk> here , however ) might be the step of a deceased cousin shut out in the cold .
It is near <unk> .
<unk> fires blaze brightly all over the house , raising ghosts of grim furniture on wall and ceiling .
<unk> candlesticks <unk> on the distant table by the door , and cousins <unk> on <unk> .
<unk> at the piano , cousins at the <unk> tray , cousins rising from the <unk> , cousins gathered round the fire .
<unk> on one side of his own peculiar fire ( for there are two ) , Sir Leicester .
On the opposite side of the broad hearth , my Lady at her table .
Volumnia , as one of the more <unk> cousins , in a <unk> chair between them .
Sir Leicester glancing , with magnificent displeasure , at the rouge and the pearl necklace .
“ I occasionally meet on my staircase here , ” <unk> Volumnia , whose thoughts perhaps are already hopping up it to bed , after a long evening of very <unk> talk , “ one of the <unk> girls , I think , that I ever saw in my life . ” “ A <unk> <unk> <unk> of my Lady ’ s , ” observes Sir Leicester .
“ I thought so .
I felt sure that some uncommon eye must have picked that girl out .
She really is a <unk> .
A <unk> sort of beauty perhaps , ” says Miss Volumnia , <unk> her own sort , “ but in its way , perfect ; such bloom I never saw ! ” Sir Leicester , with his magnificent glance of displeasure at the rouge , appears to say so too .
“ Indeed , ” remarks my Lady languidly , “ if there is any uncommon eye in the case , it is Mrs. Rouncewell ’ s , and not mine .
Rosa is her discovery . ” “ Your maid , I suppose ? ” “ No .
My anything ; pet — <unk> — messenger — I don ’ t know what . ” “ You like to have her about you , as you would like to have a flower , or a bird , or a picture , or a <unk> — no , not a <unk> , though — or anything else that was equally pretty ? ” says Volumnia , <unk> .
“ Yes , how charming now !
And how well that delightful old soul Mrs. Rouncewell is looking .
She must be an immense age , and yet she is as active and handsome !
She is the dearest friend I have , positively ! ” Sir Leicester feels it to be right and <unk> that the housekeeper of Chesney Wold should be a remarkable person .
<unk> from that , he has a real regard for Mrs. Rouncewell and likes to hear her praised .
So he says , “ You are right , Volumnia , ” which Volumnia is extremely glad to hear .
“ She has no daughter of her own , has she ? ” “ Mrs.
Rouncewell ?
No , Volumnia .
She has a son .
Indeed , she had two . ” My Lady , whose <unk> <unk> of <unk> has been <unk> <unk> by Volumnia this evening , glances <unk> towards the candlesticks and <unk> a <unk> sigh .
“ And it is a remarkable example of the confusion into which the present age has fallen ; of the <unk> of <unk> , the opening of floodgates , and the <unk> of <unk> , ” says Sir Leicester with stately gloom , “ that I have been informed by Mr. Tulkinghorn that Mrs. Rouncewell ’ s son has been invited to go into Parliament . ” Miss Volumnia utters a little sharp scream .
“ Yes , indeed , ” repeats Sir Leicester .
“ Into Parliament . ” “ I never heard of such a thing !
Good gracious , what is the man ? ” exclaims Volumnia .
“ He is called , I believe — an — ironmaster . ” Sir Leicester says it slowly and with gravity and doubt , as not being sure but that he is called a <unk> or that the right word may be some other word expressive of some other relationship to some other metal .
Volumnia utters another little scream .
“ He has <unk> the proposal , if my information from Mr. Tulkinghorn be correct , as I have no doubt it is .
Mr. Tulkinghorn being always correct and exact ; still that does not , ” says Sir Leicester , “ that does not <unk> the <unk> , which is <unk> with strange considerations — <unk> considerations , as it appears to me . ” Miss Volumnia rising with a look <unk> , Sir Leicester politely <unk> the grand <unk> of the drawing-room , brings one , and lights it at my Lady ’ s shaded lamp .
“ I must beg you , my Lady , ” he says while doing so , “ to remain a few moments , for this individual of whom I speak arrived this evening shortly before dinner and requested in a very becoming note ” — Sir Leicester , with his habitual regard to truth , <unk> upon it — “ I am bound to say , in a very becoming and <unk> note , the favour of a short interview with yourself and <unk> on the subject of this young girl .
As it appeared that he wished to depart to-night , I replied that we would see him before retiring . ” Miss Volumnia with a third little scream takes flight , <unk> her <unk> — O <unk> ! — well rid of the — what is it ? — ironmaster !
The other cousins soon <unk> , to the last cousin there .
Sir Leicester rings the bell , “ Make my compliments to Mr. Rouncewell , in the housekeeper ’ s <unk> , and say I can receive him now . ” My Lady , who has heard all this with slight attention outwardly , looks towards Mr. Rouncewell as he comes in .
He is a little over fifty perhaps , of a good figure , like his mother , and has a clear voice , a broad forehead from which his dark hair has retired , and a shrewd though open face .
He is a <unk> gentleman dressed in black , <unk> enough , but strong and active .
Has a perfectly natural and easy air and is not in the least embarrassed by the great presence into which he comes .
“ Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , as I have already <unk> for <unk> on you , I cannot do better than be very brief .
I thank you , Sir Leicester . ” The head of the Dedlocks has <unk> towards a sofa between himself and my Lady .
Mr. Rouncewell quietly takes his seat there .
“ In these busy times , when so many great <unk> are in progress , people like myself have so many <unk> in so many places that we are always on the flight . ” Sir Leicester is content enough that the ironmaster should feel that there is no hurry there ; there , in that ancient house , rooted in that quiet park , where the ivy and the moss have had time to <unk> , and the <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> stand deep in the fern and leaves of a hundred years ; and where the <unk> on the terrace has <unk> <unk> for centuries that time which was as much the property of every Dedlock — while he lasted — as the house and <unk> .
Sir Leicester sits down in an easy-chair , <unk> his repose and that of Chesney Wold to the restless <unk> of <unk> .
“ Lady Dedlock has been so kind , ” proceeds Mr. Rouncewell with a <unk> glance and a bow that way , “ as to place near her a young beauty of the name of Rosa .
Now , my son has fallen in love with Rosa and has asked my consent to his proposing marriage to her and to their becoming engaged if she will take him — which I suppose she will .
I have never seen Rosa until to-day , but I have some confidence in my son ’ s good sense — even in love .
I find her what he <unk> her , to the best of my judgment ; and my mother speaks of her with great <unk> . ” “ She in all respects <unk> it , ” says my Lady .
“ I am happy , Lady Dedlock , that you say so , and I need not <unk> on the value to me of your kind opinion of her . ” “ That , ” observes Sir Leicester with unspeakable grandeur , for he thinks the ironmaster a little too <unk> , “ must be quite unnecessary . ” “ Quite unnecessary , Sir Leicester .
Now , my son is a very young man , and Rosa is a very young woman .
As I made my way , so my son must make his ; and his being married at present is out of the question .
But supposing I gave my consent to his engaging himself to this pretty girl , if this pretty girl will engage herself to him , I think it a piece of candour to say at once — I am sure , Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , you will understand and excuse me — I should make it a condition that she did not remain at Chesney Wold .
Therefore , before communicating further with my son , I take the liberty of saying that if her removal would be in any way inconvenient or <unk> , I will hold the matter over with him for any reasonable time and leave it <unk> where it is . ” Not remain at Chesney Wold !
Make it a condition !
All Sir Leicester ’ s old <unk> relative to Wat Tyler and the people in the iron <unk> who do nothing but turn out by <unk> come in a shower upon his head , the fine grey hair of which , as well as of his whiskers , actually stirs with indignation .
“ Am I to understand , sir , ” says Sir Leicester , “ and is my Lady to understand ” — he brings her in thus <unk> , first as a point of gallantry , and next as a point of <unk> , having great reliance on her sense — “ am I to understand , Mr. Rouncewell , and is my Lady to understand , sir , that you consider this young woman too good for Chesney Wold or likely to be injured by remaining here ? ” “ Certainly not , Sir Leicester , ” “ I am glad to hear it . ” Sir Leicester very lofty indeed .
“ Pray , Mr. Rouncewell , ” says my Lady , warning Sir Leicester off with the <unk> gesture of her pretty hand , as if he were a fly , “ explain to me what you mean . ” “ <unk> , Lady Dedlock .
There is nothing I could desire more . ” <unk> her composed face , whose intelligence , however , is too quick and active to be <unk> by any <unk> <unk> , however habitual , to the strong <unk> face of the visitor , a picture of resolution and perseverance , my Lady listens with attention , occasionally slightly bending her head .
“ I am the son of your housekeeper , Lady Dedlock , and passed my childhood about this house .
My mother has lived here half a century and will die here I have no doubt .
She is one of those <unk> — perhaps as good a one as there is — of love , and attachment , and fidelity in such a <unk> , which England may well be proud of , but of which no order can <unk> the whole pride or the whole merit , because such an instance <unk> high worth on two sides — on the great side assuredly , on the small one no less assuredly . ” Sir Leicester <unk> a little to hear the law laid down in this way , but in his honour and his love of truth , he freely , though silently , admits the justice of the ironmaster ’ s <unk> .
“ Pardon me for saying what is so <unk> , but I wouldn ’ t have it hastily supposed , ” with the least turn of his eyes towards Sir Leicester , “ that I am ashamed of my mother ’ s position here , or wanting in all just respect for Chesney Wold and the family .
I certainly may have desired — I certainly have desired , Lady Dedlock — that my mother should retire after so many years and end her days with me .
But as I have found that to <unk> this strong bond would be to break her heart , I have long abandoned that idea . ” Sir Leicester very magnificent again at the <unk> of Mrs. Rouncewell being <unk> off from her natural home to end her days with an ironmaster .
“ I have been , ” proceeds the visitor in a modest , clear way , “ an <unk> and a workman .
I have lived on workman ’ s <unk> , years and years , and beyond a certain point have had to <unk> myself .
My wife was a <unk> ’ s daughter , and plainly brought up .
We have three daughters besides this son of whom I have spoken , and being <unk> able to give them greater advantages than we have had ourselves , we have educated them well , very well .
It has been one of our great cares and <unk> to make them worthy of any station . ” A little <unk> in his fatherly tone here , as if he added in his heart , “ even of the Chesney Wold station . ” Not a little more <unk> , therefore , on the part of Sir Leicester .
“ All this is so frequent , Lady Dedlock , where I live , and among the class to which I belong , that what would be generally called <unk> <unk> are not of such rare occurrence with us as elsewhere .
A son will sometimes make it known to his father that he has fallen in love , say , with a young woman in the factory .
The father , who once worked in a factory himself , will be a little disappointed at first very possibly .
It may be that he had other views for his son .
However , the chances are that having <unk> the young woman to be of <unk> character , he will say to his son , ‘ I must be quite sure you are in earnest here .
This is a serious matter for both of you .
Therefore I shall have this girl educated for two years , ’ or it may be , ‘ I shall place this girl at the same school with your sisters for such a time , during which you will give me your word and honour to see her only so often .
If at the <unk> of that time , when she has so far <unk> by her advantages as that you may be upon a fair <unk> , you are both in the same mind , I will do my part to make you happy . ’ I know of several cases such as I describe , my Lady , and I think they <unk> to me my own course now . ” Sir Leicester ’ s <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , but <unk> .
“ Mr.
Rouncewell , ” says Sir Leicester with his right hand in the breast of his blue coat , the attitude of state in which he is painted in the gallery , “ do you draw a <unk> between Chesney Wold and a — ” Here he <unk> a disposition to <unk> , “ a factory ? ” “ I need not reply , Sir Leicester , that the two places are very different ; but for the purposes of this case , I think a <unk> may be justly drawn between them . ” Sir Leicester directs his majestic glance down one side of the long drawing-room and up the other before he can believe that he is awake .
“ Are you aware , sir , that this young woman whom my Lady — my Lady — has placed near her person was brought up at the village school outside the <unk> ? ” “ Sir Leicester , I am quite aware of it .
A very good school it is , and handsomely supported by this family . ” “ Then , Mr. Rouncewell , ” returns Sir Leicester , “ the application of what you have said is , to me , <unk> . ” “ Will it be more <unk> , Sir Leicester , if I say , ” the ironmaster is reddening a little , “ that I do not regard the village school as teaching everything desirable to be known by my son ’ s wife ? ” From the village school of Chesney Wold , <unk> as it is this minute , to the whole framework of society ; from the whole framework of society , to the aforesaid framework receiving tremendous <unk> in consequence of people ( <unk> , <unk> , and what not ) not minding their <unk> , and getting out of the station unto which they are called — <unk> and for ever , according to Sir Leicester ’ s rapid <unk> , the first station in which they happen to find themselves ; and from that , to their <unk> other people out of THEIR <unk> , and so <unk> the <unk> , and opening the floodgates , and all the rest of it ; this is the <unk> progress of the Dedlock mind .
“ My Lady , I beg your pardon .
<unk> me , for one moment ! ” She has given a faint indication of <unk> to speak .
“ Mr.
Rouncewell , our views of duty , and our views of station , and our views of education , and our views of — in short , <unk> our views — are so <unk> <unk> , that to <unk> this <unk> must be <unk> to your feelings and <unk> to my own .
This young woman is honoured with my Lady ’ s notice and favour .
If she wishes to withdraw herself from that notice and favour or if she <unk> to place herself under the influence of any one who may in his peculiar opinions — you will allow me to say , in his peculiar opinions , though I readily admit that he is not <unk> for them to me — who may , in his peculiar opinions , withdraw her from that notice and favour , she is at any time at liberty to do so .
We are obliged to you for the <unk> with which you have spoken .
It will have no effect of itself , one way or other , on the young woman ’ s position here .
<unk> this , we can make no terms ; and here we beg — if you will be so good — to leave the subject . ” The visitor pauses a moment to give my Lady an opportunity , but she says nothing .
He then rises and replies , “ Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , allow me to thank you for your attention and only to observe that I shall very seriously recommend my son to conquer his present <unk> .
Good night ! ” “ Mr.
Rouncewell , ” says Sir Leicester with all the nature of a gentleman shining in him , “ it is late , and the roads are dark .
I hope your time is not so precious but that you will allow my Lady and myself to offer you the <unk> of Chesney Wold , for to-night at least . ” “ I hope so , ” adds my Lady .
“ I am much obliged to you , but I have to travel all night in order to reach a distant part of the country <unk> at an appointed time in the morning . ” <unk> the ironmaster takes his departure , Sir Leicester ringing the bell and my Lady rising as he leaves the room .
When my Lady goes to her <unk> , she sits down thoughtfully by the fire , and <unk> to the Ghost ’ s Walk , looks at Rosa , writing in an inner room .
Presently my Lady calls her .
“ Come to me , child .
Tell me the truth .
Are you in love ? ” “ Oh !
My Lady ! ” My Lady , looking at the <unk> and blushing face , says smiling , “ Who is it ?
Is it Mrs. Rouncewell ’ s grandson ? ” “ Yes , if you please , my Lady .
But I don ’ t know that I am in love with him — yet . ” “ Yet , you silly little thing !
Do you know that he loves YOU , yet ? ” “ I think he likes me a little , my Lady . ” And Rosa <unk> into tears .
Is this Lady Dedlock standing beside the village beauty , smoothing her dark hair with that motherly touch , and watching her with eyes so full of musing interest ?
Aye , indeed it is !
“ Listen to me , child .
You are young and true , and I believe you are attached to me . ” “ Indeed I am , my Lady .
Indeed there is nothing in the world I wouldn ’ t do to show how much . ” “ And I don ’ t think you would wish to leave me just yet , Rosa , even for a lover ? ” “ No , my Lady !
Oh , no ! ” Rosa looks up for the first time , quite frightened at the thought .
“ <unk> in me , my child .
Don ’ t fear me .
I wish you to be happy , and will make you so — if I can make anybody happy on this earth . ” Rosa , with fresh tears , <unk> at her feet and kisses her hand .
My Lady takes the hand with which she has caught it , and standing with her eyes fixed on the fire , puts it about and about between her own two hands , and gradually lets it fall .
<unk> her so absorbed , Rosa softly withdraws ; but still my Lady ’ s eyes are on the fire .
In search of what ?
Of any hand that is no more , of any hand that never was , of any touch that might have <unk> changed her life ?
Or does she listen to the Ghost ’ s Walk and think what step does it most <unk> ?
A man ’ s ?
A woman ’ s ?
The <unk> of a little child ’ s feet , ever coming on — on — on ?
Some melancholy influence is upon her , or why should so proud a lady close the doors and sit alone upon the hearth so desolate ?
Volumnia is away next day , and all the cousins are scattered before dinner .
Not a cousin of the <unk> but is amazed to hear from Sir Leicester at <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , and opening of floodgates , and <unk> of the framework of society , <unk> through Mrs. Rouncewell ’ s son .
Not a cousin of the <unk> but is really indignant , and <unk> it with the <unk> of William Buffy when in office , and really does feel <unk> of a stake in the country — or the <unk> list — or something — by <unk> and wrong .
As to Volumnia , she is handed down the great staircase by Sir Leicester , as eloquent upon the theme as if there were a general rising in the north of England to obtain her <unk> and pearl necklace .
And thus , with a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> — for it is one <unk> of their <unk> that however difficult they may find it to keep themselves , they MUST keep <unk> and <unk> — the cousins <unk> to the four winds of heaven ; and the one wintry wind that blows to-day shakes a shower from the trees near the deserted house , as if all the cousins had been changed into leaves .
CHAPTER <unk> The Young <unk> Chesney Wold is shut up , <unk> are rolled into great <unk> in corners of <unk> rooms , bright <unk> does <unk> in brown <unk> , <unk> and <unk> puts on <unk> , and the Dedlock <unk> retire from the light of day again .
<unk> and around the house the leaves fall thick , but never fast , for they come <unk> down with a dead <unk> that is <unk> and slow .
Let the gardener sweep and sweep the turf as he will , and press the leaves into full <unk> , and wheel them off , still they lie <unk> .
<unk> the shrill wind round Chesney Wold ; the sharp rain beats , the windows rattle , and the chimneys <unk> .
<unk> hide in the <unk> , veil the points of view , and move in <unk> across the rising grounds .
On all the house there is a cold , blank smell like the smell of a little church , though something <unk> , <unk> that the dead and buried Dedlocks walk there in the long nights and leave the flavour of their graves behind them .
But the house in town , which is rarely in the same mind as Chesney Wold at the same time , seldom <unk> when it <unk> or mourning when it <unk> , excepting when a Dedlock dies — the house in town shines out awakened .
As warm and bright as so much state may be , as delicately <unk> of pleasant <unk> that bear no trace of winter as <unk> flowers can make it , soft and hushed so that the <unk> of the clocks and the <unk> burning of the fires alone disturb the stillness in the rooms , it seems to <unk> those chilled bones of Sir Leicester ’ s in <unk> <unk> .
And Sir Leicester is glad to repose in dignified <unk> before the great fire in the library , <unk> <unk> the backs of his books or honouring the fine arts with a glance of <unk> .
For he has his pictures , ancient and <unk> .
Some of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in which art occasionally <unk> to become a master , which would be best <unk> like the <unk> articles in a <unk> .
As “ Three <unk> chairs , a table and cover , <unk> bottle ( containing wine ) , one <unk> , one <unk> female ’ s <unk> , <unk> face portrait of Miss <unk> the model , and a suit of <unk> containing Don <unk> . ” Or “ One stone terrace ( cracked ) , one <unk> in distance , one <unk> <unk> ’ s dress complete , <unk> <unk> white <unk> <unk> with <unk> portrait of Miss <unk> the model , one <unk> <unk> <unk> in gold with <unk> handle , <unk> <unk> dress ( very rare ) , and <unk> . ” Mr. Tulkinghorn comes and goes pretty often , there being estate business to do , <unk> to be renewed , and so on .
He sees my Lady pretty often , too ; and he and she are as composed , and as indifferent , and take as little <unk> of one another , as ever .
Yet it may be that my Lady fears this Mr. Tulkinghorn and that he knows it .
It may be that he pursues her <unk> and steadily , with no touch of <unk> , remorse , or pity .
It may be that her beauty and all the state and <unk> <unk> her only gives him the greater <unk> for what he is set upon and makes him the more inflexible in it .
Whether he be cold and cruel , whether immovable in what he has made his duty , whether absorbed in love of power , whether determined to have nothing hidden from him in ground where he has <unk> among secrets all his life , whether he in his heart <unk> the splendour of which he is a distant <unk> , whether he is always <unk> up <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of his <unk> clients — whether he be any of this , or all of this , it may be that my Lady had better have five thousand <unk> of fashionable eyes upon her , in distrustful <unk> , than the two eyes of this rusty lawyer with his <unk> of <unk> and his dull black <unk> tied with <unk> at the knees .
Sir Leicester sits in my Lady ’ s room — that room in which Mr. Tulkinghorn read the affidavit in Jarndyce and Jarndyce — particularly complacent .
My Lady , as on that day , sits before the fire with her screen in her hand .
Sir Leicester is particularly complacent because he has found in his newspaper some congenial remarks bearing directly on the floodgates and the framework of society .
They apply so happily to the late case that Sir Leicester has come from the library to my Lady ’ s room expressly to read them aloud .
“ The man who wrote this article , ” he observes by way of <unk> , nodding at the fire as if he were nodding down at the man from a mount , “ has a <unk> mind . ” The man ’ s mind is not so well <unk> but that he <unk> my Lady , who , after a languid effort to listen , or rather a languid resignation of herself to a show of listening , becomes <unk> and falls into a contemplation of the fire as if it were her fire at Chesney Wold , and she had never left it .
Sir Leicester , quite unconscious , reads on through his double eye-glass , occasionally stopping to remove his glass and express approval , as “ Very true indeed , ” “ Very <unk> put , ” “ I have frequently made the same remark myself , ” invariably losing his place after each observation , and going up and down the <unk> to find it again .
Sir Leicester is reading with infinite gravity and state when the door opens , and the Mercury in powder makes this strange announcement , “ The young man , my Lady , of the name of Guppy . ” Sir Leicester pauses , stares , repeats in a <unk> voice , “ The young man of the name of Guppy ? ” <unk> round , he beholds the young man of the name of Guppy , much <unk> and not <unk> a very impressive letter of introduction in his manner and appearance .
“ Pray , ” says Sir Leicester to Mercury , “ what do you mean by announcing with this <unk> a young man of the name of Guppy ? ” “ I beg your pardon , Sir Leicester , but my Lady said she would see the young man whenever he called .
I was not aware that you were here , Sir Leicester . ” With this apology , Mercury directs a <unk> and indignant look at the young man of the name of Guppy which plainly says , “ What do you come calling here for and getting ME into a row ? ” “ It ’ s quite right .
I gave him those directions , ” says my Lady .
“ Let the young man wait . ” “ By no means , my Lady .
Since he has your orders to come , I will not <unk> you . ” Sir Leicester in his gallantry retires , rather <unk> to accept a bow from the young man as he goes out and majestically supposing him to be some <unk> of <unk> appearance .
Lady Dedlock looks <unk> at her visitor when the servant has left the room , casting her eyes over him from head to foot .
She <unk> him to stand by the door and asks him what he wants .
“ That your ladyship would have the kindness to oblige me with a little conversation , ” returns Mr. Guppy , embarrassed .
“ You are , of course , the person who has written me so many letters ? ” “ Several , your ladyship .
Several before your ladyship <unk> to favour me with an answer . ” “ And could you not take the same means of rendering a Conversation unnecessary ?
Can you not still ? ” Mr. Guppy <unk> his mouth into a silent “ No ! ” and shakes his head .
“ You have been strangely <unk> .
If it should appear , after all , that what you have to say does not concern me — and I don ’ t know how it can , and don ’ t expect that it will — you will allow me to cut you short with but little ceremony .
Say what you have to say , if you please . ” My Lady , with a careless <unk> of her screen , turns herself towards the fire again , sitting almost with her back to the young man of the name of Guppy .
“ With your ladyship ’ s permission , then , ” says the young man , “ I will now enter on my business .
Hem !
I am , as I told your ladyship in my first letter , in the law .
Being in the law , I have learnt the habit of not <unk> myself in writing , and therefore I did not mention to your ladyship the name of the firm with which I am connected and in which my standing — and I may add income — is tolerably good .
I may now state to your ladyship , in confidence , that the name of that firm is Kenge and Carboy , of Lincoln ’ s Inn , which may not be altogether unknown to your ladyship in connexion with the case in Chancery of Jarndyce and Jarndyce . ” My Lady ’ s figure begins to be expressive of some attention .
She has ceased to <unk> the screen and holds it as if she were listening .
“ Now , I may say to your ladyship at once , ” says Mr. Guppy , a little <unk> , “ it is no matter arising out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce that made me so desirous to speak to your ladyship , which conduct I have no doubt did appear , and does appear , <unk> — in fact , almost <unk> . ” After waiting for a moment to receive some assurance to the contrary , and not receiving any , Mr. Guppy proceeds , “ If it had been Jarndyce and Jarndyce , I should have gone at once to your ladyship ’ s solicitor , Mr. Tulkinghorn , of the Fields .
I have the pleasure of being acquainted with Mr. Tulkinghorn — at least we move when we meet one another — and if it had been any business of that sort , I should have gone to him . ” My Lady turns a little round and says , “ You had better sit down . ” “ Thank your ladyship . ” Mr. Guppy does so .
“ Now , your ladyship ” — Mr.
Guppy refers to a little slip of paper on which he has made small notes of his line of argument and which seems to involve him in the <unk> <unk> whenever he looks at it — “ I — Oh , yes ! — I place myself entirely in your ladyship ’ s hands .
If your ladyship was to make any complaint to Kenge and Carboy or to Mr. Tulkinghorn of the present visit , I should be placed in a very disagreeable situation .
That , I openly admit .
Consequently , I rely upon your ladyship ’ s honour . ” My Lady , with a disdainful gesture of the hand that holds the screen , <unk> him of his being worth no complaint from her .
“ Thank your ladyship , ” says Mr. Guppy ; “ quite satisfactory .
Now — I — <unk> it ! — The fact is that I put down a head or two here of the order of the points I thought of touching upon , and they ’ re written short , and I can ’ t quite make out what they mean .
If your ladyship will excuse me taking it to the window half a moment , I — ” Mr. Guppy , going to the window , <unk> into a pair of <unk> , to whom he says in his confusion , “ I beg your pardon , I am sure . ” This does not <unk> to the greater <unk> of his notes .
He murmurs , growing warm and red and holding the slip of paper now close to his eyes , now a long way off , “ <unk>
What ’ s <unk>
for ?
Oh !
<unk> !
Oh , I know !
Yes , to be sure ! ” And comes back <unk> .
“ I am not aware , ” says Mr. Guppy , standing <unk> between my Lady and his chair , “ whether your ladyship ever happened to hear of , or to see , a young lady of the name of Miss Esther Summerson . ” My Lady ’ s eyes look at him full .
“ I saw a young lady of that name not long ago .
This past autumn . ” “ Now , did it strike your ladyship that she was like anybody ? ” asks Mr. Guppy , crossing his arms , holding his head on one side , and <unk> the corner of his mouth with his <unk> .
My Lady <unk> her eyes from him no more .
“ No . ” “ Not like your ladyship ’ s family ? ” “ No . ” “ I think your ladyship , ” says Mr. Guppy , “ can hardly remember Miss Summerson ’ s face ? ” “ I remember the young lady very well .
What has this to do with me ? ” “ Your ladyship , I do assure you that having Miss Summerson ’ s image imprinted on my ’ eart — which I mention in confidence — I found , when I had the honour of going over your ladyship ’ s mansion of Chesney Wold while on a short out in the county of Lincolnshire with a friend , such a <unk> between Miss Esther Summerson and your ladyship ’ s own portrait that it completely knocked me over , so much so that I didn ’ t at the moment even know what it WAS that knocked me over .
And now I have the honour of <unk> your ladyship near ( I have often , since that , taken the liberty of looking at your ladyship in your carriage in the park , when I dare say you was not aware of me , but I never saw your ladyship so near ) , it ’ s really more surprising than I thought it . ” Young man of the name of Guppy !
There have been times , when ladies lived in <unk> and had <unk> <unk> within call , when that poor life of yours would NOT have been worth a minute ’ s <unk> , with those beautiful eyes looking at you as they look at this moment .
My Lady , slowly using her little <unk> as a <unk> , asks him again what he supposes that his taste for <unk> has to do with her .
“ Your ladyship , ” replies Mr. Guppy , again referring to his paper , “ I am coming to that .
<unk> these notes !
Oh !
‘ Mrs.
Chadband . ’ Yes . ” Mr. Guppy draws his chair a little forward and seats himself again .
My Lady <unk> in her chair composedly , though with a trifle less of graceful ease than usual perhaps , and never falters in her steady gaze .
“ A — stop a minute , though ! ” Mr. Guppy refers again .
“ <unk>
twice ?
Oh , yes !
Yes , I see my way now , right on . ” <unk> up the slip of paper as an instrument to point his speech with , Mr. Guppy proceeds .
“ Your ladyship , there is a mystery about Miss Esther Summerson ’ s birth and bringing up .
I am informed of that fact because — which I mention in confidence — I know it in the way of my profession at Kenge and Carboy ’ s .
Now , as I have already mentioned to your ladyship , Miss Summerson ’ s image is imprinted on my ’ eart .
If I could clear this mystery for her , or prove her to be well related , or find that having the honour to be a remote <unk> of your ladyship ’ s family she had a right to be made a party in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , why , I might make a sort of a claim upon Miss Summerson to look with an eye of more <unk> favour on my proposals than she has exactly done as yet .
In fact , as yet she hasn ’ t favoured them at all . ” A kind of angry smile just <unk> upon my Lady ’ s face .
“ Now , it ’ s a very singular circumstance , your ladyship , ” says Mr. Guppy , “ though one of those circumstances that do fall in the way of us professional men — which I may call myself , for though not admitted , yet I have had a present of my articles made to me by Kenge and Carboy , on my mother ’ s advancing from the principal of her little income the money for the stamp , which comes heavy — that I have <unk> the person who lived as servant with the lady who brought Miss Summerson up before Mr. Jarndyce took charge of her .
That lady was a Miss Barbary , your ladyship . ” Is the dead colour on my Lady ’ s face reflected from the screen which has a green silk ground and which she holds in her raised hand as if she had forgotten it , or is it a dreadful <unk> that has fallen on her ?
“ Did your ladyship , ” says Mr. Guppy , “ ever happen to hear of Miss Barbary ? ” “ I don ’ t know .
I think so .
Yes . ” “ Was Miss Barbary at all connected with your ladyship ’ s family ? ” My Lady ’ s lips move , but they utter nothing .
She shakes her head .
“ NOT connected ? ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ Oh !
Not to your ladyship ’ s knowledge , perhaps ?
Ah !
But might be ?
Yes . ” After each of these <unk> , she has inclined her head .
“ Very good !
Now , this Miss Barbary was extremely close — seems to have been <unk> close for a female , <unk> being generally ( in common life at least ) rather given to conversation — and my witness never had an idea whether she possessed a single relative .
On one occasion , and only one , she seems to have been confidential to my witness on a single point , and she then told her that the little girl ’ s real name was not Esther Summerson , but Esther Hawdon . ” “ My God ! ” Mr. Guppy stares .
Lady Dedlock sits before him looking him through , with the same dark shade upon her face , in the same attitude even to the holding of the screen , with her lips a little apart , her brow a little contracted , but for the moment dead .
He sees her consciousness return , sees a <unk> pass across her <unk> like a <unk> over water , sees her lips shake , sees her <unk> them by a great effort , sees her force herself back to the knowledge of his presence and of what he has said .
All this , so quickly , that her exclamation and her dead condition seem to have passed away like the features of those <unk> dead bodies sometimes opened up in <unk> , which , struck by the air like lightning , <unk> in a breath .
“ Your ladyship is acquainted with the name of Hawdon ? ” “ I have heard it before . ” “ Name of any <unk> or remote <unk> of your ladyship ’ s family ? ” “ No . ” “ Now , your ladyship , ” says Mr. Guppy , “ I come to the last point of the case , so far as I have got it up .
It ’ s going on , and I shall <unk> it up closer and closer as it goes on .
Your ladyship must know — if your ladyship don ’ t happen , by any chance , to know already — that there was found dead at the house of a person named Krook , near Chancery Lane , some time ago , a law-writer in great distress .
Upon which law-writer there was an inquest , and which law-writer was an <unk> character , his name being unknown .
But , your ladyship , I have discovered very lately that that law-writer ’ s name was Hawdon . ” “ And what is THAT to me ? ” “ Aye , your ladyship , that ’ s the question !
Now , your ladyship , a queer thing happened after that man ’ s death .
A lady started up , a <unk> lady , your ladyship , who went to look at the scene of action and went to look at his grave .
She <unk> a <unk> boy to show it her .
If your ladyship would wish to have the boy produced in <unk> of this <unk> , I can lay my hand upon him at any time . ” The wretched boy is nothing to my Lady , and she does NOT wish to have him produced .
“ Oh , I assure your ladyship it ’ s a very queer start indeed , ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ If you was to hear him tell about the rings that <unk> on her fingers when she took her glove off , you ’ d think it quite romantic . ” There are <unk> glittering on the hand that holds the screen .
My Lady <unk> with the screen and makes them <unk> more , again with that expression which in other times might have been so dangerous to the young man of the name of Guppy .
“ It was supposed , your ladyship , that he left no rag or scrap behind him by which he could be possibly <unk> .
But he did .
He left a bundle of old letters . ” The screen still goes , as before .
All this time her eyes never once release him .
“ They were taken and <unk> .
And to-morrow night , your ladyship , they will come into my possession . ” “ Still I ask you , what is this to me ? ” “ Your ladyship , I conclude with that . ” Mr. Guppy rises .
“ If you think there ’ s enough in this chain of circumstances put together — in the <unk> strong likeness of this young lady to your ladyship , which is a positive fact for a jury ; in her having been brought up by Miss Barbary ; in Miss Barbary stating Miss Summerson ’ s real name to be Hawdon ; in your ladyship ’ s knowing both these names <unk> <unk> ; and in Hawdon ’ s dying as he did — to give your ladyship a family interest in going further into the case , I will bring these papers here .
I don ’ t know what they are , except that they are old letters : I have never had them in my possession yet .
I will bring those papers here as soon as I get them and go over them for the first time with your ladyship .
I have told your ladyship my object .
I have told your ladyship that I should be placed in a very disagreeable situation if any complaint was made , and all is in strict confidence . ” Is this the full purpose of the young man of the name of Guppy , or has he any other ?
Do his words <unk> the length , breadth , <unk> , of his object and suspicion in coming here ; or if not , what do they hide ?
He is a <unk> for my Lady there .
She may look at him , but he can look at the table and keep that <unk> face of his from telling anything .
“ You may bring the letters , ” says my Lady , “ if you choose . ” “ Your ladyship is not very encouraging , upon my word and honour , ” says Mr. Guppy , a little injured .
“ You may bring the letters , ” she repeats in the same tone , “ if you — please . ” “ It shall be done .
I wish your ladyship good day . ” On a table near her is a rich <unk> of a <unk> , <unk> and clasped like an old <unk> .
She , looking at him still , takes it to her and unlocks it .
“ Oh !
I assure your ladyship I am not <unk> by any motives of that sort , ” says Mr. Guppy , “ and I couldn ’ t accept anything of the kind .
I wish your ladyship good day , and am much obliged to you all the same . ” So the young man makes his bow and goes downstairs , where the <unk> Mercury does not consider himself called upon to leave his <unk> by the <unk> to let the young man out .
As Sir Leicester <unk> in his library and <unk> over his newspaper , is there no influence in the house to <unk> him , not to say to make the very trees at Chesney Wold <unk> up their <unk> arms , the very portraits frown , the very <unk> stir ?
No .
<unk> , <unk> , and cries are but air , and air is so shut in and shut out throughout the house in town that sounds need be uttered <unk> indeed by my Lady in her chamber to carry any faint <unk> to Sir Leicester ’ s ears ; and yet this cry is in the house , going upward from a wild figure on its knees .
“ O my child , my child !
Not dead in the first hours of her life , as my cruel sister told me , but sternly <unk> by her , after she had <unk> me and my name !
O my child , O my child ! ” CHAPTER <unk> Esther ’ s Narrative Richard had been gone away some time when a visitor came to pass a few days with us .
It was an <unk> lady .
It was Mrs. Woodcourt , who , having come from <unk> to stay with Mrs. Bayham Badger and having written to my guardian , “ by her son Allan ’ s desire , ” to report that she had heard from him and that he was well “ and sent his kind remembrances to all of us , ” had been invited by my guardian to make a visit to Bleak House .
She stayed with us nearly three weeks .
She took very kindly to me and was extremely confidential , so much so that sometimes she almost made me uncomfortable .
I had no right , I knew very well , to be uncomfortable because she confided in me , and I felt it was unreasonable ; still , with all I could do , I could not quite help it .
She was such a sharp little lady and used to sit with her hands folded in each other looking so very watchful while she talked to me that perhaps I found that rather <unk> .
Or perhaps it was her being so upright and <unk> , though I don ’ t think it was that , because I thought that <unk> pleasant .
Nor can it have been the general expression of her face , which was very sparkling and pretty for an old lady .
I don ’ t know what it was .
Or at least if I do now , I thought I did not then .
Or at least — but it don ’ t matter .
Of a night when I was going upstairs to bed , she would <unk> me into her room , where she sat before the fire in a great chair ; and , dear me , she would tell me about Morgan ap-Kerrig until I was quite low-spirited !
Sometimes she <unk> a few verses from <unk> and the <unk> ( if those are the right names , which I dare say they are not ) , and would become quite fiery with the sentiments they expressed .
Though I never knew what they were ( being in <unk> ) , further than that they were highly <unk> of the <unk> of Morgan ap-Kerrig .
“ So , Miss Summerson , ” she would say to me with stately triumph , “ this , you see , is the fortune inherited by my son .
<unk> my son goes , he can claim <unk> with <unk> .
He may not have money , but he always has what is much better — family , my dear . ” I had my doubts of their <unk> so very much for Morgan ap-Kerrig in India and China , but of course I never expressed them .
I used to say it was a great thing to be so highly connected .
“ It IS , my dear , a great thing , ” Mrs. Woodcourt would reply .
“ It has its <unk> ; my son ’ s choice of a wife , for instance , is limited by it , but the <unk> choice of the <unk> family is limited in much the same manner . ” Then she would <unk> me on the arm and smooth my dress , as much as to assure me that she had a good opinion of me , the distance between us notwithstanding .
“ Poor Mr. Woodcourt , my dear , ” she would say , and always with some emotion , for with her lofty <unk> she had a very affectionate heart , “ was <unk> from a great <unk> family , the <unk> of <unk> .
He served his king and country as an officer in the Royal <unk> , and he died on the field .
My son is one of the last <unk> of two old families .
With the blessing of heaven he will set them up again and <unk> them with another old family . ” It was in vain for me to try to change the subject , as I used to try , only for the sake of novelty or perhaps because — but I need not be so particular .
Mrs. Woodcourt never would let me change it .
“ My dear , ” she said one night , “ you have so much sense and you look at the world in a quiet manner so superior to your time of life that it is a comfort to me to talk to you about these family matters of mine .
You don ’ t know much of my son , my dear ; but you know enough of him , I dare say , to recollect him ? ” “ Yes , ma ’ am .
I recollect him . ” “ Yes , my dear .
Now , my dear , I think you are a judge of character , and I should like to have your opinion of him . ” “ Oh , Mrs. Woodcourt , ” said I , “ that is so difficult ! ” “ Why is it so difficult , my dear ? ” she returned .
“ I don ’ t see it myself . ” “ To give an opinion — ” “ On so slight an acquaintance , my dear .
THAT ’ S true . ” I didn ’ t mean that , because Mr. Woodcourt had been at our house a good deal altogether and had become quite <unk> with my guardian .
I said so , and added that he seemed to be very clever in his profession — we thought — and that his kindness and gentleness to Miss Flite were above all praise .
“ You do him justice ! ” said Mrs. Woodcourt , pressing my hand .
“ You <unk> him exactly .
Allan is a dear fellow , and in his profession <unk> .
I say it , though I am his mother .
Still , I must confess he is not without faults , love . ” “ None of us are , ” said I.
“ Ah !
But his really are faults that he might correct , and ought to correct , ” returned the sharp old lady , sharply shaking her head .
“ I am so much attached to you that I may confide in you , my dear , as a third party wholly disinterested , that he is <unk> itself . ” I said I should have thought it hardly possible that he could have been otherwise than constant to his profession and zealous in the pursuit of it , judging from the reputation he had <unk> .
“ You are right again , my dear , ” the old lady retorted , “ but I don ’ t refer to his profession , look you . ” “ Oh ! ” said I.
“ No , ” said she .
“ I refer , my dear , to his social conduct .
He is always paying trivial <unk> to young ladies , and always has been , ever since he was eighteen .
Now , my dear , he has never really cared for any one of them and has never meant in doing this to do any harm or to express anything but politeness and good nature .
Still , it ’ s not right , you know ; is it ? ” “ No , ” said I , as she seemed to wait for me .
“ And it might lead to mistaken <unk> , you see , my dear . ” I supposed it might .
“ Therefore , I have told him many times that he really should be more careful , both in justice to himself and in justice to others .
And he has always said , ‘ Mother , I will be ; but you know me better than anybody else does , and you know I mean no harm — in short , mean nothing . ’ All of which is very true , my dear , but is no <unk> .
However , as he is now gone so far away and for an <unk> time , and as he will have good opportunities and <unk> , we may consider this past and gone .
And you , my dear , ” said the old lady , who was now all nods and smiles , “ regarding your dear self , my love ? ” “ Me , Mrs. Woodcourt ? ” “ Not to be always selfish , talking of my son , who has gone to seek his fortune and to find a wife — when do you mean to seek YOUR fortune and to find a husband , Miss Summerson ?
Hey , look you !
Now you <unk> ! ” I don ’ t think I did <unk> — at all events , it was not important if I did — and I said my present fortune perfectly contented me and I had no wish to change it .
“ Shall I tell you what I always think of you and the fortune yet to come for you , my love ? ” said Mrs. Woodcourt .
“ If you believe you are a good <unk> , ” said I.
“ Why , then , it is that you will marry some one very rich and very worthy , much older — five and twenty years , perhaps — than yourself .
And you will be an excellent wife , and much beloved , and very happy . ” “ That is a good fortune , ” said I.
“ But why is it to be mine ? ” “ My dear , ” she returned , “ there ’ s <unk> in it — you are so busy , and so neat , and so <unk> situated altogether that there ’ s <unk> in it , and it will come to pass .
And nobody , my love , will <unk> you more sincerely on such a marriage than I shall . ” It was curious that this should make me uncomfortable , but I think it did .
I know it did .
It made me for some part of that night uncomfortable .
I was so ashamed of my folly that I did not like to confess it even to Ada , and that made me more uncomfortable still .
I would have given anything not to have been so much in the bright old lady ’ s confidence if I could have possibly <unk> it .
It gave me the most <unk> opinions of her .
At one time I thought she was a <unk> , and at another time that she was the <unk> of truth .
Now I suspected that she was very <unk> , next moment I believed her honest <unk> heart to be perfectly innocent and simple .
And after all , what did it matter to me , and why did it matter to me ?
Why could not I , going up to bed with my basket of keys , stop to sit down by her fire and accommodate myself for a little while to her , at least as well as to anybody else , and not trouble myself about the harmless things she said to me ?
<unk> towards her , as I certainly was , for I was very anxious that she should like me and was very glad indeed that she did , why should I <unk> afterwards , with actual distress and pain , on every word she said and <unk> it over and over again in twenty <unk> ?
Why was it so <unk> to me to have her in our house , and confidential to me every night , when I yet felt that it was better and <unk> somehow that she should be there than anywhere else ?
These were <unk> and <unk> that I could not account for .
At least , if I could — but I shall come to all that by and by , and it is mere <unk> to go on about it now .
So when Mrs. Woodcourt went away , I was sorry to lose her but was relieved too .
And then Caddy Jellyby came down , and Caddy brought such a <unk> of domestic news that it gave us <unk> occupation .
First Caddy <unk> ( and would at first declare nothing else ) that I was the best adviser that ever was known .
This , my pet said , was no news at all ; and this , I said , of course , was nonsense .
Then Caddy told us that she was going to be married in a month and that if Ada and I would be her <unk> , she was the happiest girl in the world .
To be sure , this was news indeed ; and I thought we never should have done talking about it , we had so much to say to Caddy , and Caddy had so much to say to us .
It seemed that Caddy ’ s unfortunate papa had got over his <unk> — “ gone through the <unk> , ” was the expression Caddy used , as if it were a <unk> — with the general <unk> and <unk> of his <unk> , and had got rid of his affairs in some blessed manner without <unk> in understanding them , and had given up everything he possessed ( which was not worth much , I should think , to judge from the state of the furniture ) , and had satisfied every one concerned that he could do no more , poor man .
So , he had been <unk> dismissed to “ the office ” to begin the world again .
What he did at the office , I never knew ; Caddy said he was a “ <unk> and general agent , ” and the only thing I ever understood about that business was that when he wanted money more than usual he went to the <unk> to look for it , and hardly ever found it .
As soon as her papa had <unk> his mind by becoming this <unk> lamb , and they had removed to a furnished lodging in <unk> Garden ( where I found the children , when I afterwards went there , cutting the horse hair out of the seats of the chairs and choking themselves with it ) , Caddy had brought about a meeting between him and old Mr. Turveydrop ; and poor Mr. Jellyby , being very humble and meek , had <unk> to Mr. Turveydrop ’ s deportment so <unk> that they had become excellent friends .
By degrees , old Mr. Turveydrop , thus <unk> with the idea of his son ’ s marriage , had worked up his <unk> feelings to the height of contemplating that event as being near at hand and had given his gracious consent to the young couple <unk> housekeeping at the academy in Newman Street when they would .
“ And your papa , Caddy .
What did he say ? ” “ Oh !
Poor Pa , ” said Caddy , “ only cried and said he hoped we might get on better than he and Ma had got on .
He didn ’ t say so before Prince , he only said so to me .
And he said , ‘ My poor girl , you have not been very well taught how to make a home for your husband , but unless you mean with all your heart to <unk> to do it , you had better murder him than marry him — if you really love him . ’ ” “ And how did you <unk> him , Caddy ? ” “ Why , it was very <unk> , you know , to see poor Pa so low and hear him say such terrible things , and I couldn ’ t help crying myself .
But I told him that I <unk> mean it with all my heart and that I hoped our house would be a place for him to come and find some comfort in of an evening and that I hoped and thought I could be a better daughter to him there than at home .
Then I mentioned Peepy ’ s coming to stay with me , and then Pa began to cry again and said the children were Indians . ” “ Indians , Caddy ? ” “ Yes , ” said Caddy , “ wild Indians .
And Pa said ” — here she began to sob , poor girl , not at all like the happiest girl in the world — “ that he was sensible the best thing that could happen to them was their being all <unk> together . ” Ada suggested that it was comfortable to know that Mr. Jellyby did not mean these <unk> sentiments .
“ No , of course I know Pa wouldn ’ t like his family to be <unk> in their blood , ” said Caddy , “ but he means that they are very unfortunate in being Ma ’ s children and that he is very unfortunate in being Ma ’ s husband ; and I am sure that ’ s true , though it seems unnatural to say so . ” I asked Caddy if Mrs. Jellyby knew that her <unk> was fixed .
“ Oh !
You know what Ma is , Esther , ” she returned .
“ It ’ s impossible to say whether she knows it or not .
She has been told it often enough ; and when she IS told it , she only gives me a placid look , as if I was I don ’ t know what — a <unk> in the distance , ” said Caddy with a sudden idea ; “ and then she shakes her head and says ‘ Oh , Caddy , Caddy , what a <unk> you are ! ’ and goes on with the <unk> letters . ” “ And about your <unk> , Caddy ? ” said I.
For she was under no <unk> with us .
“ Well , my dear Esther , ” she returned , drying her eyes , “ I must do the best I can and trust to my dear Prince never to have an <unk> remembrance of my coming so <unk> to him .
If the question concerned an <unk> for <unk> , Ma would know all about it and would be quite excited .
Being what it is , she neither knows nor cares . ” Caddy was not at all deficient in natural affection for her mother , but mentioned this with tears as an <unk> fact , which I am afraid it was .
We were sorry for the poor dear girl and found so much to admire in the good disposition which had <unk> under such <unk> that we both at once ( I mean Ada and I ) proposed a little scheme that made her perfectly joyful .
This was her staying with us for three weeks , my staying with her for one , and our all three <unk> and cutting out , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and doing the very best we could think of to make the most of her stock .
My guardian being as pleased with the idea as Caddy was , we took her home next day to arrange the matter and brought her out again in triumph with her boxes and all the <unk> that could be squeezed out of a <unk> note , which Mr. Jellyby had found in the <unk> I suppose , but which he at all events gave her .
What my guardian would not have given her if we had encouraged him , it would be difficult to say , but we thought it right to compound for no more than her <unk> and bonnet .
He agreed to this compromise , and if Caddy had ever been happy in her life , she was happy when we sat down to work .
She was <unk> enough with her needle , poor girl , and <unk> her fingers as much as she had been used to ink them .
She could not help reddening a little now and then , partly with the <unk> and partly with vexation at being able to do no better , but she soon got over that and began to improve rapidly .
So day after day she , and my darling , and my little maid Charley , and a <unk> out of the town , and I , sat hard at work , as pleasantly as possible .
Over and above this , Caddy was very anxious “ to learn housekeeping , ” as she said .
Now , <unk> upon us !
The idea of her <unk> housekeeping of a person of my vast experience was such a joke that I laughed , and coloured up , and fell into a <unk> confusion when she proposed it .
However , I said , “ Caddy , I am sure you are very welcome to learn anything that you can learn of ME , my dear , ” and I showed her all my books and <unk> and all my <unk> ways .
You would have supposed that I was showing her some wonderful <unk> , by her study of them ; and if you had seen her , whenever I <unk> my housekeeping keys , get up and attend me , certainly you might have thought that there never was a greater <unk> than I with a <unk> <unk> than Caddy Jellyby .
So what with working and housekeeping , and <unk> to Charley , and <unk> in the evening with my guardian , and <unk> with Ada , the three weeks slipped fast away .
Then I went home with Caddy to see what could be done there , and Ada and Charley remained behind to take care of my guardian .
When I say I went home with Caddy , I mean to the furnished lodging in <unk> Garden .
We went to Newman Street two or three times , where preparations were in progress too — a good many , I observed , for <unk> the comforts of old Mr. Turveydrop , and a few for putting the newly married couple away <unk> at the top of the house — but our great point was to make the furnished lodging decent for the <unk> and to <unk> Mrs. Jellyby beforehand with some faint sense of the occasion .
The latter was the more difficult thing of the two because Mrs. Jellyby and an unwholesome boy occupied the front sitting-room ( the back one was a mere <unk> ) , and it was <unk> down with waste-paper and Borrioboolan documents , as an untidy stable might be <unk> with straw .
Mrs. Jellyby sat there all day drinking strong coffee , <unk> , and holding Borrioboolan <unk> by appointment .
The unwholesome boy , who seemed to me to be going into a decline , took his <unk> out of the house .
When Mr. Jellyby came home , he usually <unk> and went down into the kitchen .
There he got something to eat if the servant would give him anything , and then , feeling that he was in the way , went out and walked about <unk> Garden in the wet .
The poor children <unk> up and tumbled down the house as they had always been accustomed to do .
The <unk> of these devoted little <unk> in any <unk> condition being quite out of the question at a week ’ s notice , I proposed to Caddy that we should make them as happy as we could on her marriage morning in the <unk> where they all slept , and should <unk> our greatest efforts to her mama and her mama ’ s room , and a clean breakfast .
In truth Mrs. Jellyby required a good deal of attention , the <unk> up her back having <unk> considerably since I first knew her and her hair looking like the <unk> of a <unk> ’ s horse .
<unk> that the <unk> of Caddy ’ s <unk> would be the best means of approaching the subject , I invited Mrs. Jellyby to come and look at it spread out on Caddy ’ s bed in the evening after the unwholesome boy was gone .
“ My dear Miss Summerson , ” said she , rising from her desk with her usual <unk> of temper , “ these are really ridiculous preparations , though your assisting them is a proof of your kindness .
There is something so <unk> absurd to me in the idea of Caddy being married !
Oh , Caddy , you silly , silly , silly <unk> ! ” She came upstairs with us notwithstanding and looked at the clothes in her <unk> <unk> manner .
They suggested one <unk> idea to her , for she said with her placid smile , and shaking her head , “ My good Miss Summerson , at half the cost , this weak child might have been <unk> for Africa ! ” On our going downstairs again , Mrs. Jellyby asked me whether this troublesome business was really to take place next Wednesday .
And on my replying yes , she said , “ Will my room be required , my dear Miss Summerson ?
For it ’ s quite impossible that I can put my papers away . ” I took the liberty of saying that the room would certainly be wanted and that I thought we must put the papers away somewhere .
“ Well , my dear Miss Summerson , ” said Mrs. Jellyby , “ you know best , I dare say .
But by obliging me to employ a boy , Caddy has embarrassed me to that extent , <unk> as I am with public business , that I don ’ t know which way to turn .
We have a <unk> meeting , too , on Wednesday afternoon , and the inconvenience is very serious . ” “ It is not likely to <unk> again , ” said I , smiling .
“ Caddy will be married but once , probably . ” “ That ’ s true , ” Mrs. Jellyby replied ; “ that ’ s true , my dear .
I suppose we must make the best of it ! ” The next question was how Mrs. Jellyby should be dressed on the occasion .
I thought it very curious to see her looking on serenely from her <unk> while Caddy and I discussed it , occasionally shaking her head at us with a <unk> smile like a superior spirit who could just bear with our trifling .
The state in which her dresses were , and the extraordinary confusion in which she kept them , added not a little to our difficulty ; but at length we <unk> something not very unlike what a <unk> mother might wear on such an occasion .
The <unk> manner in which Mrs. Jellyby would deliver herself up to having this <unk> tried on by the <unk> , and the <unk> with which she would then observe to me how sorry she was that I had not turned my thoughts to Africa , were <unk> with the rest of her behaviour .
The lodging was rather confined as to space , but I fancied that if Mrs. Jellyby ’ s household had been the only <unk> in Saint <unk> ’ s or Saint <unk> ’ s , the sole advantage they would have found in the size of the building would have been its <unk> a great deal of room to be dirty in .
I believe that nothing belonging to the family which it had been possible to break was <unk> at the time of those preparations for Caddy ’ s marriage , that nothing which it had been possible to spoil in any way was <unk> , and that no domestic object which was capable of <unk> dirt , from a dear child ’ s knee to the <unk> , was without as much dirt as could well <unk> upon it .
Poor Mr. Jellyby , who very seldom spoke and almost always sat when he was at home with his head against the wall , became interested when he saw that Caddy and I were <unk> to establish some order among all this waste and ruin and took off his coat to help .
But such wonderful things came tumbling out of the <unk> when they were opened — bits of <unk> <unk> , <unk> bottles , Mrs. Jellyby ’ s <unk> , letters , tea , <unk> , odd boots and shoes of children , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , damp <unk> in odds and ends of paper bags , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , bread , Mrs. Jellyby ’ s bonnets , books with butter sticking to the <unk> , <unk> candle ends put out by being turned <unk> down in broken candlesticks , <unk> , heads and <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , gloves , <unk> , <unk> — that he looked frightened , and left off again .
But he came regularly every evening and sat without his coat , with his head against the wall , as though he would have helped us if he had known how .
“ Poor Pa ! ” said Caddy to me on the night before the great day , when we really had got things a little to rights .
“ It seems <unk> to leave him , Esther .
But what could I do if I stayed !
Since I first knew you , I have <unk> and <unk> over and over again , but it ’ s useless .
Ma and Africa , together , <unk> the whole house directly .
We never have a servant who don ’ t drink .
Ma ’ s <unk> to everything . ” Mr. Jellyby could not hear what she said , but he seemed very low indeed and shed tears , I thought .
“ My heart <unk> for him ; that it does ! ” sobbed Caddy .
“ I can ’ t help thinking to-night , Esther , how dearly I hope to be happy with Prince , and how dearly Pa hoped , I dare say , to be happy with Ma .
What a disappointed life ! ” “ My dear Caddy ! ” said Mr. Jellyby , looking slowly round from the <unk> .
It was the first time , I think , I ever heard him say three words together .
“ Yes , Pa ! ” cried Caddy , going to him and <unk> him affectionately .
“ My dear Caddy , ” said Mr. Jellyby .
“ Never have — ” “ Not Prince , Pa ? ” <unk> Caddy .
“ Not have Prince ? ” “ Yes , my dear , ” said Mr. Jellyby .
“ Have him , certainly .
But , never have — ” I mentioned in my account of our first visit in Thavies Inn that Richard described Mr. Jellyby as frequently opening his mouth after dinner without saying anything .
It was a habit of his .
He opened his mouth now a great many times and shook his head in a melancholy manner .
“ What do you wish me not to have ?
Don ’ t have what , dear Pa ? ” asked Caddy , <unk> him , with her arms round his neck .
“ Never have a mission , my dear child . ” Mr. Jellyby <unk> and laid his head against the wall again , and this was the only time I ever heard him make any approach to expressing his sentiments on the Borrioboolan question .
I suppose he had been more <unk> and lively once , but he seemed to have been completely exhausted long before I knew him .
I thought Mrs. Jellyby never would have left off serenely looking over her papers and drinking coffee that night .
It was twelve o ’ clock before we could obtain possession of the room , and the <unk> it required then was so <unk> that Caddy , who was almost tired out , sat down in the middle of the dust and cried .
But she soon <unk> up , and we did wonders with it before we went to bed .
In the morning it looked , by the aid of a few flowers and a quantity of soap and water and a little arrangement , quite gay .
The plain breakfast made a cheerful show , and Caddy was perfectly charming .
But when my darling came , I thought — and I think now — that I never had seen such a dear face as my beautiful pet ’ s .
We made a little <unk> for the children upstairs , and we put Peepy at the head of the table , and we showed them Caddy in her <unk> dress , and they <unk> their hands and <unk> , and Caddy cried to think that she was going away from them and <unk> them over and over again until we brought Prince up to fetch her away — when , I am sorry to say , Peepy bit him .
Then there was old Mr. Turveydrop downstairs , in a state of deportment not to be expressed , <unk> blessing Caddy and giving my guardian to understand that his son ’ s happiness was his own <unk> work and that he <unk> personal considerations to <unk> it .
“ My dear sir , ” said Mr. Turveydrop , “ these young people will live with me ; my house is large enough for their <unk> , and they shall not want the shelter of my roof .
I could have wished — you will understand the allusion , Mr. Jarndyce , for you remember my illustrious patron the Prince Regent — I could have wished that my son had married into a family where there was more deportment , but the will of heaven be done ! ” Mr. and Mrs. Pardiggle were of the party — Mr.
Pardiggle , an <unk> man with a large waistcoat and <unk> hair , who was always talking in a loud <unk> voice about his mite , or Mrs. Pardiggle ’ s mite , or their five boys ’ <unk> .
Mr. Quale , with his hair brushed back as usual and his knobs of temples shining very much , was also there , not in the character of a disappointed lover , but as the accepted of a young — at least , an <unk> — lady , a Miss Wisk , who was also there .
Miss Wisk ’ s mission , my guardian said , was to show the world that woman ’ s mission was man ’ s mission and that the only genuine mission of both man and woman was to be always moving <unk> <unk> about things in general at public <unk> .
The guests were few , but were , as one might expect at Mrs. Jellyby ’ s , all devoted to public objects only .
Besides those I have mentioned , there was an extremely dirty lady with her bonnet all <unk> and the <unk> price of her dress still sticking on it , whose neglected home , Caddy told me , was like a <unk> wilderness , but whose church was like a fancy fair .
A very <unk> gentleman , who said it was his mission to be everybody ’ s brother but who appeared to be on terms of coolness with the whole of his large family , completed the party .
A party , having less in common with such an occasion , could hardly have been got together by any <unk> .
Such a mean mission as the domestic mission was the very last thing to be <unk> among them ; indeed , Miss Wisk informed us , with great indignation , before we sat down to breakfast , that the idea of woman ’ s mission lying chiefly in the narrow <unk> of home was an <unk> <unk> on the part of her <unk> , man .
One other <unk> was that nobody with a mission — except Mr. Quale , whose mission , as I think I have formerly said , was to be in <unk> with everybody ’ s mission — cared at all for anybody ’ s mission .
Mrs. Pardiggle being as clear that the only one <unk> course was her course of <unk> upon the poor and <unk> benevolence to them like a <unk> ; as Miss Wisk was that the only practical thing for the world was the <unk> of woman from the <unk> of her <unk> , man .
Mrs. Jellyby , all the while , sat smiling at the limited <unk> that could see anything but Borrioboola-Gha .
But I am anticipating now the <unk> of our conversation on the ride home instead of first marrying Caddy .
We all went to church , and Mr. Jellyby gave her away .
Of the air with which old Mr. Turveydrop , with his hat under his left arm ( the inside presented at the <unk> like a <unk> ) and his eyes <unk> themselves up into his wig , stood stiff and high-shouldered behind us <unk> during the ceremony , and afterwards <unk> us , I could never say enough to do it justice .
Miss Wisk , whom I cannot report as prepossessing in appearance , and whose manner was grim , listened to the proceedings , as part of woman ’ s wrongs , with a disdainful face .
Mrs. Jellyby , with her calm smile and her bright eyes , looked the least concerned of all the company .
We <unk> came back to breakfast , and Mrs. Jellyby sat at the head of the table and Mr. Jellyby at the foot .
Caddy had previously <unk> upstairs to <unk> the children again and tell them that her name was Turveydrop .
But this piece of information , instead of being an agreeable surprise to Peepy , threw him on his back in such <unk> of <unk> grief that I could do nothing on being sent for but <unk> to the proposal that he should be admitted to the breakfast table .
So he came down and sat in my lap ; and Mrs. Jellyby , after saying , in reference to the state of his <unk> , “ Oh , you <unk> Peepy , what a shocking little pig you are ! ” was not at all <unk> .
He was very good except that he brought down <unk> with him ( out of an <unk> I had given him before we went to church ) and <unk> <unk> him head first into the <unk> and then put him in his mouth .
My guardian , with his sweet temper and his quick perception and his amiable face , made something agreeable even out of the <unk> company .
None of them seemed able to talk about anything but his , or her , own one subject , and none of them seemed able to talk about even that as part of a world in which there was anything else ; but my guardian turned it all to the merry encouragement of Caddy and the honour of the occasion , and brought us through the breakfast <unk> .
What we should have done without him , I am afraid to think , for all the company <unk> the bride and <unk> and old Mr. Turveydrop — and old Mr. <unk> , in virtue of his deportment , considering himself <unk> superior to all the company — it was a very <unk> case .
At last the time came when poor Caddy was to go and when all her property was <unk> on the <unk> coach and pair that was to take her and her husband to <unk> .
It affected us to see Caddy <unk> , then , to her <unk> home and hanging on her mother ’ s neck with the greatest tenderness .
“ I am very sorry I couldn ’ t go on writing from <unk> , Ma , ” sobbed Caddy .
“ I hope you forgive me now . ” “ Oh , Caddy , Caddy ! ” said Mrs. Jellyby .
“ I have told you over and over again that I have engaged a boy , and there ’ s an end of it . ” “ You are sure you are not the least angry with me , Ma ?
Say you are sure before I go away , Ma ? ” “ You foolish Caddy , ” returned Mrs. Jellyby , “ do I look angry , or have I inclination to be angry , or time to be angry ?
How CAN you ? ” “ Take a little care of Pa while I am gone , <unk> ! ” Mrs. Jellyby positively laughed at the fancy .
“ You romantic child , ” said she , lightly <unk> Caddy ’ s back .
“ Go along .
I am excellent friends with you .
Now , good-bye , Caddy , and be very happy ! ” Then Caddy hung upon her father and <unk> his cheek against hers as if he were some poor dull child in pain .
All this took place in the hall .
Her father released her , took out his pocket handkerchief , and sat down on the stairs with his head against the wall .
I hope he found some consolation in walls .
I almost think he did .
And then Prince took her arm in his and turned with great emotion and respect to his father , whose deportment at that moment was <unk> .
“ Thank you over and over again , father ! ” said Prince , kissing his hand .
“ I am very grateful for all your kindness and consideration regarding our marriage , and so , I can assure you , is Caddy . ” “ Very , ” sobbed Caddy .
“ Ve-ry ! ” “ My dear son , ” said Mr. Turveydrop , “ and dear daughter , I have done my duty .
If the spirit of a <unk> <unk> <unk> above us and looks down on the occasion , that , and your constant affection , will be my <unk> .
You will not fail in YOUR duty , my son and daughter , I believe ? ” “ Dear father , never ! ” cried Prince .
“ Never , never , dear Mr. Turveydrop ! ” said Caddy .
“ This , ” returned Mr. Turveydrop , “ is as it should be .
My children , my home is yours , my heart is yours , my all is yours .
I will never leave you ; nothing but death shall part us .
My dear son , you contemplate an absence of a week , I think ? ” “ A week , dear father .
We shall return home this day week . ” “ My dear child , ” said Mr. Turveydrop , “ let me , even under the present <unk> circumstances , recommend strict <unk> .
It is highly important to keep the connexion together ; and <unk> , if at all neglected , are apt to take offence . ” “ This day week , father , we shall be sure to be home to dinner . ” “ Good ! ” said Mr. Turveydrop .
“ You will find fires , my dear Caroline , in your own room , and dinner prepared in my apartment .
Yes , yes , Prince ! ” anticipating some <unk> objection on his son ’ s part with a great air .
“ You and our Caroline will be strange in the upper part of the premises and will , therefore , dine that day in my apartment .
Now , bless ye ! ” They drove away , and whether I wondered most at Mrs. Jellyby or at Mr. Turveydrop , I did not know .
Ada and my guardian were in the same condition when we came to talk it over .
But before we drove away too , I received a most unexpected and eloquent compliment from Mr. Jellyby .
He came up to me in the hall , took both my hands , pressed them earnestly , and opened his mouth twice .
I was so sure of his meaning that I said , quite <unk> , “ You are very welcome , sir .
Pray don ’ t mention it ! ” “ I hope this marriage is for the best , guardian , ” said I when we three were on our road home .
“ I hope it is , little woman .
<unk> .
We shall see . ” “ Is the wind in the east to-day ? ” I ventured to ask him .
He laughed heartily and answered , “ No . ” “ But it must have been this morning , I think , ” said I.
He answered “ No ” again , and this time my dear girl confidently answered “ No ” too and shook the lovely head which , with its blooming flowers against the golden hair , was like the very spring .
“ Much YOU know of east winds , my ugly darling , ” said I , kissing her in my admiration — I couldn ’ t help it .
Well !
It was only their love for me , I know very well , and it is a long time ago .
I must write it even if I rub it out again , because it gives me so much pleasure .
They said there could be no east wind where Somebody was ; they said that wherever Dame Durden went , there was sunshine and summer air .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> and <unk> I had not been at home again many days when one evening I went upstairs into my own room to take a peep over Charley ’ s shoulder and see how she was getting on with her <unk> .
<unk> was a trying business to Charley , who seemed to have no natural power over a pen , but in whose hand every pen appeared to become <unk> animated , and to go wrong and crooked , and to stop , and <unk> , and <unk> into corners like a <unk> .
It was very odd to see what old letters Charley ’ s young hand had made , they so <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , it so <unk> and round .
Yet Charley was uncommonly <unk> at other things and had as <unk> little fingers as I ever watched .
“ Well , Charley , ” said I , looking over a copy of the letter O in which it was represented as square , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> in all kinds of ways , “ we are improving .
If we only get to make it round , we shall be perfect , Charley . ” Then I made one , and Charley made one , and the pen wouldn ’ t join Charley ’ s neatly , but twisted it up into a <unk> .
“ Never mind , Charley .
We shall do it in time . ” Charley laid down her pen , the copy being finished , opened and shut her <unk> little hand , looked gravely at the page , half in pride and half in doubt , and got up , and dropped me a curtsy .
“ Thank you , miss .
If you please , miss , did you know a poor person of the name of Jenny ? ” “ A brickmaker ’ s wife , Charley ?
Yes . ” “ She came and spoke to me when I was out a little while ago , and said you knew her , miss .
She asked me if I wasn ’ t the young lady ’ s little maid — meaning you for the young lady , miss — and I said yes , miss . ” “ I thought she had left this neighbourhood altogether , Charley . ” “ So she had , miss , but she ’ s come back again to where she used to live — she and Liz .
Did you know another poor person of the name of Liz , miss ? ” “ I think I do , Charley , though not by name . ” “ That ’ s what she said ! ” returned Charley .
“ They have both come back , miss , and have been <unk> high and low . ” “ <unk> high and low , have they , Charley ? ” “ Yes , miss . ” If Charley could only have made the letters in her copy as round as the eyes with which she looked into my face , they would have been excellent .
“ And this poor person came about the house three or four days , hoping to get a glimpse of you , miss — all she wanted , she said — but you were away .
That was when she saw me .
She saw me a-going about , miss , ” said Charley with a short laugh of the greatest delight and pride , “ and she thought I looked like your maid ! ” “ Did she though , really , Charley ? ” “ Yes , miss ! ” said Charley .
“ Really and truly . ” And Charley , with another short laugh of the <unk> <unk> , made her eyes very round again and looked as serious as became my maid .
I was never tired of seeing Charley in the full enjoyment of that great dignity , standing before me with her youthful face and figure , and her steady manner , and her childish <unk> breaking through it now and then in the pleasantest way .
“ And where did you see her , Charley ? ” said I.
My little maid ’ s countenance fell as she replied , “ By the doctor ’ s shop , miss . ” For Charley wore her black frock yet .
I asked if the brickmaker ’ s wife were ill , but Charley said no .
It was some one else .
Some one in her cottage who had <unk> down to Saint Albans and was <unk> he didn ’ t know where .
A poor boy , Charley said .
No father , no mother , no any one .
“ Like as Tom might have been , miss , if Emma and me had died after father , ” said Charley , her round eyes filling with tears .
“ And she was getting medicine for him , Charley ? ” “ She said , miss , ” returned Charley , “ how that he had once done as much for her . ” My little maid ’ s face was so eager and her quiet hands were folded so closely in one another as she stood looking at me that I had no great difficulty in reading her thoughts .
“ Well , Charley , ” said I , “ it appears to me that you and I can do no better than go round to Jenny ’ s and see what ’ s the matter . ” The <unk> with which Charley brought my bonnet and veil , and having dressed me , <unk> <unk> herself into her warm shawl and made herself look like a little old woman , sufficiently expressed her <unk> .
So Charley and I , without saying anything to any one , went out .
It was a cold , wild night , and the trees <unk> in the wind .
The rain had been thick and heavy all day , and with little <unk> for many days .
None was falling just then , however .
The sky had partly cleared , but was very gloomy — even above us , where a few stars were shining .
In the north and <unk> , where the sun had set three hours before , there was a pale dead light both beautiful and awful ; and into it long <unk> lines of cloud <unk> up like a sea <unk> immovable as it was <unk> .
<unk> London a <unk> glare <unk> the whole dark waste , and the contrast between these two lights , and the fancy which the <unk> light <unk> of an <unk> fire , <unk> on all the <unk> buildings of the city and on all the faces of its many thousands of wondering inhabitants , was as solemn as might be .
I had no thought that night — none , I am quite sure — of what was soon to happen to me .
But I have always remembered since that when we had stopped at the <unk> to look up at the sky , and when we went upon our way , I had for a moment an <unk> impression of myself as being something different from what I then was .
I know it was then and there that I had it .
I have ever since connected the feeling with that spot and time and with everything associated with that spot and time , to the distant voices in the town , the <unk> of a dog , and the sound of wheels coming down the <unk> hill .
It was Saturday night , and most of the people belonging to the place where we were going were drinking elsewhere .
We found it quieter than I had previously seen it , though quite as miserable .
The <unk> were burning , and a <unk> <unk> set towards us with a <unk> glare .
We came to the cottage , where there was a feeble candle in the <unk> window .
We tapped at the door and went in .
The mother of the little child who had died was sitting in a chair on one side of the poor fire by the bed ; and opposite to her , a wretched boy , supported by the chimney-piece , was <unk> on the floor .
He held under his arm , like a little bundle , a fragment of a fur cap ; and as he tried to warm himself , he shook until the crazy door and window shook .
The place was closer than before and had an <unk> and a very peculiar smell .
I had not lifted my veil when I first spoke to the woman , which was at the moment of our going in .
The boy <unk> up instantly and <unk> at me with a remarkable expression of surprise and terror .
His action was so quick and my being the cause of it was so evident that I stood still instead of advancing nearer .
“ I won ’ t go no more to the berryin ground , ” <unk> the boy ; “ I ain ’ t a-going there , so I tell you ! ” I lifted my veil and spoke to the woman .
She said to me in a low voice , “ Don ’ t mind him , ma ’ am .
He ’ ll soon come back to his head , ” and said to him , “ Jo , Jo , what ’ s the matter ? ” “ I know wot she ’ s come for ! ” cried the boy .
“ Who ? ” “ The lady there .
She ’ s come to get me to go along with her to the berryin ground .
I won ’ t go to the berryin ground .
I don ’ t like the name on it .
She might go <unk> ME . ” His shivering came on again , and as he leaned against the wall , he shook the <unk> .
“ He has been talking off and on about such like all day , ma ’ am , ” said Jenny softly .
“ Why , how you stare !
This is MY lady , Jo . ” “ Is it ? ” returned the boy <unk> , and <unk> me with his arm held out above his burning eyes .
“ She looks to me the t ’ other one .
It ain ’ t the bonnet , nor yet it ain ’ t the gownd , but she looks to me the t ’ other one . ” My little Charley , with her <unk> experience of illness and trouble , had pulled off her bonnet and shawl and now went quietly up to him with a chair and sat him down in it like an old sick nurse .
Except that no such attendant could have shown him Charley ’ s youthful face , which seemed to engage his confidence .
“ I say ! ” said the boy .
“ YOU tell me .
Ain ’ t the lady the t ’ other lady ? ” Charley shook her head as she <unk> drew his rags about him and made him as warm as she could .
“ Oh ! ” the boy <unk> .
“ Then I s ’ <unk> she ain ’ t . ” “ I came to see if I could do you any good , ” said I.
“ What is the matter with you ? ” “ I ’ m <unk> <unk> , ” returned the boy <unk> , with his haggard gaze wandering about me , “ and then burnt up , and then <unk> , and then burnt up , ever so many times in a hour .
And my head ’ s all <unk> , and all a-going <unk> — and I ’ m so dry — and my bones isn ’ t half so much bones as pain . ” “ When did he come here ? ” I asked the woman .
“ This morning , ma ’ am , I found him at the corner of the town .
I had known him up in London yonder .
Hadn ’ t I , Jo ? ” “ Tom-all-Alone ’ s , ” the boy replied .
Whenever he fixed his attention or his eyes , it was only for a very little while .
He soon began to <unk> his head again , and roll it heavily , and speak as if he were half awake .
“ When did he come from London ? ” I asked .
“ I come from London yes ’ day , ” said the boy himself , now flushed and hot .
“ I ’ m a-going somewheres . ” “ Where is he going ? ” I asked .
“ <unk> , ” repeated the boy in a <unk> tone .
“ I have been moved on , and moved on , more nor ever I was afore , since the t ’ other one give me the <unk> ’ ring .
Mrs. Snagsby , she ’ s always <unk> , and <unk> of me — what have I done to her ? — and they ’ re all <unk> and <unk> of me .
Every one of ’ em ’ s doing of it , from the time when I don ’ t get up , to the time when I don ’ t go to bed .
And I ’ m a-going somewheres .
That ’ s where I ’ m a-going .
She told me , down in Tom-all-Alone ’ s , as she came from <unk> , and so I took the <unk> Road .
It ’ s as good as another . ” He always concluded by addressing Charley .
“ What is to be done with him ? ” said I , taking the woman aside .
“ He could not travel in this state even if he had a purpose and knew where he was going ! ” “ I know no more , ma ’ am , than the dead , ” she replied , glancing <unk> at him .
“ Perhaps the dead know better , if they could only tell us .
I ’ ve kept him here all day for pity ’ s sake , and I ’ ve given him <unk> and <unk> , and Liz has gone to try if any one will take him in ( here ’ s my pretty in the bed — her child , but I call it mine ) ; but I can ’ t keep him long , for if my husband was to come home and find him here , he ’ d be rough in putting him out and might do him a hurt .
<unk> !
Here comes Liz back ! ” The other woman came hurriedly in as she spoke , and the boy got up with a <unk> sense that he was expected to be going .
When the little child awoke , and when and how Charley got at it , took it out of bed , and began to walk about <unk> it , I don ’ t know .
There she was , doing all this in a quiet motherly manner as if she were living in Mrs. Blinder ’ s <unk> with Tom and Emma again .
The friend had been here and there , and had been played about from hand to hand , and had come back as she went .
At first it was too early for the boy to be received into the proper refuge , and at last it was too late .
One official sent her to another , and the other sent her back again to the first , and so backward and forward , until it appeared to me as if both must have been appointed for their skill in <unk> their duties instead of performing them .
And now , after all , she said , breathing quickly , for she had been running and was frightened too , “ Jenny , your master ’ s on the road home , and mine ’ s not far behind , and the Lord help the boy , for we can do no more for him ! ” They put a few halfpence together and hurried them into his hand , and so , in an <unk> , <unk> , <unk> way , he <unk> out of the house .
“ Give me the child , my dear , ” said its mother to Charley , “ and thank you kindly too !
Jenny , woman dear , good night !
Young lady , if my master don ’ t fall out with me , I ’ ll look down by the <unk> by and by , where the boy will be most like , and again in the morning ! ” She hurried off , and presently we passed her <unk> and singing to her child at her own door and looking anxiously along the road for her <unk> husband .
I was afraid of staying then to speak to either woman , lest I should bring her into trouble .
But I said to Charley that we must not leave the boy to die .
Charley , who knew what to do much better than I did , and whose quickness <unk> her presence of mind , <unk> on before me , and presently we came up with Jo , just short of the <unk> .
I think he must have begun his journey with some small bundle under his arm and must have had it <unk> or lost it .
For he still carried his wretched fragment of fur cap like a bundle , though he went <unk> through the rain , which now fell fast .
He stopped when we called to him and again showed a dread of me when I came up , standing with his <unk> eyes fixed upon me , and even arrested in his shivering fit .
I asked him to come with us , and we would take care that he had some shelter for the night .
“ I don ’ t want no shelter , ” he said ; “ I can lay <unk> the warm bricks . ” “ But don ’ t you know that people die there ? ” replied Charley .
“ They dies <unk> , ” said the boy .
“ They dies in their lodgings — she knows where ; I showed her — and they dies down in Tom-all-Alone ’ s in heaps .
They dies more than they lives , according to what I see . ” Then he <unk> whispered Charley , “ If she ain ’ t the t ’ other one , she ain ’ t the <unk> .
Is there <unk> of ’ em then ? ” Charley looked at me a little frightened .
I felt half frightened at myself when the boy <unk> on me so .
But he turned and followed when I <unk> to him , and finding that he acknowledged that influence in me , I led the way straight home .
It was not far , only at the <unk> of the hill .
We passed but one man .
I doubted if we should have got home without assistance , the boy ’ s steps were so uncertain and <unk> .
He made no complaint , however , and was strangely <unk> about himself , if I may say so strange a thing .
Leaving him in the hall for a moment , <unk> into the corner of the window-seat and staring with an indifference that scarcely could be called wonder at the comfort and brightness about him , I went into the drawing-room to speak to my guardian .
There I found Mr. Skimpole , who had come down by the coach , as he frequently did without notice , and never bringing any clothes with him , but always <unk> everything he wanted .
They came out with me directly to look at the boy .
The servants had gathered in the hall too , and he <unk> in the window-seat with Charley standing by him , like some wounded animal that had been found in a <unk> .
“ This is a sorrowful case , ” said my guardian after asking him a question or two and touching him and examining his eyes .
“ What do you say , Harold ? ” “ You had better turn him out , ” said Mr. Skimpole .
“ What do you mean ? ” inquired my guardian , almost sternly .
“ My dear Jarndyce , ” said Mr. Skimpole , “ you know what I am : I am a child .
Be cross to me if I <unk> it .
But I have a <unk> objection to this sort of thing .
I always had , when I was a medical man .
He ’ s not safe , you know .
There ’ s a very bad sort of fever about him . ” Mr. Skimpole had <unk> from the hall to the drawing-room again and said this in his airy way , seated on the <unk> as we stood by .
“ You ’ ll say it ’ s childish , ” observed Mr. Skimpole , looking gaily at us .
“ Well , I dare say it may be ; but I AM a child , and I never pretend to be anything else .
If you put him out in the road , you only put him where he was before .
He will be no worse off than he was , you know .
Even make him better off , if you like .
Give him sixpence , or five shillings , or five pound ten — you are <unk> , and I am not — and get rid of him ! ” “ And what is he to do then ? ” asked my guardian .
“ Upon my life , ” said Mr. Skimpole , <unk> his shoulders with his engaging smile , “ I have not the least idea what he is to do then .
But I have no doubt he ’ ll do it . ” “ Now , is it not a horrible reflection , ” said my guardian , to whom I had hastily explained the <unk> efforts of the two women , “ is it not a horrible reflection , ” walking up and down and <unk> his hair , “ that if this wretched creature were a <unk> prisoner , his hospital would be wide open to him , and he would be as well taken care of as any sick boy in the <unk> ? ” “ My dear Jarndyce , ” returned Mr. Skimpole , “ you ’ ll pardon the simplicity of the question , coming as it does from a creature who is perfectly simple in worldly matters , but why <unk> ’ T he a prisoner then ? ” My guardian stopped and looked at him with a <unk> mixture of amusement and indignation in his face .
“ Our young friend is not to be suspected of any delicacy , I should imagine , ” said Mr. Skimpole , <unk> and candid .
“ It seems to me that it would be wiser , as well as in a certain kind of way more respectable , if he showed some <unk> energy that got him into prison .
There would be more of an <unk> spirit in it , and consequently more of a certain sort of poetry . ” “ I believe , ” returned my guardian , resuming his uneasy walk , “ that there is not such another child on earth as yourself . ” “ Do you really ? ” said Mr. Skimpole .
“ I dare say !
But I confess I don ’ t see why our young friend , in his degree , should not seek to <unk> himself with such poetry as is open to him .
He is no doubt born with an appetite — probably , when he is in a <unk> state of health , he has an excellent appetite .
Very well .
At our young friend ’ s natural dinner hour , most likely about noon , our young friend says in effect to society , ‘ I am hungry ; will you have the goodness to produce your <unk> and <unk> me ? ’ <unk> , which has taken upon itself the general arrangement of the whole system of <unk> and <unk> to have a <unk> for our young friend , does NOT produce that <unk> ; and our young friend , therefore , says ‘ You really must excuse me if I <unk> it . ’ Now , this appears to me a case of <unk> energy , which has a certain amount of reason in it and a certain amount of <unk> ; and I don ’ t know but what I should be more interested in our young friend , as an <unk> of such a case , than merely as a poor vagabond — which any one can be . ” “ In the meantime , ” I ventured to observe , “ he is getting worse . ” “ In the meantime , ” said Mr. Skimpole cheerfully , “ as Miss Summerson , with her practical good sense , observes , he is getting worse .
Therefore I recommend your turning him out before he gets still worse . ” The amiable face with which he said it , I think I shall never forget .
“ Of course , little woman , ” observed my guardian , turning to me , “ I can <unk> his admission into the proper place by merely going there to <unk> it , though it ’ s a bad state of things when , in his condition , that is necessary .
But it ’ s growing late , and is a very bad night , and the boy is worn out already .
There is a bed in the wholesome <unk> by the stable ; we had better keep him there till morning , when he can be wrapped up and removed .
We ’ ll do that . ” “ Oh ! ” said Mr. Skimpole , with his hands upon the keys of the piano as we moved away .
“ Are you going back to our young friend ? ” “ Yes , ” said my guardian .
“ How I <unk> you your <unk> , Jarndyce ! ” returned Mr. Skimpole with playful admiration .
“ You don ’ t mind these things ; neither does Miss Summerson .
You are ready at all times to go anywhere , and do anything .
Such is will !
I have no will at all — and no won ’ t — simply can ’ t . ” “ You can ’ t recommend anything for the boy , I suppose ? ” said my guardian , looking back over his shoulder half angrily ; only half angrily , for he never seemed to consider Mr. Skimpole an <unk> being .
“ My dear Jarndyce , I observed a bottle of <unk> medicine in his pocket , and it ’ s impossible for him to do better than take it .
You can tell them to <unk> a little <unk> about the place where he <unk> and to keep it <unk> cool and him <unk> warm .
But it is mere <unk> in me to offer any <unk> .
Miss Summerson has such a knowledge of detail and such a capacity for the administration of detail that she knows all about it . ” We went back into the hall and explained to Jo what we proposed to do , which Charley explained to him again and which he received with the languid <unk> I had already noticed , <unk> looking on at what was done as if it were for somebody else .
The servants <unk> his miserable state and being very anxious to help , we soon got the <unk> ready ; and some of the men about the house carried him across the wet yard , well wrapped up .
It was pleasant to observe how kind they were to him and how there appeared to be a general impression among them that frequently calling him “ Old <unk> ” was likely to <unk> his spirits .
Charley directed the <unk> and went to and fro between the <unk> and the house with such little <unk> and comforts as we thought it safe to give him .
My guardian himself saw him before he was left for the night and reported to me when he returned to the growlery to write a letter on the boy ’ s behalf , which a messenger was charged to deliver at <unk> in the morning , that he seemed easier and inclined to sleep .
They had fastened his door on the outside , he said , in case of his being <unk> , but had so arranged that he could not make any noise without being heard .
Ada being in our room with a cold , Mr. Skimpole was left alone all this time and entertained himself by playing <unk> of <unk> <unk> and sometimes singing to them ( as we heard at a distance ) with great expression and feeling .
When we rejoined him in the drawing-room he said he would give us a little <unk> which had come into his head “ <unk> of our young friend , ” and he <unk> one about a <unk> boy , “ <unk> on the wide world , <unk> to <unk> and <unk> , <unk> of his parents , <unk> of a home . ” quite <unk> .
It was a song that always made him cry , he told us .
He was extremely gay all the rest of the evening , for he absolutely <unk> — those were his delighted words — when he thought by what a happy talent for business he was surrounded .
He gave us , in his glass of <unk> , “ Better health to our young friend ! ” and supposed and gaily pursued the case of his being reserved like <unk> to become Lord <unk> of London .
In that event , no doubt , he would establish the Jarndyce <unk> and the Summerson <unk> , and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> to St. Albans .
He had no doubt , he said , that our young friend was an excellent boy in his way , but his way was not the Harold Skimpole way ; what Harold Skimpole was , Harold Skimpole had found himself , to his considerable surprise , when he first made his own acquaintance ; he had accepted himself with all his <unk> and had thought it sound philosophy to make the best of the bargain ; and he hoped we would do the same .
Charley ’ s last report was that the boy was quiet .
I could see , from my window , the lantern they had left him burning quietly ; and I went to bed very happy to think that he was <unk> .
There was more movement and more talking than usual a little before <unk> , and it awoke me .
As I was <unk> , I looked out of my window and asked one of our men who had been among the active <unk> last night whether there was anything wrong about the house .
The lantern was still burning in the <unk> .
“ It ’ s the boy , miss , ” said he .
“ Is he worse ? ” I inquired .
“ <unk> , miss . ” “ Dead ! ” “ Dead , miss ?
No .
<unk> clean off . ” At what time of the night he had gone , or how , or why , it seemed hopeless ever to <unk> .
The door remaining as it had been left , and the lantern standing in the window , it could only be supposed that he had got out by a <unk> in the floor which communicated with an empty <unk> below .
But he had shut it down again , if that were so ; and it looked as if it had not been raised .
Nothing of any kind was <unk> .
On this fact being clearly <unk> , we all yielded to the painful belief that <unk> had come upon him in the night and that , <unk> by some imaginary object or pursued by some imaginary horror , he had <unk> away in that worse than helpless state ; all of us , that is to say , but Mr. Skimpole , who repeatedly suggested , in his usual easy light style , that it had occurred to our young friend that he was not a safe <unk> , having a bad kind of fever upon him , and that he had with great natural politeness taken himself off .
Every possible inquiry was made , and every place was <unk> .
The <unk> were examined , the <unk> were visited , the two women were particularly <unk> , but they knew nothing of him , and nobody could doubt that their wonder was genuine .
The weather had for some time been too wet and the night itself had been too wet to admit of any <unk> by footsteps .
<unk> and <unk> , and wall , and <unk> and <unk> , were examined by our men for a long distance round , lest the boy should be lying in such a place insensible or dead ; but nothing was seen to <unk> that he had ever been near .
From the time when he was left in the <unk> , he <unk> .
The search continued for five days .
I do not mean that it ceased even then , but that my attention was then <unk> into a <unk> very memorable to me .
As Charley was at her writing again in my room in the evening , and as I sat opposite to her at work , I felt the table tremble .
<unk> up , I saw my little maid shivering from head to foot .
“ Charley , ” said I , “ are you so cold ? ” “ I think I am , miss , ” she replied .
“ I don ’ t know what it is .
I can ’ t hold myself still .
I felt so yesterday at about this same time , miss .
Don ’ t be uneasy , I think I ’ m ill . ” I heard Ada ’ s voice outside , and I hurried to the door of communication between my room and our pretty sitting-room , and locked it .
Just in time , for she tapped at it while my hand was yet upon the key .
Ada called to me to let her in , but I said , “ Not now , my dearest .
Go away .
There ’ s nothing the matter ; I will come to you presently . ” Ah !
It was a long , long time before my darling girl and I were companions again .
Charley fell ill .
In twelve hours she was very ill .
I moved her to my room , and laid her in my bed , and sat down quietly to nurse her .
I told my guardian all about it , and why I felt it was necessary that I should <unk> myself , and my reason for not seeing my darling above all .
At first she came very often to the door , and called to me , and even <unk> me with <unk> and tears ; but I wrote her a long letter saying that she made me anxious and unhappy and imploring her , as she loved me and wished my mind to be at peace , to come no nearer than the garden .
After that she came beneath the window even oftener than she had come to the door , and if I had learnt to love her dear sweet voice before when we were hardly ever apart , how did I learn to love it then , when I stood behind the <unk> listening and replying , but not so much as looking out !
How did I learn to love it afterwards , when the harder time came !
They put a bed for me in our sitting-room ; and by keeping the door wide open , I turned the two rooms into one , now that Ada had <unk> that part of the house , and kept them always fresh and airy .
There was not a servant in or about the house but was so good that they would all most <unk> have come to me at any hour of the day or night without the least fear or <unk> , but I thought it best to choose one worthy woman who was never to see Ada and whom I could trust to come and go with all precaution .
Through her means I got out to take the air with my guardian when there was no fear of meeting Ada , and wanted for nothing in the way of attendance , any more than in any other respect .
And thus poor Charley <unk> and grew worse , and fell into heavy danger of death , and lay severely ill for many a long round of day and night .
So patient she was , so <unk> , and inspired by such a gentle <unk> that very often as I sat by Charley holding her head in my arms — repose would come to her , so , when it would come to her in no other attitude — I silently prayed to our Father in heaven that I might not forget the lesson which this little sister taught me .
I was very sorrowful to think that Charley ’ s pretty looks would change and be <unk> , even if she recovered — she was such a child with her <unk> face — but that thought was , for the greater part , lost in her greater <unk> .
When she was at the worst , and her mind <unk> again to the cares of her father ’ s sick bed and the little children , she still knew me so far as that she would be quiet in my arms when she could lie quiet nowhere else , and murmur out the <unk> of her mind less <unk> .
At those times I used to think , how should I ever tell the two remaining <unk> that the baby who had learned of her faithful heart to be a mother to them in their need was dead !
There were other times when Charley knew me well and talked to me , telling me that she sent her love to Tom and Emma and that she was sure Tom would grow up to be a good man .
At those times Charley would speak to me of what she had read to her father as well as she could to comfort him , of that young man carried out to be buried who was the only son of his mother and she was a widow , of the <unk> ’ s daughter raised up by the gracious hand upon her bed of death .
And Charley told me that when her father died she had <unk> down and prayed in her first sorrow that he likewise might be raised up and given back to his poor children , and that if she should never get better and should die too , she thought it likely that it might come into Tom ’ s mind to offer the same prayer for her .
Then would I show Tom how these people of old days had been brought back to life on earth , only that we might know our hope to be restored to heaven !
But of all the various times there were in Charley ’ s illness , there was not one when she lost the gentle qualities I have spoken of .
And there were many , many when I thought in the night of the last high belief in the watching angel , and the last higher trust in God , on the part of her poor <unk> father .
And Charley did not die .
She <unk> and slowly turned the dangerous point , after long lingering there , and then began to <unk> .
The hope that never had been given , from the first , of Charley being in outward appearance Charley any more soon began to be encouraged ; and even that <unk> , and I saw her growing into her old childish likeness again .
It was a great morning when I could tell Ada all this as she stood out in the garden ; and it was a great evening when Charley and I at last took tea together in the next room .
But on that same evening , I felt that I was <unk> cold .
<unk> for both of us , it was not until Charley was safe in bed again and <unk> asleep that I began to think the <unk> of her illness was upon me .
I had been able easily to hide what I felt at <unk> , but I was past that already now , and I knew that I was rapidly following in Charley ’ s steps .
I was well enough , however , to be up early in the morning , and to return my darling ’ s cheerful blessing from the garden , and to talk with her as long as usual .
But I was not free from an impression that I had been walking about the two rooms in the night , a little beside myself , though knowing where I was ; and I felt confused at times — with a curious sense of fullness , as if I were becoming too large altogether .
In the evening I was so much worse that I resolved to prepare Charley , with which view I said , “ You ’ re getting quite strong , Charley , are you not ? ” “ Oh , quite ! ” said Charley .
“ <unk> enough to be told a secret , I think , Charley ? ” “ Quite strong enough for that , miss ! ” cried Charley .
But Charley ’ s face fell in the height of her delight , for she saw the secret in MY face ; and she came out of the great chair , and fell upon my bosom , and said “ Oh , miss , it ’ s my doing !
It ’ s my doing ! ” and a great deal more out of the fullness of her grateful heart .
“ Now , Charley , ” said I after letting her go on for a little while , “ if I am to be ill , my great trust , <unk> speaking , is in you .
And unless you are as quiet and composed for me as you always were for yourself , you can never <unk> it , Charley . ” “ If you ’ ll let me cry a little longer , miss , ” said Charley .
“ Oh , my dear , my dear !
If you ’ ll only let me cry a little longer .
Oh , my dear ! ” — how affectionately and <unk> she poured this out as she clung to my neck , I never can remember without tears — “ I ’ ll be good . ” So I let Charley cry a little longer , and it did us both good .
“ Trust in me now , if you please , miss , ” said Charley quietly .
“ I am listening to everything you say . ” “ It ’ s very little at present , Charley .
I shall tell your doctor to-night that I don ’ t think I am well and that you are going to nurse me . ” For that the poor child thanked me with her whole heart .
“ And in the morning , when you hear Miss Ada in the garden , if I should not be quite able to go to the <unk> as usual , do you go , Charley , and say I am asleep — that I have rather tired myself , and am asleep .
At all times keep the room as I have kept it , Charley , and let no one come . ” Charley promised , and I lay down , for I was very heavy .
I saw the doctor that night and asked the favour of him that I wished to ask relative to his saying nothing of my illness in the house as yet .
I have a very indistinct remembrance of that night melting into day , and of day melting into night again ; but I was just able on the first morning to get to the window and speak to my darling .
On the second morning I heard her dear voice — Oh , how dear now ! — outside ; and I asked Charley , with some difficulty ( speech being painful to me ) , to go and say I was asleep .
I heard her answer softly , “ Don ’ t disturb her , Charley , for the world ! ” “ How does my own <unk> look , Charley ? ” I inquired .
“ <unk> , miss , ” said Charley , peeping through the curtain .
“ But I know she is very beautiful this morning . ” “ She is indeed , miss , ” answered Charley , peeping .
“ Still looking up at the window . ” With her blue clear eyes , God bless them , always <unk> when raised like that !
I called Charley to me and gave her her last charge .
“ Now , Charley , when she knows I am ill , she will try to make her way into the room .
<unk> her out , Charley , if you love me truly , to the last !
Charley , if you let her in but once , only to look upon me for one moment as I lie here , I shall die . ” “ I never will !
I never will ! ” she promised me .
“ I believe it , my dear Charley .
And now come and sit beside me for a little while , and touch me with your hand .
For I cannot see you , Charley ; I am blind . ” CHAPTER <unk> The <unk> Time It is night in Lincoln ’ s Inn — perplexed and <unk> <unk> of the shadow of the law , where suitors generally find but little day — and fat candles are <unk> out in offices , and clerks have rattled down the crazy wooden stairs and dispersed .
The bell that rings at nine o ’ clock has ceased its <unk> <unk> about nothing ; the <unk> are shut ; and the <unk> , a solemn <unk> with a mighty power of sleep , keeps guard in his lodge .
From <unk> of staircase windows <unk> lamps like the eyes of Equity , <unk> <unk> with a <unk> pocket for every eye and an eye upon it , dimly <unk> at the stars .
In dirty upper <unk> , here and there , <unk> little <unk> of <unk> <unk> where some wise <unk> and <unk> yet <unk> for the <unk> of real estate in <unk> of <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> of about a dozen of sheep to an <unk> of land .
Over which <unk> <unk> these <unk> of their species linger yet , though <unk> be past , that they may give , for every day , some good account at last .
In the neighbouring court , where the Lord Chancellor of the rag and bottle shop <unk> , there is a general <unk> towards beer and supper .
Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins , whose <unk> <unk> , engaged with a circle of acquaintance in the game of hide and seek , have been lying in <unk> about the <unk> of Chancery Lane for some hours and <unk> the plain of the same thoroughfare to the confusion of passengers — Mrs.
Piper and Mrs. Perkins have but now <unk> <unk> on the children being <unk> , and they still linger on a door-step over a few parting words .
Mr. Krook and his lodger , and the fact of Mr. Krook ’ s being “ continually in <unk> , ” and the <unk> prospects of the young man are , as usual , the <unk> of their conversation .
But they have something to say , likewise , of the Harmonic Meeting at the Sol ’ s Arms , where the sound of the piano through the partly opened windows <unk> out into the court , and where Little Swills , after keeping the <unk> of <unk> in a <unk> like a very <unk> , may now be heard taking the <unk> line in a <unk> piece and <unk> <unk> his friends and <unk> to “ Listen , listen , listen , <unk> the <unk> fall ! ” Mrs. Perkins and Mrs. Piper <unk> opinions on the subject of the young lady of professional <unk> who <unk> at the Harmonic <unk> and who has a space to herself in the manuscript announcement in the window , Mrs. Perkins possessing information that she has been married a year and a half , though announced as Miss M. <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and that her baby is <unk> conveyed to the Sol ’ s Arms every night to receive its natural <unk> during the <unk> .
“ <unk> than which , myself , ” says Mrs. Perkins , “ I would get my living by <unk> <unk> . ” Mrs. Piper , as in duty bound , is of the same opinion , holding that a private station is better than public <unk> , and thanking heaven for her own ( and , by <unk> , Mrs. Perkins ’ ) respectability .
By this time the <unk> of the Sol ’ s Arms appearing with her <unk> well <unk> , Mrs. Piper <unk> that <unk> and retires <unk> , first giving a fair good night to Mrs. Perkins , who has had her own pint in her hand ever since it was fetched from the same <unk> by young Perkins before he was sent to bed .
Now there is a sound of putting up <unk> in the court and a smell as of the smoking of pipes ; and shooting stars are seen in upper windows , further <unk> <unk> to rest .
Now , too , the policeman begins to <unk> at doors ; to try <unk> ; to be suspicious of bundles ; and to <unk> his beat , on the <unk> that every one is either <unk> or being robbed .
It is a close night , though the damp cold is searching too , and there is a <unk> mist a little way up in the air .
It is a fine <unk> night to turn the <unk> , the unwholesome <unk> , the <unk> , bad water , and <unk> to account , and give the <unk> of deaths some extra business .
It may be something in the air — there is plenty in it — or it may be something in himself that is in fault ; but Mr. Weevle , otherwise Jobling , is very ill at ease .
He comes and goes between his own room and the open street door twenty times an hour .
He has been doing so ever since it fell dark .
Since the Chancellor shut up his shop , which he did very early to-night , Mr. Weevle has been down and up , and down and up ( with a cheap tight velvet skull-cap on his head , making his whiskers look out of all <unk> ) , oftener than before .
It is no phenomenon that Mr. Snagsby should be ill at ease too , for he always is so , more or less , under the <unk> influence of the secret that is upon him .
<unk> by the mystery of which he is a <unk> and yet in which he is not a <unk> , Mr. Snagsby <unk> what seems to be its <unk> — the rag and bottle shop in the court .
It has an <unk> attraction for him .
Even now , coming round by the Sol ’ s Arms with the intention of passing down the court , and out at the Chancery Lane end , and so <unk> his <unk> <unk> <unk> of ten minutes ’ long from his own door and back again , Mr. Snagsby <unk> .
“ What , Mr. Weevle ? ” says the stationer , stopping to speak .
“ Are YOU there ? ” “ Aye ! ” says Weevle , “ Here I am , Mr. Snagsby . ” “ <unk> yourself , as I am doing , before you go to bed ? ” the stationer inquires .
“ Why , there ’ s not much air to be got here ; and what there is , is not very <unk> , ” Weevle answers , glancing up and down the court .
“ Very true , sir .
Don ’ t you observe , ” says Mr. Snagsby , pausing to <unk> and taste the air a little , “ don ’ t you observe , Mr. Weevle , that you ’ re — not to put too fine a point upon it — that you ’ re rather <unk> here , sir ? ” “ Why , I have noticed myself that there is a queer kind of flavour in the place to-night , ” Mr. Weevle rejoins .
“ I suppose it ’ s chops at the Sol ’ s Arms . ” “ <unk> , do you think ?
Oh !
<unk> , eh ? ” Mr. Snagsby <unk> and tastes again .
“ Well , sir , I suppose it is .
But I should say their cook at the Sol wanted a little looking after .
She has been burning ’ em , sir !
And I don ’ t think ” — Mr.
Snagsby <unk> and tastes again and then spits and <unk> his mouth — “ I don ’ t think — not to put too fine a point upon it — that they were quite fresh when they were shown the <unk> . ” “ That ’ s very likely .
It ’ s a <unk> sort of weather . ” “ It IS a <unk> sort of weather , ” says Mr. Snagsby , “ and I find it sinking to the spirits . ” “ By George !
I find it gives me the horrors , ” returns Mr. Weevle .
“ Then , you see , you live in a <unk> way , and in a <unk> room , with a black circumstance hanging over it , ” says Mr. Snagsby , looking in past the other ’ s shoulder along the dark passage and then falling back a step to look up at the house .
“ I couldn ’ t live in that room alone , as you do , sir .
I should get so <unk> and <unk> of an evening , sometimes , that I should be driven to come to the door and stand here sooner than sit there .
But then it ’ s very true that you didn ’ t see , in your room , what I saw there .
That makes a difference . ” “ I know quite enough about it , ” returns Tony .
“ It ’ s not agreeable , is it ? ” pursues Mr. Snagsby , coughing his cough of mild <unk> behind his hand .
“ Mr.
Krook ought to consider it in the rent .
I hope he does , I am sure . ” “ I hope he does , ” says Tony .
“ But I doubt it . ” “ You find the rent too high , do you , sir ? ” returns the stationer .
“ <unk> ARE high about here .
I don ’ t know how it is exactly , but the law seems to put things up in price .
Not , ” adds Mr. Snagsby with his apologetic cough , “ that I mean to say a word against the profession I get my living by . ” Mr. Weevle again glances up and down the court and then looks at the stationer .
Mr. Snagsby , <unk> catching his eye , looks upward for a star or so and coughs a cough expressive of not exactly seeing his way out of this conversation .
“ It ’ s a curious fact , sir , ” he observes , slowly rubbing his hands , “ that he should have been — ” “ Who ’ s he ? ” interrupts Mr. Weevle .
“ The deceased , you know , ” says Mr. Snagsby , <unk> his head and right eyebrow towards the staircase and tapping his acquaintance on the <unk> .
“ Ah , to be sure ! ” returns the other as if he were not <unk> of the subject .
“ I thought we had done with him . ” “ I was only going to say it ’ s a curious fact , sir , that he should have come and lived here , and been one of my writers , and then that you should come and live here , and be one of my writers too .
Which there is nothing <unk> , but far from it in the <unk> , ” says Mr. Snagsby , breaking off with a mistrust that he may have <unk> <unk> a kind of <unk> in Mr. Weevle , “ because I have known writers that have gone into <unk> ’ houses and done really very respectable indeed .
<unk> respectable , sir , ” adds Mr. Snagsby with a <unk> that he has not improved the matter .
“ It ’ s a curious coincidence , as you say , ” answers Weevle , once more glancing up and down the court .
“ <unk> a fate in it , don ’ t there ? ” suggests the stationer .
“ There does . ” “ Just so , ” observes the stationer with his <unk> cough .
“ Quite a fate in it .
Quite a fate .
Well , Mr. Weevle , I am afraid I must <unk> you good night ” — Mr.
Snagsby speaks as if it made him desolate to go , though he has been casting about for any means of escape ever since he stopped to speak — “ my little woman will be looking for me else .
Good night , sir ! ” If Mr. Snagsby <unk> home to save his little woman the trouble of looking for him , he might set his mind at rest on that score .
His little woman has had her eye upon him round the Sol ’ s Arms all this time and now glides after him with a pocket handkerchief wrapped over her head , honouring Mr. Weevle and his doorway with a searching glance as she goes past .
“ You ’ ll know me again , ma ’ am , at all events , ” says Mr. Weevle to himself ; “ and I can ’ t compliment you on your appearance , <unk> you are , with your head tied up in a bundle .
Is this fellow <unk> coming ! ” This fellow <unk> as he speaks .
Mr. Weevle softly holds up his finger , and draws him into the passage , and closes the street door .
Then they go upstairs , Mr. Weevle heavily , and Mr. Guppy ( for it is he ) very lightly indeed .
When they are shut into the back room , they speak low .
“ I thought you had gone to <unk> at least instead of coming here , ” says Tony .
“ Why , I said about ten . ” “ You said about ten , ” Tony repeats .
“ Yes , so you did say about ten .
But according to my <unk> , it ’ s ten times ten — it ’ s a hundred o ’ clock .
I never had such a night in my life ! ” “ What has been the matter ? ” “ That ’ s it ! ” says Tony .
“ Nothing has been the matter .
But here have I been <unk> and <unk> in this <unk> old <unk> till I have had the horrors falling on me as thick as <unk> .
<unk> ’ S a <unk> candle ! ” says Tony , pointing to the heavily burning <unk> on his table with a great cabbage head and a long <unk> .
“ That ’ s easily improved , ” Mr. Guppy observes as he takes the <unk> in hand .
“ IS it ? ” returns his friend .
“ Not so easily as you think .
It has been <unk> like that ever since it was lighted . ” “ Why , what ’ s the matter with you , Tony ? ” inquires Mr. Guppy , looking at him , <unk> in hand , as he sits down with his elbow on the table .
“ William Guppy , ” replies the other , “ I am in the <unk> .
It ’ s this <unk> dull , <unk> room — and old <unk> downstairs , I suppose . ” Mr. Weevle moodily <unk> the <unk> from him with his elbow , leans his head on his hand , puts his feet on the <unk> , and looks at the fire .
Mr. Guppy , observing him , slightly <unk> his head and sits down on the other side of the table in an easy attitude .
“ <unk> ’ t that Snagsby talking to you , Tony ? ” “ Yes , and he — yes , it was Snagsby , ” said Mr. Weevle , <unk> the <unk> of his sentence .
“ On business ? ” “ No .
No business .
He was only <unk> by and stopped to prose . ” “ I thought it was Snagsby , ” says Mr. Guppy , “ and thought it as well that he shouldn ’ t see me , so I waited till he was gone . ” “ There we go again , William G. ! ” cried Tony , looking up for an instant .
“ So mysterious and secret !
By George , if we were going to commit a murder , we couldn ’ t have more mystery about it ! ” Mr. Guppy <unk> to smile , and with the view of changing the conversation , looks with an admiration , real or pretended , round the room at the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty , <unk> his <unk> with the portrait of Lady Dedlock over the <unk> , in which she is represented on a terrace , with a <unk> upon the terrace , and a <unk> upon the <unk> , and her shawl upon the <unk> , and a <unk> piece of fur upon the shawl , and her arm on the <unk> piece of fur , and a <unk> on her arm .
“ That ’ s very like Lady Dedlock , ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ It ’ s a speaking likeness . ” “ I wish it was , ” <unk> Tony , without changing his position .
“ I should have some fashionable conversation , here , then . ” <unk> by this time that his friend is not to be <unk> into a more <unk> humour , Mr. Guppy puts about upon the <unk> <unk> and remonstrates with him .
“ Tony , ” says he , “ I can make <unk> for <unk> of spirits , for no man knows what it is when it does come upon a man better than I do , and no man perhaps has a better right to know it than a man who has an <unk> image imprinted on his ’ eart .
But there are <unk> to these things when an <unk> party is in question , and I will acknowledge to you , Tony , that I don ’ t think your manner on the present occasion is hospitable or quite gentlemanly . ” “ This is strong language , William Guppy , ” returns Mr. Weevle .
“ Sir , it may be , ” retorts Mr. William Guppy , “ but I feel strongly when I use it . ” Mr. Weevle admits that he has been wrong and begs Mr. William Guppy to think no more about it .
Mr. William Guppy , however , having got the advantage , cannot quite release it without a little more injured <unk> .
“ No !
<unk> it , Tony , ” says that gentleman , “ you really ought to be careful how you wound the feelings of a man who has an <unk> image imprinted on his ’ eart and who is NOT altogether happy in those chords which <unk> to the <unk> emotions .
You , Tony , possess in yourself all that is calculated to charm the eye and <unk> the taste .
It is not — happily for you , perhaps , and I may wish that I could say the same — it is not your character to <unk> around one flower .
The <unk> garden is open to you , and your airy <unk> carry you through it .
Still , Tony , far be it from me , I am sure , to wound even your feelings without a cause ! ” Tony again <unk> that the subject may be no longer pursued , saying <unk> , “ William Guppy , drop it ! ” Mr. Guppy <unk> , with the reply , “ I never should have taken it up , Tony , of my own <unk> . ” “ And now , ” says Tony , stirring the fire , “ touching this same bundle of letters .
<unk> ’ t it an extraordinary thing of Krook to have appointed twelve o ’ clock to-night to hand ’ em over to me ? ” “ Very .
What did he do it for ? ” “ What does he do anything for ?
HE don ’ t know .
<unk> to-day was his birthday and he ’ d hand ’ em over to-night at twelve o ’ clock .
He ’ ll have drunk himself blind by that time .
He has been at it all day . ” “ He hasn ’ t forgotten the appointment , I hope ? ” “ <unk> ?
Trust him for that .
He never <unk> anything .
I saw him to-night , about eight — helped him to shut up his shop — and he had got the letters then in his <unk> cap .
He pulled it off and showed ’ em me .
When the shop was closed , he took them out of his cap , hung his cap on the chair-back , and stood turning them over before the fire .
I heard him a little while afterwards , through the floor here , <unk> like the wind , the only song he knows — about <unk> , and old <unk> , and <unk> being drunk when he died , or something or other .
He has been as quiet since as an old <unk> asleep in his <unk> . ” “ And you are to go down at twelve ? ” “ At twelve .
And as I tell you , when you came it seemed to me a hundred . ” “ Tony , ” says Mr. Guppy after considering a little with his legs crossed , “ he can ’ t read yet , can he ? ” “ <unk> !
He ’ ll never read .
He can make all the letters <unk> , and he knows most of them <unk> when he sees them ; he has got on that much , under me ; but he can ’ t put them together .
He ’ s too old to <unk> the <unk> of it now — and too drunk . ” “ Tony , ” says Mr. Guppy , <unk> and <unk> his legs , “ how do you suppose he <unk> out that name of Hawdon ? ” “ He never <unk> it out .
You know what a curious power of eye he has and how he has been used to employ himself in copying things by eye alone .
He <unk> it , evidently from the direction of a letter , and asked me what it meant . ” “ Tony , ” says Mr. Guppy , <unk> and <unk> his legs again , “ should you say that the original was a man ’ s writing or a woman ’ s ? ” “ A woman ’ s .
<unk> to one a lady ’ s — <unk> a good deal , and the end of the letter ‘ n , ’ long and hasty . ” Mr. Guppy has been biting his thumb-nail during this <unk> , generally changing the <unk> when he has changed the cross leg .
As he is going to do so again , he happens to look at his <unk> .
It takes his attention .
He stares at it , <unk> .
“ Why , Tony , what on earth is going on in this house to-night ?
Is there a chimney on fire ? ” “ <unk> on fire ! ” “ Ah ! ” returns Mr. Guppy .
“ See how the soot ’ s falling .
See here , on my arm !
See again , on the table here !
<unk> the stuff , it won ’ t blow off — <unk> like black fat ! ” They look at one another , and Tony goes listening to the door , and a little way upstairs , and a little way downstairs .
<unk> back and says it ’ s all right and all quiet , and <unk> the remark he lately made to Mr. Snagsby about their <unk> chops at the Sol ’ s Arms .
“ And it was then , ” resumes Mr. Guppy , still glancing with remarkable <unk> at the <unk> , as they pursue their conversation before the fire , leaning on opposite sides of the table , with their heads very near together , “ that he told you of his having taken the bundle of letters from his lodger ’ s portmanteau ? ” “ That was the time , sir , ” answers Tony , faintly adjusting his whiskers .
“ <unk> I wrote a line to my dear boy , the Honourable William Guppy , informing him of the appointment for to-night and <unk> him not to call before , <unk> being a <unk> . ” The light vivacious tone of fashionable life which is usually assumed by Mr. Weevle sits so ill upon him to-night that he <unk> that and his whiskers together , and after looking over his shoulder , appears to yield himself up a prey to the horrors again .
“ You are to bring the letters to your room to read and <unk> , and to get yourself into a position to tell him all about them .
That ’ s the arrangement , isn ’ t it , Tony ? ” asks Mr. Guppy , anxiously biting his thumb-nail .
“ You can ’ t speak too low .
Yes .
That ’ s what he and I agreed . ” “ I tell you what , Tony — ” “ You can ’ t speak too low , ” says Tony once more .
Mr. Guppy nods his sagacious head , advances it yet closer , and drops into a whisper .
“ I tell you what .
The first thing to be done is to make another <unk> like the real one so that if he should ask to see the real one while it ’ s in my possession , you can show him the <unk> . ” “ And suppose he <unk> the <unk> as soon as he sees it , which with his biting <unk> of an eye is about five hundred times more likely than not , ” suggests Tony .
“ Then we ’ ll face it out .
They don ’ t belong to him , and they never did .
You found that , and you placed them in my hands — a legal friend of yours — for security .
If he <unk> us to it , they ’ ll be <unk> , won ’ t they ? ” “ Ye-es , ” is Mr. Weevle ’ s <unk> admission .
“ Why , Tony , ” remonstrates his friend , “ how you look !
You don ’ t doubt William Guppy ?
You don ’ t suspect any harm ? ” “ I don ’ t suspect anything more than I know , William , ” returns the other gravely .
“ And what do you know ? ” <unk> Mr. Guppy , raising his voice a little ; but on his friend ’ s once more warning him , “ I tell you , you can ’ t speak too low , ” he repeats his question without any sound at all , <unk> with his lips only the words , “ What do you know ? ” “ I know three things .
First , I know that here we are whispering in secrecy , a pair of <unk> . ” “ Well ! ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ And we had better be that than a pair of <unk> , which we should be if we were doing anything else , for it ’ s the only way of doing what we want to do .
Secondly ? ” “ Secondly , it ’ s not made out to me how it ’ s likely to be <unk> , after all . ” Mr. Guppy casts up his eyes at the portrait of Lady Dedlock over the <unk> and replies , “ Tony , you are asked to leave that to the honour of your friend .
Besides its being calculated to serve that friend in those chords of the human mind which — which need not be called into <unk> <unk> on the present occasion — your friend is no fool .
What ’ s that ? ” “ It ’ s eleven o ’ clock striking by the bell of Saint <unk> ’ s .
Listen and you ’ ll hear all the bells in the city <unk> . ” Both sit silent , listening to the metal voices , near and distant , <unk> from towers of various heights , in tones more various than their <unk> .
When these at length <unk> , all seems more mysterious and quiet than before .
One disagreeable result of whispering is that it seems to <unk> an atmosphere of silence , <unk> by the ghosts of sound — strange <unk> and <unk> , the rustling of <unk> that have no substance in them , and the tread of dreadful feet that would leave no mark on the <unk> or the winter snow .
So sensitive the two friends happen to be that the air is full of these <unk> , and the two look over their shoulders by one consent to see that the door is shut .
“ Yes , Tony ? ” says Mr. Guppy , drawing nearer to the fire and biting his <unk> thumb-nail .
“ You were going to say , <unk> ? ” “ It ’ s far from a pleasant thing to be <unk> about a dead man in the room where he died , especially when you happen to live in it . ” “ But we are <unk> nothing against him , Tony . ” “ May be not , still I don ’ t like it .
<unk> here by yourself and see how YOU like it . ” “ As to dead men , Tony , ” proceeds Mr. Guppy , <unk> this proposal , “ there have been dead men in most rooms . ” “ I know there have , but in most rooms you let them alone , and — and they let you alone , ” Tony answers .
The two look at each other again .
Mr. Guppy makes a hurried remark to the effect that they may be doing the deceased a service , that he hopes so .
There is an <unk> blank until Mr. Weevle , by stirring the fire suddenly , makes Mr. Guppy start as if his heart had been stirred instead .
“ <unk> !
Here ’ s more of this <unk> soot hanging about , ” says he .
“ Let us open the window a bit and get a <unk> of air .
It ’ s too close . ” He <unk> the <unk> , and they both rest on the window-sill , half in and half out of the room .
The neighbouring houses are too near to admit of their seeing any sky without <unk> their <unk> and looking up , but lights in <unk> windows here and there , and the rolling of distant carriages , and the new expression that there is of the stir of men , they find to be comfortable .
Mr. Guppy , <unk> tapping on the window-sill , resumes his whispering in quite a <unk> tone .
“ By the by , Tony , don ’ t forget old Smallweed , ” meaning the younger of that name .
“ I have not let him into this , you know .
That grandfather of his is too keen by half .
It runs in the family . ” “ I remember , ” says Tony .
“ I am up to all that . ” “ And as to Krook , ” resumes Mr. Guppy .
“ Now , do you suppose he really has got hold of any other papers of importance , as he has <unk> to you , since you have been such <unk> ? ” Tony shakes his head .
“ I don ’ t know .
Can ’ t imagine .
If we get through this business without <unk> his suspicions , I shall be better informed , no doubt .
How can I know without seeing them , when he don ’ t know himself ?
He is always <unk> out words from them , and <unk> them over the table and the <unk> , and asking what this is and what that is ; but his whole stock from beginning to end may easily be the waste-paper he bought it as , for anything I can say .
It ’ s a <unk> with him to think he is possessed of documents .
He has been going to learn to read them this last quarter of a century , I should judge , from what he tells me . ” “ How did he first come by that idea , though ?
That ’ s the question , ” Mr. Guppy suggests with one eye shut , after a little forensic <unk> .
“ He may have found papers in something he bought , where papers were not supposed to be , and may have got it into his shrewd head from the manner and place of their <unk> that they are worth something . ” “ Or he may have been taken in , in some pretended bargain .
Or he may have been <unk> altogether by long staring at whatever he <unk> got , and by drink , and by hanging about the Lord Chancellor ’ s Court and hearing of documents for ever , ” returns Mr. Weevle .
Mr. Guppy sitting on the window-sill , nodding his head and <unk> all these <unk> in his mind , continues thoughtfully to tap it , and <unk> it , and measure it with his hand , until he hastily draws his hand away .
“ What , in the devil ’ s name , ” he says , “ is this !
Look at my fingers ! ” A thick , yellow <unk> <unk> them , which is offensive to the touch and sight and more offensive to the smell .
A stagnant , <unk> oil with some natural <unk> in it that makes them both shudder .
“ What have you been doing here ?
What have you been <unk> out of window ? ” “ I <unk> out of window !
Nothing , I <unk> !
Never , since I have been here ! ” cries the lodger .
And yet look here — and look here !
When he brings the candle here , from the corner of the window-sill , it slowly <unk> and <unk> away down the bricks , here lies in a little thick <unk> <unk> .
“ This is a horrible house , ” says Mr. Guppy , shutting down the window .
“ Give me some water or I shall cut my hand off . ” He so <unk> , and rubs , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , that he has not long restored himself with a glass of <unk> and stood silently before the fire when Saint <unk> ’ s bell strikes twelve and all those other bells strike twelve from their towers of various heights in the dark air , and in their many tones .
When all is quiet again , the lodger says , “ It ’ s the appointed time at last .
Shall I go ? ” Mr. Guppy nods and gives him a “ <unk> touch ” on the back , but not with the washed hand , though it is his right hand .
He goes downstairs , and Mr. Guppy tries to <unk> himself before the fire for waiting a long time .
But in no more than a minute or two the stairs <unk> and Tony comes swiftly back .
“ Have you got them ? ” “ <unk> them !
No .
The old man ’ s not there . ” He has been so <unk> frightened in the short interval that his terror <unk> the other , who makes a rush at him and asks <unk> , “ What ’ s the matter ? ” “ I couldn ’ t make him hear , and I softly opened the door and looked in .
And the burning smell is there — and the soot is there , and the oil is there — and he is not there ! ” Tony ends this with a groan .
Mr. Guppy takes the light .
They go down , more dead than alive , and holding one another , <unk> open the door of the back shop .
The cat has <unk> close to it and stands <unk> , not at them , at something on the ground before the fire .
There is a very little fire left in the grate , but there is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the room and a dark , <unk> <unk> on the walls and ceiling .
The chairs and table , and the bottle so rarely absent from the table , all stand as usual .
On one chair-back hang the old man ’ s <unk> cap and coat .
“ Look ! ” whispers the lodger , pointing his friend ’ s attention to these objects with a trembling finger .
“ I told you so .
When I saw him last , he took his cap off , took out the little bundle of old letters , hung his cap on the back of the chair — his coat was there already , for he had pulled that off before he went to put the shutters up — and I left him turning the letters over in his hand , standing just where that <unk> black thing is upon the floor . ” Is he hanging somewhere ?
They look up .
No .
“ See ! ” whispers Tony .
“ At the foot of the same chair there lies a dirty bit of thin red <unk> that they tie up pens with .
That went round the letters .
He <unk> it slowly , <unk> and laughing at me , before he began to turn them over , and threw it there .
I saw it fall . ” “ What ’ s the matter with the cat ? ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ Look at her ! ” “ <unk> , I think .
And no wonder in this evil place . ” They advance slowly , looking at all these things .
The cat remains where they found her , still <unk> at the something on the ground before the fire and between the two chairs .
What is it ?
Hold up the light .
Here is a small burnt <unk> of <unk> ; here is the <unk> from a little bundle of burnt paper , but not so light as usual , seeming to be <unk> in something ; and here is — is it the <unk> of a small <unk> and broken <unk> of wood <unk> with white ashes , or is it coal ?
Oh , horror , he IS here !
And this from which we run away , striking out the light and <unk> one another into the street , is all that <unk> him .
<unk> , help , help !
Come into this house for heaven ’ s sake !
<unk> will come in , but none can help .
The Lord Chancellor of that court , true to his title in his last act , has died the death of all lord <unk> in all courts and of all authorities in all places under all names <unk> , where false <unk> are made , and where injustice is done .
Call the death by any name your Highness will , <unk> it to whom you will , or say it might have been prevented how you will , it is the same death <unk> — <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> body itself , and that only — spontaneous combustion , and none other of all the deaths that can be died .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> Now do those two gentlemen not very neat about the <unk> and buttons who attended the last coroner ’ s inquest at the Sol ’ s Arms <unk> in the <unk> with surprising <unk> ( being , in fact , <unk> fetched by the active and intelligent beadle ) , and <unk> <unk> through the court , and <unk> into the Sol ’ s parlour , and write with <unk> little pens on <unk> .
Now do they note down , in the watches of the night , how the neighbourhood of Chancery Lane was yesterday , at about midnight , thrown into a state of the most intense agitation and excitement by the following <unk> and horrible discovery .
Now do they set forth how it will <unk> be remembered that some time back a painful sensation was created in the public mind by a case of mysterious death from opium <unk> in the first floor of the house occupied as a rag , bottle , and general <unk> <unk> shop , by an eccentric individual of <unk> habits , far advanced in life , named Krook ; and how , by a remarkable coincidence , Krook was examined at the inquest , which it may be <unk> was held on that occasion at the Sol ’ s Arms , a <unk> <unk> immediately adjoining the premises in question on the west side and <unk> to a highly respectable landlord , Mr. James George Bogsby .
Now do they show ( in as many words as possible ) how during some hours of yesterday evening a very peculiar smell was observed by the inhabitants of the court , in which the <unk> occurrence which forms the subject of that present account <unk> ; and which <unk> was at one time so powerful that Mr. Swills , a <unk> vocalist professionally engaged by Mr. <unk> G. Bogsby , has himself stated to our <unk> that he mentioned to Miss M. <unk> , a lady of some pretensions to musical <unk> , likewise engaged by Mr. <unk> G. Bogsby to sing at a series of <unk> called Harmonic <unk> , or <unk> , which it would appear are held at the Sol ’ s Arms under Mr. Bogsby ’ s direction <unk> to the <unk> of George the Second , that he ( Mr. Swills ) found his voice seriously affected by the <unk> state of the atmosphere , his <unk> expression at the time being that he was like an empty post-office , for he hadn ’ t a single note in him .
How this account of Mr. Swills is entirely <unk> by two intelligent married <unk> residing in the same court and known <unk> by the names of Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins , both of whom observed the <unk> <unk> and regarded them as being <unk> from the premises in the occupation of Krook , the unfortunate deceased .
All this and a great deal more the two gentlemen who have formed an <unk> <unk> in the melancholy <unk> write down on the spot ; and the boy <unk> of the court ( out of bed in a moment ) <unk> up the shutters of the Sol ’ s Arms parlour , to behold the <unk> of their heads while they are about it .
The whole court , <unk> as well as boy , is <unk> for that night , and can do nothing but <unk> up its many heads , and talk of the ill-fated house , and look at it .
Miss Flite has been <unk> <unk> from her chamber , as if it were in <unk> , and <unk> with a bed at the Sol ’ s Arms .
The Sol neither turns off its gas nor shuts its door all night , for any kind of public excitement makes good for the Sol and causes the court to stand in need of comfort .
The house has not done so much in the <unk> article of <unk> or in <unk> warm since the inquest .
The moment the <unk> heard what had happened , he rolled up his <unk> tight to his shoulders and said , “ There ’ ll be a run upon us ! ” In the first <unk> , young Piper dashed off for the <unk> and returned in triumph at a <unk> <unk> <unk> up <unk> on the <unk> and holding on to that <unk> creature with all his might in the midst of <unk> and <unk> .
One <unk> remains behind after careful <unk> of all <unk> and <unk> and slowly paces up and down before the house in company with one of the two <unk> who have likewise been left in charge thereof .
To this <unk> everybody in the court possessed of sixpence has an <unk> desire to <unk> <unk> in a <unk> form .
Mr. Weevle and his friend Mr. Guppy are within the bar at the Sol and are worth anything to the Sol that the bar <unk> if they will only stay there .
“ This is not a time , ” says Mr. Bogsby , “ to <unk> about money , ” though he looks something sharply after it , over the counter ; “ give your orders , you two gentlemen , and you ’ re welcome to whatever you put a name to . ” Thus entreated , the two gentlemen ( Mr. Weevle especially ) put names to so many things that in course of time they find it difficult to put a name to anything quite distinctly , though they still relate to all <unk> some <unk> of the night they have had of it , and of what they said , and what they thought , and what they saw .
Meanwhile , one or other of the <unk> often <unk> about the door , and pushing it open a little way at the full length of his arm , looks in from outer gloom .
Not that he has any suspicions , but that he may as well know what they are up to in there .
Thus night pursues its leaden course , finding the court still out of bed through the <unk> hours , still <unk> and being treated , still conducting itself <unk> to a court that has had a little money left it unexpectedly .
Thus night at length with <unk> steps departs , and the <unk> going his <unk> , like an <unk> to a <unk> king , strikes off the little heads of fire that have aspired to <unk> the darkness .
Thus the day <unk> , whether or no .
And the day may <unk> , even with its dim London eye , that the court has been up all night .
Over and above the faces that have fallen <unk> on tables and the heels that lie <unk> on hard <unk> instead of beds , the brick and mortar <unk> of the very court itself looks worn and <unk> .
And now the neighbourhood , waking up and beginning to hear of what has happened , comes <unk> in , half dressed , to ask questions ; and the two <unk> and the <unk> ( who are far less <unk> <unk> than the court ) have enough to do to keep the door .
“ Good gracious , gentlemen ! ” says Mr. Snagsby , coming up .
“ What ’ s this I hear ! ” “ Why , it ’ s true , ” returns one of the <unk> .
“ That ’ s what it is .
Now move on here , come ! ” “ Why , good gracious , gentlemen , ” says Mr. Snagsby , somewhat promptly backed away , “ I was at this door last night <unk> ten and eleven o ’ clock in conversation with the young man who lodges here . ” “ Indeed ? ” returns the policeman .
“ You will find the young man next door then .
Now move on here , some of you . ” “ Not hurt , I hope ? ” says Mr. Snagsby .
“ <unk> ?
No .
What ’ s to hurt him ! ” Mr. Snagsby , wholly unable to answer this or any question in his troubled mind , repairs to the Sol ’ s Arms and finds Mr. Weevle <unk> over tea and toast with a considerable expression on him of exhausted excitement and exhausted <unk> .
“ And Mr. Guppy likewise ! ” quoth Mr. Snagsby .
“ Dear , dear , dear !
What a fate there seems in all this !
And my <unk> — ” Mr. Snagsby ’ s power of speech <unk> him in the <unk> of the words “ my little woman . ” For to see that injured female walk into the Sol ’ s Arms at that hour of the morning and stand before the <unk> , with her eyes fixed upon him like an <unk> spirit , strikes him dumb .
“ My dear , ” says Mr. Snagsby when his tongue is <unk> , “ will you take anything ?
A little — not to put too fine a point upon it — drop of <unk> ? ” “ No , ” says Mrs. Snagsby .
“ My love , you know these two gentlemen ? ” “ Yes ! ” says Mrs. Snagsby , and in a <unk> manner <unk> their presence , still fixing Mr. Snagsby with her eye .
The devoted Mr. Snagsby cannot bear this treatment .
He takes Mrs. Snagsby by the hand and leads her aside to an <unk> <unk> .
“ My little woman , why do you look at me in that way ?
Pray don ’ t do it . ” “ I can ’ t help my looks , ” says Mrs. Snagsby , “ and if I could I wouldn ’ t . ” Mr. Snagsby , with his cough of <unk> , rejoins , “ <unk> ’ t you really , my dear ? ” and <unk> .
Then coughs his cough of trouble and says , “ This is a dreadful mystery , my love ! ” still fearfully disconcerted by Mrs. Snagsby ’ s eye .
“ It IS , ” returns Mrs. Snagsby , shaking her head , “ a dreadful mystery . ” “ My little woman , ” <unk> Mr. Snagsby in a <unk> manner , “ don ’ t for goodness ’ sake speak to me with that bitter expression and look at me in that searching way !
I beg and entreat of you not to do it .
Good Lord , you don ’ t suppose that I would go <unk> <unk> any person , my dear ? ” “ I can ’ t say , ” returns Mrs. Snagsby .
On a hasty <unk> of his unfortunate position , Mr. Snagsby “ can ’ t say ” either .
He is not prepared positively to deny that he may have had something to do with it .
He has had something — he don ’ t know what — to do with so much in this connexion that is mysterious that it is possible he may even be <unk> , without knowing it , in the present transaction .
He faintly <unk> his forehead with his handkerchief and gasps .
“ My life , ” says the unhappy stationer , “ would you have any objections to mention why , being in general so delicately <unk> in your conduct , you come into a <unk> before breakfast ? ” “ Why do YOU come here ? ” inquires Mrs. Snagsby .
“ My dear , merely to know the rights of the fatal accident which has happened to the venerable party who has been — <unk> . ” Mr. Snagsby has made a pause to <unk> a groan .
“ I should then have related them to you , my love , over your French roll . ” “ I dare say you would !
You relate everything to me , Mr. Snagsby . ” “ Every — my <unk> — ” “ I should be glad , ” says Mrs. Snagsby after contemplating his increased confusion with a severe and <unk> smile , “ if you would come home with me ; I think you may be <unk> there , Mr. Snagsby , than anywhere else . ” “ My love , I don ’ t know but what I may be , I am sure .
I am ready to go . ” Mr. Snagsby casts his eye <unk> round the bar , gives Messrs. Weevle and Guppy good morning , <unk> them of the satisfaction with which he sees them <unk> , and accompanies Mrs. Snagsby from the Sol ’ s Arms .
Before night his doubt whether he may not be responsible for some <unk> part in the <unk> which is the talk of the whole neighbourhood is almost resolved into certainty by Mrs. Snagsby ’ s <unk> in that fixed gaze .
His mental <unk> are so great that he <unk> wandering ideas of delivering himself up to justice and <unk> to be cleared if innocent and punished with the utmost <unk> of the law if guilty .
Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy , having taken their breakfast , step into Lincoln ’ s Inn to take a little walk about the square and clear as many of the dark <unk> out of their brains as a little walk may .
“ There can be no more favourable time than the present , Tony , ” says Mr. Guppy after they have <unk> made out the four sides of the square , “ for a word or two between us upon a point on which we must , with very little delay , come to an understanding . ” “ Now , I tell you what , William G. ! ” returns the other , eyeing his companion with a <unk> eye .
“ If it ’ s a point of <unk> , you needn ’ t take the trouble to mention it .
I have had enough of that , and I ain ’ t going to have any more .
We shall have YOU taking fire next or blowing up with a <unk> . ” This <unk> phenomenon is so very disagreeable to Mr. Guppy that his voice <unk> as he says in a moral way , “ Tony , I should have thought that what we went through last night would have been a lesson to you never to be personal any more as long as you lived . ” To which Mr. Weevle returns , “ William , I should have thought it would have been a lesson to YOU never to <unk> any more as long as you lived . ” To which Mr. Guppy says , “ Who ’ s <unk> ? ” To which Mr. Jobling replies , “ Why , YOU are ! ” To which Mr. Guppy retorts , “ No , I am not . ” To which Mr. Jobling retorts again , “ Yes , you are ! ” To which Mr. Guppy retorts , “ Who says so ? ” To which Mr. Jobling retorts , “ I say so ! ” To which Mr. Guppy retorts , “ Oh , indeed ? ” To which Mr. Jobling retorts , “ Yes , indeed ! ” And both being now in a <unk> state , they walk on silently for a while to cool down again .
“ Tony , ” says Mr. Guppy then , “ if you heard your friend out instead of flying at him , you wouldn ’ t fall into mistakes .
But your temper is hasty and you are not considerate .
<unk> in yourself , Tony , all that is calculated to charm the eye — ” “ Oh !
<unk> the eye ! ” cries Mr. Weevle , cutting him short .
“ Say what you have got to say ! ” <unk> his friend in this <unk> and material condition , Mr. Guppy only expresses the finer feelings of his soul through the tone of injury in which he <unk> , “ Tony , when I say there is a point on which we must come to an understanding pretty soon , I say so quite apart from any kind of <unk> , however innocent .
You know it is professionally arranged beforehand in all cases that are tried what facts the witnesses are to prove .
Is it or is it not desirable that we should know what facts we are to prove on the inquiry into the death of this unfortunate old <unk> — gentleman ? ” ( Mr. Guppy was going to say “ <unk> , ” but thinks “ gentleman ” better suited to the circumstances . )
“ What facts ?
THE facts . ” “ The facts bearing on that inquiry .
Those are ” — Mr.
Guppy tells them off on his fingers — “ what we knew of his habits , when you saw him last , what his condition was then , the discovery that we made , and how we made it . ” “ Yes , ” says Mr. Weevle .
“ Those are about the facts . ” “ We made the discovery in consequence of his having , in his eccentric way , an appointment with you at twelve o ’ clock at night , when you were to explain some writing to him as you had often done before on account of his not being able to read .
I , <unk> the evening with you , was called down — and so forth .
The inquiry being only into the circumstances touching the death of the deceased , it ’ s not necessary to go beyond these facts , I suppose you ’ ll agree ? ” “ No ! ” returns Mr. Weevle .
“ I suppose not . ” “ And this is not a <unk> , perhaps ? ” says the injured Guppy .
“ No , ” returns his friend ; “ if it ’ s nothing worse than this , I withdraw the observation . ” “ Now , Tony , ” says Mr. Guppy , taking his arm again and walking him slowly on , “ I should like to know , in a friendly way , whether you have yet thought over the many advantages of your <unk> to live at that place ? ” “ What do you mean ? ” says Tony , stopping .
“ Whether you have yet thought over the many advantages of your <unk> to live at that place ? ” repeats Mr. Guppy , walking him on again .
“ At what place ?
THAT place ? ” pointing in the direction of the rag and bottle shop .
Mr. Guppy nods .
“ Why , I wouldn ’ t pass another night there for any consideration that you could offer me , ” says Mr. Weevle , <unk> staring .
“ Do you mean it though , Tony ? ” “ <unk> it !
Do I look as if I mean it ?
I feel as if I do ; I know that , ” says Mr. Weevle with a very genuine shudder .
“ Then the possibility or probability — for such it must be considered — of your never being disturbed in possession of those effects lately belonging to a <unk> old man who seemed to have no relation in the world , and the certainty of your being able to find out what he really had got <unk> up there , don ’ t <unk> with you at all against last night , Tony , if I understand you ? ” says Mr. Guppy , biting his <unk> with the appetite of vexation .
“ Certainly not .
<unk> in that cool way of a fellow ’ s living there ? ” cries Mr. Weevle indignantly .
“ Go and live there yourself . ” “ Oh !
I , Tony ! ” says Mr. Guppy , <unk> him .
“ I have never lived there and couldn ’ t get a lodging there now , <unk> you have got one . ” “ You are welcome to it , ” rejoins his friend , “ and — <unk> ! — you may make yourself at home in it . ” “ Then you really and truly at this point , ” says Mr. Guppy , “ give up the whole thing , if I understand you , Tony ? ” “ You never , ” returns Tony with a most <unk> <unk> , “ said a <unk> word in all your life .
I do ! ” While they are so <unk> , a <unk> drives into the square , on the box of which <unk> a very tall hat makes itself <unk> to the public .
<unk> the coach , and consequently not so <unk> to the <unk> , though sufficiently so to the two friends , for the coach stops almost at their feet , are the venerable Mr. Smallweed and Mrs. Smallweed , accompanied by their granddaughter Judy .
An air of haste and excitement <unk> the party , and as the tall hat ( <unk> Mr. Smallweed the younger ) alights , Mr. Smallweed the elder pokes his head out of window and <unk> to Mr. Guppy , “ How de do , sir !
How de do ! ” “ What do <unk> and his family want here at this time of the morning , I wonder ! ” says Mr. Guppy , nodding to his familiar .
“ My dear sir , ” cries Grandfather Smallweed , “ would you do me a favour ?
Would you and your friend be so very <unk> as to carry me into the public-house in the court , while Bart and his sister bring their grandmother along ?
Would you do an old man that good turn , sir ? ” Mr. Guppy looks at his friend , repeating inquiringly , “ The public-house in the court ? ” And they prepare to bear the venerable burden to the Sol ’ s Arms .
“ There ’ s your <unk> ! ” says the <unk> to the <unk> with a fierce <unk> and shaking his incapable <unk> at him .
“ Ask me for a penny more , and I ’ ll have my <unk> <unk> upon you .
My dear young men , be easy with me , if you please .
<unk> me to catch you round the neck .
I won ’ t <unk> you tighter than I can help .
Oh , Lord !
Oh , dear me !
Oh , my bones ! ” It is well that the Sol is not far off , for Mr. Weevle presents an <unk> appearance before half the distance is accomplished .
With no worse <unk> of his <unk> , however , than the utterance of <unk> <unk> sounds expressive of <unk> <unk> , he <unk> his share of the <unk> and the benevolent old gentleman is deposited by his own desire in the parlour of the Sol ’ s Arms .
“ Oh , Lord ! ” gasps Mr. Smallweed , looking about him , breathless , from an arm-chair .
“ Oh , dear me !
Oh , my bones and back !
Oh , my <unk> and pains !
Sit down , you dancing , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> !
Sit down ! ” This little <unk> to Mrs. Smallweed is <unk> by a <unk> on the part of that <unk> old lady whenever she finds herself on her feet to <unk> about and “ set ” to <unk> objects , <unk> herself with a chattering noise , as in a <unk> dance .
A nervous affection has probably as much to do with these <unk> as any imbecile intention in the poor old woman , but on the present occasion they are so particularly lively in connexion with the <unk> arm-chair , fellow to that in which Mr. Smallweed is seated , that she only quite <unk> when her <unk> have held her down in it , her lord in the meanwhile <unk> upon her , with great <unk> , the endearing <unk> of “ a <unk> <unk> , ” repeated a surprising number of times .
“ My dear sir , ” Grandfather Smallweed then proceeds , addressing Mr. Guppy , “ there has been a calamity here .
Have you heard of it , either of you ? ” “ <unk> of it , sir !
Why , we discovered it . ” “ You discovered it .
You two discovered it !
Bart , THEY discovered it ! ” The two <unk> stare at the <unk> , who return the compliment .
“ My dear friends , ” <unk> Grandfather Smallweed , putting out both his hands , “ I owe you a thousand thanks for <unk> the melancholy office of discovering the ashes of Mrs. Smallweed ’ s brother . ” “ Eh ? ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ Mrs.
Smallweed ’ s brother , my dear friend — her only relation .
We were not on terms , which is to be <unk> now , but he never <unk> be on terms .
He was not fond of us .
He was eccentric — he was very eccentric .
Unless he has left a will ( which is not at all likely ) I shall take out letters of administration .
I have come down to look after the property ; it must be <unk> up , it must be protected .
I have come down , ” repeats Grandfather Smallweed , <unk> the air towards him with all his ten fingers at once , “ to look after the property . ” “ I think , Small , ” says the <unk> Mr. Guppy , “ you might have mentioned that the old man was your uncle . ” “ You two were so close about him that I thought you would like me to be the same , ” returns that old bird with a secretly <unk> eye .
“ Besides , I wasn ’ t proud of him . ” “ Besides which , it was nothing to you , you know , whether he was or not , ” says Judy .
Also with a secretly <unk> eye .
“ He never saw me in his life to know me , ” observed Small ; “ I don ’ t know why I should <unk> HIM , I am sure ! ” “ No , he never communicated with us , which is to be <unk> , ” the old gentleman strikes in , “ but I have come to look after the property — to look over the papers , and to look after the property .
We shall make good our title .
It is in the hands of my solicitor .
Mr. Tulkinghorn , of Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields , over the way there , is so good as to act as my solicitor ; and grass don ’ t grow under HIS feet , I can tell ye .
Krook was Mrs. Smallweed ’ s only brother ; she had no relation but Krook , and Krook had no relation but Mrs. Smallweed .
I am speaking of your brother , you brimstone <unk> , that was <unk> years of age . ” Mrs. Smallweed instantly begins to shake her head and pipe up , “ <unk> pound seven and <unk> !
<unk> thousand bags of money !
<unk> hundred thousand million of <unk> of <unk> ! ” “ Will somebody give me a <unk> pot ? ” exclaims her <unk> husband , looking <unk> about him and finding no <unk> within his reach .
“ Will somebody <unk> me with a <unk> ?
Will somebody hand me anything hard and <unk> to <unk> at her ?
You <unk> , you cat , you dog , you brimstone <unk> ! ” Here Mr. Smallweed , <unk> up to the highest pitch by his own eloquence , actually throws Judy at her grandmother in <unk> of anything else , by <unk> that young <unk> at the old lady with such force as he can <unk> and then <unk> into his chair in a heap .
“ <unk> me up , somebody , if you ’ ll be so good , ” says the voice from within the faintly <unk> bundle into which he has <unk> .
“ I have come to look after the property .
<unk> me up , and call in the police on duty at the next house to be explained to about the property .
My solicitor will be here presently to protect the property .
<unk> or the <unk> for anybody who shall touch the property ! ” As his dutiful <unk> set him up , panting , and putting him through the usual <unk> process of shaking and <unk> , he still repeats like an echo , “ The — the property !
The property !
<unk> ! ” Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy look at each other , the former as having <unk> the whole affair , the latter with a <unk> countenance as having entertained some lingering expectations yet .
But there is nothing to be done in opposition to the Smallweed interest .
Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s clerk comes down from his official pew in the chambers to mention to the police that Mr. Tulkinghorn is <unk> for its being all correct about the next of <unk> and that the papers and effects will be <unk> taken possession of in due time and course .
Mr. Smallweed is at once <unk> so far to <unk> his <unk> as to be carried on a visit of sentiment into the next house and upstairs into Miss Flite ’ s deserted room , where he looks like a hideous bird of prey newly added to her <unk> .
The arrival of this unexpected <unk> soon taking wind in the court still makes good for the Sol and keeps the court upon its <unk> .
Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins think it hard upon the young man if there really is no will , and consider that a handsome present ought to be made him out of the estate .
Young Piper and young Perkins , as members of that restless juvenile circle which is the terror of the <unk> in Chancery Lane , <unk> into ashes behind the <unk> and under the archway all day long , where wild <unk> and <unk> take place over their remains .
Little Swills and Miss M. <unk> enter into affable conversation with their <unk> , feeling that these unusual occurrences level the <unk> between <unk> and <unk> .
Mr. Bogsby puts up “ The popular song of King Death , with <unk> by the whole strength of the company , ” as the great Harmonic feature of the week and <unk> in the bill that “ <unk>
G. <unk> is induced to do so at a considerable extra expense in consequence of a wish which has been very generally expressed at the bar by a large body of respectable <unk> and in homage to a late melancholy event which has aroused so much sensation . ” There is one point connected with the deceased upon which the court is particularly anxious , <unk> , that the fiction of a <unk> <unk> should be preserved , though there is so little to put in it .
Upon the <unk> ’ s stating in the Sol ’ s bar in the course of the day that he has received orders to <unk> “ a <unk> , ” the general <unk> is much relieved , and it is considered that Mr. Smallweed ’ s conduct does him great honour .
Out of the court , and a long way out of it , there is considerable excitement too , for men of science and philosophy come to look , and carriages set down <unk> at the corner who <unk> with the same intent , and there is more learned talk about <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> than the court has ever <unk> .
Some of these authorities ( of course the <unk> ) hold with indignation that the deceased had no business to die in the <unk> manner ; and being reminded by other authorities of a certain inquiry into the evidence for such deaths <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ; and also of a book not quite unknown on English medical <unk> ; and likewise of the Italian case of the <unk> <unk> <unk> as set forth in detail by one <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , who wrote a <unk> work or so and was occasionally heard of in his time as having <unk> of reason in him ; and also of the testimony of Messrs. <unk> and <unk> , two <unk> <unk> who <unk> <unk> the subject ; and further , of the <unk> testimony of <unk> <unk> <unk> , a rather celebrated French surgeon once upon a time , who had the <unk> to live in a house where such a case occurred and even to write an account of it — still they regard the late Mr. Krook ’ s <unk> in going out of the world by any such <unk> as wholly <unk> and personally offensive .
The less the court <unk> of all this , the more the court likes it , and the greater enjoyment it has in the stock in trade of the Sol ’ s Arms .
Then there comes the artist of a picture newspaper , with a <unk> and figures ready drawn for anything from a <unk> on the <unk> <unk> to a <unk> in <unk> <unk> or a meeting in <unk> , and in Mrs. Perkins ’ own room , memorable evermore , he then and there throws in upon the <unk> Mr. Krook ’ s house , as large as life ; in fact , considerably larger , making a very <unk> of it .
<unk> , being <unk> to look in at the door of the fatal chamber , he <unk> that apartment as <unk> of a mile long by fifty yards high , at which the court is particularly charmed .
All this time the two gentlemen before mentioned <unk> in and out of every house and assist at the <unk> <unk> — go everywhere and listen to everybody — and yet are always <unk> into the Sol ’ s parlour and writing with the <unk> little pens on the <unk> .
At last come the coroner and his inquiry , like as before , except that the coroner <unk> this case as being out of the common way and tells the gentlemen of the jury , in his private capacity , that “ that would seem to be an <unk> house next door , gentlemen , a <unk> house ; but so we sometimes find it , and these are mysteries we can ’ t account for ! ” After which the <unk> comes into action and is much admired .
In all these proceedings Mr. Guppy has so slight a part , except when he gives his evidence , that he is moved on like a private individual and can only <unk> the secret house on the outside , where he has the <unk> of seeing Mr. Smallweed <unk> the door , and of bitterly knowing himself to be shut out .
But before these proceedings draw to a close , that is to say , on the night next after the <unk> , Mr. Guppy has a thing to say that must be said to Lady Dedlock .
For which reason , with a sinking heart and with that <unk> sense of <unk> upon him which dread and watching <unk> in the Sol ’ s Arms have produced , the young man of the name of Guppy presents himself at the town mansion at about seven o ’ clock in the evening and <unk> to see her ladyship .
Mercury replies that she is going out to dinner ; don ’ t he see the carriage at the door ?
Yes , he does see the carriage at the door ; but he wants to see my Lady too .
Mercury is disposed , as he will presently declare to a <unk> in waiting , “ to pitch into the young man ” ; but his instructions are positive .
Therefore he <unk> supposes that the young man must come up into the library .
There he leaves the young man in a large room , not <unk> , while he makes report of him .
Mr. Guppy looks into the shade in all directions , discovering everywhere a certain <unk> and whitened little heap of coal or wood .
Presently he hears a rustling .
Is it — ?
No , it ’ s no ghost , but fair flesh and blood , most <unk> dressed .
“ I have to beg your ladyship ’ s pardon , ” Mr. Guppy <unk> , very <unk> .
“ This is an inconvenient time — ” “ I told you , you could come at any time . ” She takes a chair , looking straight at him as on the last occasion .
“ Thank your ladyship .
Your ladyship is very affable . ” “ You can sit down . ” There is not much <unk> in her tone .
“ I don ’ t know , your ladyship , that it ’ s worth while my sitting down and <unk> you , for I — I have not got the letters that I mentioned when I had the honour of waiting on your ladyship . ” “ Have you come merely to say so ? ” “ <unk> to say so , your ladyship . ” Mr. Guppy besides being depressed , disappointed , and uneasy , is put at a further disadvantage by the splendour and beauty of her appearance .
She knows its influence perfectly , has <unk> it too well to miss a <unk> of its effect on any one .
As she looks at him so steadily and <unk> , he not only feels conscious that he has no guide in the least perception of what is really the complexion of her thoughts , but also that he is being every moment , as it were , removed further and further from her .
She will not speak , it is plain .
So he must .
“ In short , your ladyship , ” says Mr. Guppy like a <unk> <unk> <unk> , “ the person I was to have had the letters of , has come to a sudden end , and — ” He stops .
Lady Dedlock calmly <unk> the sentence .
“ And the letters are destroyed with the person ? ” Mr. Guppy would say no if he could — as he is unable to hide .
“ I believe so , your ladyship . ” If he could see the least <unk> of relief in her face now ?
No , he could see no such thing , even if that brave outside did not utterly put him away , and he were not looking beyond it and about it .
He falters an awkward excuse or two for his failure .
“ Is this all you have to say ? ” inquires Lady Dedlock , having heard him out — or as nearly out as he can <unk> .
Mr. Guppy thinks that ’ s all .
“ You had better be sure that you wish to say nothing more to me , this being the last time you will have the opportunity . ” Mr. Guppy is quite sure .
And indeed he has no such wish at present , by any means .
“ That is enough .
I will dispense with <unk> .
Good evening to you ! ” And she rings for Mercury to show the young man of the name of Guppy out .
But in that house , in that same moment , there happens to be an old man of the name of Tulkinghorn .
And that old man , coming with his quiet <unk> to the library , has his hand at that moment on the handle of the door — comes in — and comes face to face with the young man as he is leaving the room .
One glance between the old man and the lady , and for an instant the blind that is always down flies up .
<unk> , eager and sharp , looks out .
Another instant , close again .
“ I beg your pardon , Lady Dedlock .
I beg your pardon a thousand times .
It is so very unusual to find you here at this hour .
I supposed the room was empty .
I beg your pardon ! ” “ <unk> ! ” She <unk> calls him back .
“ <unk> here , I beg .
I am going out to dinner .
I have nothing more to say to this young man ! ” The disconcerted young man bows , as he goes out , and <unk> hopes that Mr. Tulkinghorn of the Fields is well .
“ Aye , aye ? ” says the lawyer , looking at him from under his bent <unk> , though he has no need to look again — not he .
“ From Kenge and Carboy ’ s , surely ? ” “ Kenge and Carboy ’ s , Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Name of Guppy , sir . ” “ To be sure .
Why , thank you , Mr. Guppy , I am very well ! ” “ <unk> to hear it , sir .
You can ’ t be too well , sir , for the credit of the profession . ” “ Thank you , Mr. Guppy ! ” Mr. Guppy <unk> away .
Mr. Tulkinghorn , such a <unk> in his old-fashioned rusty black to Lady Dedlock ’ s brightness , hands her down the staircase to her carriage .
He returns rubbing his chin , and rubs it a good deal in the course of the evening .
CHAPTER <unk> A <unk> of the <unk> “ Now , what , ” says Mr. George , “ may this be ?
Is it blank <unk> or ball ?
A <unk> in the <unk> or a shot ? ” An open letter is the subject of the trooper ’ s <unk> , and it seems to <unk> him <unk> .
He looks at it at arm ’ s length , brings it close to him , holds it in his right hand , holds it in his left hand , reads it with his head on this side , with his head on that side , <unk> his eyebrows , <unk> them , still cannot satisfy himself .
He <unk> it out upon the table with his heavy palm , and thoughtfully walking up and down the gallery , makes a <unk> before it every now and then to come upon it with a fresh eye .
Even that won ’ t do .
“ Is it , ” Mr. George still <unk> , “ blank <unk> or ball ? ” Phil Squod , with the aid of a brush and <unk> , is employed in the distance <unk> the <unk> , softly <unk> in <unk> time and in <unk> manner that he must and will go back again to the girl he left behind him .
“ Phil ! ” The trooper beckons as he calls him .
Phil <unk> in his usual way , <unk> off at first as if he were going anywhere else and then bearing down upon his commander like a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of white show in high relief upon his dirty face , and he <unk> his one eyebrow with the handle of the brush .
“ <unk> , Phil !
Listen to this . ” “ <unk> , commander , steady . ” “ ‘ Sir .
<unk> me to remind you ( though there is no legal necessity for my doing so , as you are aware ) that the bill at two months ’ date drawn on yourself by Mr. Matthew Bagnet , and by you accepted , for the sum of <unk> pounds four shillings and <unk> , will become due to-morrow , when you will please be prepared to take up the same on <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> Smallweed . ’ What do you make of that , Phil ? ” “ <unk> , guv ’ ner . ” “ Why ? ” “ I think , ” replies Phil after <unk> <unk> out a <unk> in his forehead with the <unk> , “ that <unk> consequences is always meant when money ’ s asked for . ” “ <unk> , Phil , ” says the trooper , sitting on the table .
“ First and last , I have paid , I may say , half as much again as this principal in interest and one thing and another . ” Phil <unk> by <unk> back a pace or two , with a very unaccountable <unk> of his <unk> face , that he does not regard the transaction as being made more promising by this <unk> .
“ And <unk> further , Phil , ” says the trooper , staying his <unk> <unk> with a wave of his hand .
“ There has always been an understanding that this bill was to be what they call renewed .
And it has been renewed no end of times .
What do you say now ? ” “ I say that I think the times is come to a end at last . ” “ You do ?
<unk> !
I am much of the same mind myself . ” “ <unk> Smallweed is him that was brought here in a chair ? ” “ The same . ” “ <unk> ’ ner , ” says Phil with <unk> gravity , “ he ’ s a <unk> in his <unk> , he ’ s a <unk> and a <unk> in his actions , a <unk> in his <unk> , and a <unk> in his <unk> . ” Having thus <unk> uttered his sentiments , Mr. Squod , after waiting a little to <unk> if any further remark be expected of him , gets back by his usual series of movements to the <unk> he has in hand and <unk> <unk> through his former musical medium that he must and he will return to that <unk> young lady .
George , having folded the letter , walks in that direction .
“ There IS a way , commander , ” says Phil , looking <unk> at him , “ of <unk> this . ” “ <unk> the money , I suppose ?
I wish I could . ” Phil shakes his head .
“ No , guv ’ ner , no ; not so bad as that .
There IS a way , ” says Phil with a highly <unk> turn of his brush ; “ what I ’ m <unk> at present . ” “ <unk> . ” Phil nods .
“ A pretty way that would be !
Do you know what would become of the <unk> in that case ?
Do you know they would be ruined to pay off my old scores ?
YOU ’ <unk> a moral character , ” says the trooper , eyeing him in his large way with no small indignation ; “ upon my life you are , Phil ! ” Phil , on one knee at the <unk> , is in course of protesting earnestly , though not without many <unk> <unk> of his brush and <unk> of the white surface round the <unk> with his <unk> , that he had forgotten the Bagnet responsibility and would not so much as <unk> a hair of the head of any member of that worthy family when steps are audible in the long passage without , and a cheerful voice is heard to wonder whether George is at home .
Phil , with a look at his master , <unk> up , saying , “ Here ’ s the guv ’ ner , Mrs. Bagnet !
Here he is ! ” and the old girl herself , accompanied by Mr. Bagnet , appears .
The old girl never appears in walking <unk> , in any season of the year , without a grey cloth cloak , coarse and much worn but very clean , which is , undoubtedly , the <unk> <unk> rendered so interesting to Mr. Bagnet by having made its way home to Europe from another quarter of the <unk> in company with Mrs. Bagnet and an umbrella .
The latter faithful <unk> is also invariably a part of the old girl ’ s presence out of doors .
It is of no colour known in this life and has a <unk> wooden crook for a handle , with a <unk> object let into its <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> a little model of a <unk> over a street door or one of the <unk> glasses out of a pair of spectacles , which <unk> object has not that <unk> capacity of sticking to its post that might be desired in an article long associated with the British army .
The old girl ’ s umbrella is of a <unk> habit of waist and seems to be in need of <unk> — an appearance that is possibly <unk> to its having served through a series of years at home as a cupboard and on <unk> as a carpet bag .
She never puts it up , having the greatest reliance on her <unk> cloak with its <unk> <unk> , but generally uses the instrument as a <unk> with which to point out <unk> of <unk> or <unk> of greens in <unk> or to <unk> the attention of <unk> by a friendly poke .
Without her <unk> , which is a sort of <unk> well with two <unk> <unk> , she never stirs abroad .
<unk> by these her <unk> companions , therefore , her honest sunburnt face looking <unk> out of a rough straw bonnet , Mrs. Bagnet now arrives , <unk> and bright , in George ’ s Shooting Gallery .
“ Well , George , old fellow , ” says she , “ and how do YOU do , this <unk> morning ? ” <unk> him a friendly shake of the hand , Mrs. Bagnet draws a long breath after her walk and sits down to enjoy a rest .
Having a <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> and in other such <unk> , of resting easily anywhere , she <unk> on a rough bench , <unk> her <unk> , <unk> back her bonnet , crosses her arms , and looks perfectly comfortable .
Mr. Bagnet in the meantime has shaken hands with his old comrade and with Phil , on whom Mrs. Bagnet likewise <unk> a good-humoured nod and smile .
“ Now , George , ” said Mrs. Bagnet <unk> , “ here we are , Lignum and myself ” — she often speaks of her husband by this <unk> , on account , as it is supposed , of Lignum <unk> having been his old <unk> <unk> when they first became acquainted , in compliment to the extreme <unk> and <unk> of his <unk> — “ just looked in , we have , to make it all correct as usual about that security .
Give him the new bill to sign , George , and he ’ ll sign it like a man . ” “ I was coming to you this morning , ” observes the trooper <unk> .
“ Yes , we thought you ’ d come to us this morning , but we turned out early and left Woolwich , the best of boys , to mind his sisters and came to you instead — as you see !
For Lignum , he ’ s tied so close now , and gets so little exercise , that a walk does him good .
But what ’ s the matter , George ? ” asks Mrs. Bagnet , stopping in her cheerful talk .
“ You don ’ t look yourself . ” “ I am not quite myself , ” returns the trooper ; “ I have been a little put out , Mrs. Bagnet . ” Her bright quick eye catches the truth directly .
“ George ! ” holding up her forefinger .
“ Don ’ t tell me there ’ s anything wrong about that security of Lignum ’ s !
Don ’ t do it , George , on account of the children ! ” The trooper looks at her with a troubled <unk> .
“ George , ” says Mrs. Bagnet , using both her arms for emphasis and occasionally bringing down her open hands upon her knees .
“ If you have allowed anything wrong to come to that security of Lignum ’ s , and if you have let him in for it , and if you have put us in danger of being sold up — and I see sold up in your face , George , as plain as print — you have done a <unk> action and have <unk> us <unk> .
I tell you , <unk> , George .
There ! ” Mr. Bagnet , otherwise as immovable as a <unk> or a <unk> , puts his large right hand on the top of his bald head as if to defend it from a <unk> and looks with great uneasiness at Mrs. Bagnet .
“ George , ” says that old girl , “ I wonder at you !
George , I am ashamed of you !
George , I couldn ’ t have believed you would have done it !
I always knew you to be a rolling stone that gathered no moss , but I never thought you would have taken away what little moss there was for Bagnet and the children to lie upon .
You know what a <unk> , <unk> chap he is .
You know what Quebec and Malta and Woolwich are , and I never did think you would , or could , have had the heart to serve us so .
Oh , George ! ” Mrs. Bagnet <unk> up her cloak to <unk> her eyes on in a very genuine manner , “ How could you do it ? ” Mrs. Bagnet <unk> , Mr. Bagnet <unk> his hand from his head as if the <unk> were over and looks <unk> at Mr. George , who has turned quite white and looks <unk> at the grey cloak and straw bonnet .
“ Mat , ” says the trooper in a subdued voice , addressing him but still looking at his wife , “ I am sorry you take it so much to heart , because I do hope it ’ s not so bad as that comes to .
I certainly have , this morning , received this letter ” — which he reads aloud — “ but I hope it may be set right yet .
As to a rolling stone , why , what you say is true .
I AM a rolling stone , and I never rolled in anybody ’ s way , I fully believe , that I rolled the least good to .
But it ’ s impossible for an old vagabond comrade to like your wife and family better than I like ’ em , Mat , and I trust you ’ ll look upon me as <unk> as you can .
Don ’ t think I ’ ve kept anything from you .
I haven ’ t had the letter more than a quarter of an hour . ” “ Old girl , ” murmurs Mr. Bagnet after a short silence , “ will you tell him my opinion ? ” “ Oh !
Why didn ’ t he marry , ” Mrs. Bagnet answers , half laughing and half crying , “ <unk> <unk> ’ s <unk> in North America ?
Then he wouldn ’ t have got himself into these <unk> . ” “ The old girl , ” says Mr. Bagnet , “ puts it correct — why didn ’ t you ? ” “ Well , she has a better husband by this time , I hope , ” returns the trooper .
“ <unk> , here I stand , this present day , NOT married to <unk> <unk> ’ s <unk> .
What shall I do ?
You see all I have got about me .
It ’ s not mine ; it ’ s yours .
Give the word , and I ’ ll sell off every morsel .
If I could have hoped it would have brought in nearly the sum wanted , I ’ d have sold all long ago .
Don ’ t believe that I ’ ll leave you or yours in the <unk> , Mat .
I ’ d sell myself first .
I only wish , ” says the trooper , giving himself a <unk> blow in the chest , “ that I knew of any one who ’ d buy such a second-hand piece of old <unk> . ” “ Old girl , ” murmurs Mr. Bagnet , “ give him another bit of my mind . ” “ George , ” says the old girl , “ you are not so much to be <unk> , on full consideration , except for ever taking this business without the means . ” “ And that was like me ! ” observes the <unk> trooper , shaking his head .
“ Like me , I know . ” “ <unk> !
The old girl , ” says Mr. Bagnet , “ is correct — in her way of giving my opinions — hear me out ! ” “ That was when you never ought to have asked for the security , George , and when you never ought to have got it , all things considered .
But what ’ s done can ’ t be undone .
You are always an honourable and <unk> fellow , as far as lays in your power , though a little <unk> .
On the other hand , you can ’ t admit but what it ’ s natural in us to be anxious with such a thing hanging over our heads .
So forget and forgive all round , George .
Come !
<unk> and forgive all round ! ” Mrs. Bagnet , giving him one of her honest hands and giving her husband the other , Mr. George gives each of them one of his and holds them while he speaks .
“ I do assure you both , there ’ s nothing I wouldn ’ t do to discharge this obligation .
But whatever I have been able to scrape together has gone every two months in keeping it up .
We have lived plainly enough here , Phil and I.
But the gallery don ’ t quite do what was expected of it , and it ’ s not — in short , it ’ s not the <unk> .
It was wrong in me to take it ?
Well , so it was .
But I was in a manner drawn into that step , and I thought it might steady me , and set me up , and you ’ ll try to <unk> my having such expectations , and upon my soul , I am very much obliged to you , and very much ashamed of myself . ” With these <unk> words , Mr. George gives a shake to each of the hands he holds , and <unk> them , backs a pace or two in a <unk> , upright attitude , as if he had made a final <unk> and were immediately going to be shot with all military <unk> .
“ George , hear me out ! ” says Mr. Bagnet , glancing at his wife .
“ Old girl , go on ! ” Mr. Bagnet , being in this singular manner heard out , has merely to observe that the letter must be attended to without any delay , that it is <unk> that George and he should immediately wait on Mr. Smallweed in person , and that the <unk> object is to save and hold harmless Mr. Bagnet , who had none of the money .
Mr. George , entirely <unk> , puts on his hat and prepares to march with Mr. Bagnet to the enemy ’ s <unk> .
“ Don ’ t you mind a woman ’ s hasty word , George , ” says Mrs. Bagnet , <unk> him on the shoulder .
“ I trust my old Lignum to you , and I am sure you ’ ll bring him through it . ” The trooper returns that this is kindly said and that he WILL bring Lignum through it somehow .
Upon which Mrs. Bagnet , with her cloak , basket , and umbrella , goes home , bright-eyed again , to the rest of her family , and the <unk> <unk> forth on the hopeful errand of <unk> Mr. Smallweed .
Whether there are two people in England less likely to come <unk> out of any <unk> with Mr. Smallweed than Mr. George and Mr. Matthew Bagnet may be very <unk> <unk> .
Also , notwithstanding their martial appearance , broad square shoulders , and heavy tread , whether there are within the same limits two more simple and <unk> children in all the <unk> affairs of life .
As they proceed with great gravity through the streets towards the region of <unk> Pleasant , Mr. Bagnet , observing his companion to be thoughtful , considers it a friendly part to refer to Mrs. Bagnet ’ s late <unk> .
“ George , you know the old girl — she ’ s as sweet and as mild as milk .
But touch her on the children — or myself — and she ’ s off like gunpowder . ” “ It does her credit , Mat ! ” “ George , ” says Mr. Bagnet , looking straight before him , “ the old girl — can ’ t do anything — that don ’ t do her credit .
More or less .
I never say so .
Discipline must be maintained . ” “ She ’ s worth her weight in gold , ” says the trooper .
“ In gold ? ” says Mr. Bagnet .
“ I ’ ll tell you what .
The old girl ’ s weight — is twelve stone six .
Would I take that weight — in any metal — for the old girl ?
No .
Why not ?
Because the old girl ’ s metal is far more precious — than the <unk> metal .
And she ’ s <unk> metal ! ” “ You are right , Mat ! ” “ When she took me — and accepted of the ring — she ’ <unk> under me and the children — heart and head ; for life .
She ’ s that earnest , ” says Mr. Bagnet , “ and true to her colours — that , touch us with a finger — and she turns out — and stands to her arms .
If the old girl fires wide — once in a way — at the call of duty — look over it , George .
For she ’ s <unk> ! ” “ Why , bless her , Mat , ” returns the trooper , “ I think the higher of her for it ! ” “ You are right ! ” says Mr. Bagnet with the <unk> enthusiasm , though without <unk> the <unk> of a single <unk> .
“ Think as high of the old girl — as the rock of <unk> — and still you ’ ll be thinking low — of such merits .
But I never own to it before her .
Discipline must be maintained . ” These <unk> bring them to <unk> Pleasant and to Grandfather Smallweed ’ s house .
The door is opened by the <unk> Judy , who , having <unk> them from top to <unk> with no particular favour , but indeed with a <unk> <unk> , leaves them standing there while she <unk> the <unk> as to their admission .
The <unk> may be <unk> to give consent from the circumstance of her returning with the words on her honey lips that they can come in if they want to it .
Thus <unk> , they come in and find Mr. Smallweed with his feet in the drawer of his chair as if it were a paper <unk> and Mrs. Smallweed <unk> with the cushion like a bird that is not to sing .
“ My dear friend , ” says Grandfather Smallweed with those two lean affectionate arms of his stretched forth .
“ How de do ?
How de do ?
Who is our friend , my dear friend ? ” “ Why this , ” returns George , not able to be very <unk> at first , “ is Matthew Bagnet , who has obliged me in that matter of ours , you know . ” “ Oh !
Mr. Bagnet ?
Surely ! ” The old man looks at him under his hand .
“ <unk> you ’ re well , Mr. Bagnet ?
<unk> man , Mr. George !
<unk> air , sir ! ” No chairs being offered , Mr. George brings one forward for Bagnet and one for himself .
They sit down , Mr. Bagnet as if he had no power of bending himself , except at the <unk> , for that purpose .
“ Judy , ” says Mr. Smallweed , “ bring the pipe . ” “ Why , I don ’ t know , ” Mr. George interposes , “ that the young woman need give herself that trouble , for to tell you the truth , I am not inclined to smoke it to-day . ” “ Ain ’ t you ? ” returns the old man .
“ Judy , bring the pipe . ” “ The fact is , Mr. Smallweed , ” proceeds George , “ that I find myself in rather an unpleasant state of mind .
It appears to me , sir , that your friend in the city has been playing <unk> . ” “ Oh , dear no ! ” says Grandfather Smallweed .
“ He never does that ! ” “ Don ’ t he ?
Well , I am glad to hear it , because I thought it might be HIS doing .
This , you know , I am speaking of .
This letter . ” Grandfather Smallweed smiles in a very ugly way in recognition of the letter .
“ What does it mean ? ” asks Mr. George .
“ Judy , ” says the old man .
“ Have you got the pipe ?
Give it to me .
Did you say what does it mean , my good friend ? ” “ Aye !
Now , come , come , you know , Mr. Smallweed , ” <unk> the trooper , <unk> himself to speak as smoothly and confidentially as he can , holding the open letter in one hand and resting the broad knuckles of the other on his <unk> , “ a good lot of money has passed between us , and we are face to face at the present moment , and are both well aware of the understanding there has always been .
I am prepared to do the usual thing which I have done regularly and to keep this matter going .
I never got a letter like this from you before , and I have been a little put about by it this morning , because here ’ s my friend Matthew Bagnet , who , you know , had none of the money — ” “ I DON ’ T know it , you know , ” says the old man quietly .
“ Why , <unk> you — it , I mean — I tell you so , don ’ t I ? ” “ Oh , yes , you tell me so , ” returns Grandfather Smallweed .
“ But I don ’ t know it . ” “ Well ! ” says the trooper , <unk> his fire .
“ I know it . ” Mr. Smallweed replies with excellent temper , “ Ah !
That ’ s quite another thing ! ” And adds , “ But it don ’ t matter .
Mr. Bagnet ’ s situation is all one , whether or no . ” The unfortunate George makes a great effort to arrange the affair comfortably and to <unk> Mr. Smallweed by taking him upon his own terms .
“ That ’ s just what I mean .
As you say , Mr. Smallweed , here ’ s Matthew Bagnet liable to be fixed whether or no .
Now , you see , that makes his good lady very uneasy in her mind , and me too , for <unk> I ’ m a <unk> sort of a <unk> that more <unk> than halfpence come natural to , why he ’ s a steady family man , don ’ t you see ?
Now , Mr. Smallweed , ” says the trooper , <unk> confidence as he proceeds in his soldierly mode of doing business , “ although you and I are good friends enough in a certain sort of a way , I am well aware that I can ’ t ask you to let my friend Bagnet off entirely . ” “ Oh , dear , you are too modest .
You can <unk> me anything , Mr. George . ” ( There is an <unk> kind of <unk> in Grandfather Smallweed to-day . )
“ And you can refuse , you mean , eh ?
Or not you so much , perhaps , as your friend in the city ?
Ha ha ha ! ” “ Ha ha ha ! ” <unk> Grandfather Smallweed .
In such a very hard manner and with eyes so particularly green that Mr. Bagnet ’ s natural gravity is much <unk> by the contemplation of that venerable man .
“ Come ! ” says the sanguine George .
“ I am glad to find we can be pleasant , because I want to arrange this pleasantly .
Here ’ s my friend Bagnet , and here am I. We ’ ll settle the matter on the spot , if you please , Mr. Smallweed , in the usual way .
And you ’ ll ease my friend Bagnet ’ s mind , and his family ’ s mind , a good deal if you ’ ll just mention to him what our understanding is . ” Here some shrill <unk> cries out in a <unk> manner , “ Oh , good gracious !
Oh ! ” Unless , indeed , it be the <unk> Judy , who is found to be silent when the startled visitors look round , but whose chin has received a <unk> <unk> , expressive of <unk> and contempt .
Mr. Bagnet ’ s gravity becomes yet more profound .
“ But I think you asked me , Mr. George ” — old Smallweed , who all this time has had the pipe in his hand , is the <unk> now — “ I think you asked me , what did the letter mean ? ” “ Why , yes , I did , ” returns the trooper in his off-hand way , “ but I don ’ t care to know particularly , if it ’ s all correct and pleasant . ” Mr. Smallweed , purposely <unk> himself in an <unk> at the trooper ’ s head , throws the pipe on the ground and breaks it to pieces .
“ That ’ s what it means , my dear friend .
I ’ ll <unk> you .
I ’ ll <unk> you .
I ’ ll powder you .
Go to the devil ! ” The two friends rise and look at one another .
Mr. Bagnet ’ s gravity has now <unk> its <unk> point .
“ Go to the devil ! ” repeats the old man .
“ I ’ ll have no more of your <unk> and <unk> .
What ?
You ’ re an <unk> <unk> , too !
Go to my lawyer ( you remember where ; you have been there before ) and show your independence now , will you ?
Come , my dear friend , there ’ s a chance for you .
<unk> the street door , Judy ; put these <unk> out !
Call in help if they don ’ t go .
Put ’ em out ! ” He <unk> this so <unk> that Mr. Bagnet , laying his hands on the shoulders of his comrade before the latter can recover from his amazement , gets him on the outside of the street door , which is instantly <unk> by the triumphant Judy .
<unk> <unk> , Mr. George <unk> stands looking at the <unk> .
Mr. Bagnet , in a perfect <unk> of gravity , walks up and down before the little parlour window like a <unk> and looks in every time he passes , apparently revolving something in his mind .
“ Come , Mat , ” says Mr. George when he has recovered himself , “ we must try the lawyer .
Now , what do you think of this <unk> ? ” Mr. Bagnet , stopping to take a farewell look into the parlour , replies with one shake of his head directed at the <unk> , “ If my old girl had been here — I ’ d have told him ! ” Having so discharged himself of the subject of his <unk> , he falls into step and marches off with the trooper , shoulder to shoulder .
When they present themselves in Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields , Mr. Tulkinghorn is engaged and not to be seen .
He is not at all willing to see them , for when they have waited a full hour , and the clerk , on his bell being rung , takes the opportunity of mentioning as much , he brings forth no more encouraging message than that Mr. Tulkinghorn has nothing to say to them and they had better not wait .
They do wait , however , with the perseverance of military <unk> , and at last the bell rings again and the client in possession comes out of Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s room .
The client is a handsome old lady , no other than Mrs. Rouncewell , housekeeper at Chesney Wold .
She comes out of the sanctuary with a fair old-fashioned curtsy and softly shuts the door .
She is treated with some distinction there , for the clerk steps out of his pew to show her through the outer office and to let her out .
The old lady is thanking him for his attention when she observes the <unk> in waiting .
“ I beg your pardon , sir , but I think those gentlemen are military ? ” The clerk referring the question to them with his eye , and Mr. George not turning round from the <unk> over the fire-place .
Mr. Bagnet takes upon himself to reply , “ Yes , ma ’ am .
<unk> . ” “ I thought so .
I was sure of it .
My heart <unk> , gentlemen , at the sight of you .
It always does at the sight of such .
God bless you , gentlemen !
You ’ ll excuse an old woman , but I had a son once who went for a soldier .
A fine handsome youth he was , and good in his bold way , though some people did disparage him to his poor mother .
I ask your pardon for <unk> you , sir .
God bless you , gentlemen ! ” “ <unk> to you , ma ’ am ! ” returns Mr. Bagnet with right good will .
There is something very touching in the earnestness of the old lady ’ s voice and in the tremble that goes through her <unk> old figure .
But Mr. George is so occupied with the <unk> over the fire-place ( <unk> the coming months by it perhaps ) that he does not look round until she has gone away and the door is closed upon her .
“ George , ” Mr. Bagnet <unk> whispers when he does turn from the <unk> at last .
“ Don ’ t be cast down !
‘ Why , <unk> , why — should we be melancholy , boys ? ’ <unk> up , my hearty ! ” The clerk having now again gone in to say that they are still there and Mr. Tulkinghorn being heard to return with some <unk> , “ Let ’ em come in then ! ” they pass into the great room with the painted ceiling and find him standing before the fire .
“ Now , you men , what do you want ?
Sergeant , I told you the last time I saw you that I don ’ t desire your company here . ” Sergeant replies — dashed within the last few minutes as to his usual manner of speech , and even as to his usual carriage — that he has received this letter , has been to Mr. Smallweed about it , and has been referred there .
“ I have nothing to say to you , ” rejoins Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ If you get into debt , you must pay your <unk> or take the consequences .
You have no occasion to come here to learn that , I suppose ? ” Sergeant is sorry to say that he is not prepared with the money .
“ Very well !
Then the other man — this man , if this is he — must pay it for you . ” Sergeant is sorry to add that the other man is not prepared with the money either .
“ Very well !
Then you must pay it between you or you must both be <unk> for it and both suffer .
You have had the money and must refund it .
You are not to pocket other people ’ s pounds , shillings , and <unk> and escape <unk> . ” The lawyer sits down in his easy-chair and stirs the fire .
Mr. George hopes he will have the goodness to — “ I tell you , sergeant , I have nothing to say to you .
I don ’ t like your <unk> and don ’ t want you here .
This matter is not at all in my course of practice and is not in my office .
Mr. Smallweed is good enough to offer these affairs to me , but they are not in my way .
You must go to <unk> ’ s in <unk> ’ s Inn . ” “ I must make an apology to you , sir , ” says Mr. George , “ for pressing myself upon you with so little encouragement — which is almost as unpleasant to me as it can be to you — but would you let me say a private word to you ? ” Mr. Tulkinghorn rises with his hands in his pockets and walks into one of the window <unk> .
“ Now !
I have no time to waste . ” In the midst of his perfect <unk> of indifference , he directs a sharp look at the trooper , taking care to stand with his own back to the light and to have the other with his face towards it .
“ Well , sir , ” says Mr. George , “ this man with me is the other party <unk> in this unfortunate affair — <unk> , only <unk> — and my sole object is to prevent his getting into trouble on my account .
He is a most respectable man with a wife and family , formerly in the Royal <unk> — ” “ My friend , I don ’ t care a pinch of snuff for the whole Royal <unk> establishment — officers , men , <unk> , <unk> , horses , guns , and <unk> . ” “ ’ Tis likely , sir .
But I care a good deal for Bagnet and his wife and family being injured on my account .
And if I could bring them through this matter , I should have no help for it but to give up without any other consideration what you wanted of me the other day . ” “ Have you got it here ? ” “ I have got it here , sir . ” “ Sergeant , ” the lawyer proceeds in his dry <unk> manner , far more hopeless in the dealing with than any amount of vehemence , “ make up your mind while I speak to you , for this is final .
After I have finished speaking I have closed the subject , and I won ’ t <unk> it .
<unk> that .
You can leave here , for a few days , what you say you have brought here if you choose ; you can take it away at once if you choose .
In case you choose to leave it here , I can do this for you — I can <unk> this matter on its old footing , and I can go so far besides as to give you a written undertaking that this man Bagnet shall never be troubled in any way until you have been proceeded against to the utmost , that your means shall be exhausted before the <unk> looks to his .
This is in fact all but <unk> him .
Have you decided ? ” The trooper puts his hand into his breast and answers with a long breath , “ I must do it , sir . ” So Mr. Tulkinghorn , putting on his spectacles , sits down and writes the undertaking , which he slowly reads and explains to Bagnet , who has all this time been staring at the ceiling and who puts his hand on his bald head again , under this new <unk> <unk> , and seems exceedingly in need of the old girl through whom to express his sentiments .
The trooper then takes from his <unk> a folded paper , which he lays with an unwilling hand at the lawyer ’ s elbow .
“ ’ Tis only a letter of instructions , sir .
The last I ever had from him . ” Look at a <unk> , Mr. George , for some change in its expression , and you will find it quite as soon as in the face of Mr. Tulkinghorn when he opens and reads the letter !
He <unk> it and lays it in his desk with a countenance as <unk> as death .
Nor has he anything more to say or do but to nod once in the same <unk> and <unk> manner and to say briefly , “ You can go .
<unk> these men out , there ! ” Being shown out , they repair to Mr. Bagnet ’ s residence to dine .
<unk> <unk> and greens <unk> the day ’ s variety on the former <unk> of <unk> pork and greens , and Mrs. Bagnet <unk> out the meal in the same way and seasons it with the best of temper , being that rare sort of old girl that she receives Good to her arms without a hint that it might be Better and catches light from any little spot of darkness near her .
The spot on this occasion is the darkened brow of Mr. George ; he is <unk> thoughtful and depressed .
At first Mrs. Bagnet trusts to the combined <unk> of Quebec and Malta to restore him , but finding those young ladies sensible that their <unk> Bluffy is not the Bluffy of their usual <unk> acquaintance , she winks off the light <unk> and leaves him to <unk> at leisure on the open ground of the domestic hearth .
But he does not .
He remains in close order , <unk> and depressed .
During the <unk> <unk> up and <unk> process , when he and Mr. Bagnet are <unk> with their pipes , he is no better than he was at dinner .
He <unk> to smoke , looks at the fire and <unk> , lets his pipe out , fills the breast of Mr. Bagnet with <unk> and <unk> by showing that he has no enjoyment of tobacco .
Therefore when Mrs. Bagnet at last appears , rosy from the <unk> <unk> , and sits down to her work , Mr. Bagnet <unk> , “ Old girl ! ” and winks <unk> to her to find out what ’ s the matter .
“ Why , George ! ” says Mrs. Bagnet , quietly <unk> her needle .
“ How low you are ! ” “ Am I ?
Not good company ?
Well , I am afraid I am not . ” “ He ain ’ t at all like Bluffy , mother ! ” cries little Malta .
“ Because he ain ’ t well , I think , mother , ” adds Quebec .
“ <unk> that ’ s a bad sign not to be like Bluffy , too ! ” returns the trooper , kissing the young <unk> .
“ But it ’ s true , ” with a sigh , “ true , I am afraid .
These little ones are always right ! ” “ George , ” says Mrs. Bagnet , working busily , “ if I thought you cross enough to think of anything that a shrill old soldier ’ s wife — who could have <unk> her tongue off afterwards and ought to have done it almost — said this morning , I don ’ t know what I shouldn ’ t say to you now . ” “ My kind soul of a darling , ” returns the trooper .
“ Not a morsel of it . ” “ Because really and truly , George , what I said and meant to say was that I trusted Lignum to you and was sure you ’ d bring him through it .
And you HAVE brought him through it , noble ! ” “ Thankee , my dear ! ” says George .
“ I am glad of your good opinion . ” In giving Mrs. Bagnet ’ s hand , with her work in it , a friendly shake — for she took her seat beside him — the trooper ’ s attention is attracted to her face .
After looking at it for a little while as she <unk> her needle , he looks to young Woolwich , sitting on his stool in the corner , and beckons that <unk> to him .
“ See there , my boy , ” says George , very gently smoothing the mother ’ s hair with his hand , “ there ’ s a good loving forehead for you !
All bright with love of you , my boy .
A little touched by the sun and the weather through following your father about and taking care of you , but as fresh and wholesome as a <unk> <unk> on a tree . ” Mr. Bagnet ’ s face expresses , so far as in its wooden material lies , the highest <unk> and <unk> .
“ The time will come , my boy , ” pursues the trooper , “ when this hair of your mother ’ s will be grey , and this forehead all crossed and <unk> with <unk> , and a fine old lady she ’ ll be then .
Take care , while you are young , that you can think in those days , ‘ I never whitened a hair of her dear head — I never marked a sorrowful line in her face ! ’ For of all the many things that you can think of when you are a man , you had better have THAT by you , Woolwich ! ” Mr. George concludes by rising from his chair , <unk> the boy beside his mother in it , and saying , with something of a hurry about him , that he ’ ll smoke his pipe in the street a bit .
CHAPTER <unk> Esther ’ s Narrative I lay ill through several weeks , and the usual <unk> of my life became like an old remembrance .
But this was not the effect of time so much as of the change in all my habits made by the <unk> and <unk> of a <unk> .
Before I had been confined to it many days , everything else seemed to have retired into a remote distance where there was little or no separation between the various <unk> of my life which had been really divided by years .
In falling ill , I seemed to have crossed a dark <unk> and to have left all my experiences , mingled together by the great distance , on the healthy shore .
My housekeeping duties , though at first it caused me great anxiety to think that they were <unk> , were soon as far off as the oldest of the old duties at Greenleaf or the summer <unk> when I went home from school with my <unk> under my arm , and my childish shadow at my side , to my godmother ’ s house .
I had never known before how short life really was and into how small a space the mind could put it .
While I was very ill , the way in which these <unk> of time became confused with one another distressed my mind exceedingly .
At once a child , an elder girl , and the little woman I had been so happy as , I was not only <unk> by cares and difficulties adapted to each station , but by the great perplexity of <unk> trying to <unk> them .
I suppose that few who have not been in such a condition can quite understand what I mean or what painful <unk> arose from this source .
For the same reason I am almost afraid to hint at that time in my disorder — it seemed one long night , but I believe there were both nights and days in it — when I laboured up <unk> staircases , ever striving to reach the top , and ever turned , as I have seen a <unk> in a garden path , by some <unk> , and labouring again .
I knew perfectly at intervals , and I think <unk> at most times , that I was in my bed ; and I talked with Charley , and felt her touch , and knew her very well ; yet I would find myself <unk> , “ Oh , more of these <unk> stairs , Charley — more and more — <unk> up to the sky ’ , I think ! ” and labouring on again .
<unk> I hint at that worse time when , <unk> together somewhere in great black space , there was a <unk> necklace , or ring , or <unk> circle of some kind , of which I was one of the <unk> !
And when my only prayer was to be taken off from the rest and when it was such <unk> agony and misery to be a part of the dreadful thing ?
Perhaps the less I say of these sick experiences , the less <unk> and the more <unk> I shall be .
I do not recall them to make others unhappy or because I am now the least unhappy in remembering them .
It may be that if we knew more of such strange <unk> we might be the better able to <unk> their <unk> .
The repose that succeeded , the long delicious sleep , the <unk> rest , when in my weakness I was too calm to have any care for myself and could have heard ( or so I think now ) that I was dying , with no other emotion than with a <unk> love for those I left behind — this state can be perhaps more <unk> understood .
I was in this state when I first <unk> from the light as it <unk> on me once more , and knew with a <unk> joy for which no words are <unk> enough that I should see again .
I had heard my Ada crying at the door , day and night ; I had heard her calling to me that I was cruel and did not love her ; I had heard her <unk> and imploring to be let in to nurse and comfort me and to leave my bedside no more ; but I had only said , when I could speak , “ Never , my sweet girl , never ! ” and I had over and over again reminded Charley that she was to keep my darling from the room whether I lived or died .
Charley had been true to me in that time of need , and with her little hand and her great heart had kept the door fast .
But now , my sight strengthening and the glorious light coming every day more fully and brightly on me , I could read the letters that my dear wrote to me every morning and evening and could put them to my lips and lay my cheek upon them with no fear of hurting her .
I could see my little maid , so tender and so careful , going about the two rooms setting everything in order and speaking cheerfully to Ada from the open window again .
I could understand the stillness in the house and the <unk> it expressed on the part of all those who had always been so good to me .
I could <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of my heart and be as happy in my weakness as ever I had been in my strength .
By and by my strength began to be restored .
<unk> of lying , with so strange a calmness , watching what was done for me , as if it were done for some one else whom I was quietly sorry for , I helped it a little , and so on to a little more and much more , until I became useful to myself , and interested , and attached to life again .
How well I remember the pleasant afternoon when I was raised in bed with pillows for the first time to enjoy a great <unk> with Charley !
The little creature — sent into the world , surely , to <unk> to the weak and sick — was so happy , and so busy , and stopped so often in her preparations to lay her head upon my bosom , and <unk> me , and cry with joyful tears she was so glad , she was so glad , that I was obliged to say , “ Charley , if you go on in this way , I must lie down again , my darling , for I am <unk> than I thought I was ! ” So Charley became as quiet as a mouse and took her bright face here and there across and across the two rooms , out of the shade into the <unk> sunshine , and out of the sunshine into the shade , while I watched her <unk> .
When all her preparations were concluded and the pretty <unk> with its little <unk> to <unk> me , and its white cloth , and its flowers , and everything so <unk> and <unk> arranged for me by Ada downstairs , was ready at the bedside , I felt sure I was steady enough to say something to Charley that was not new to my thoughts .
First I <unk> Charley on the room , and indeed it was so fresh and airy , so <unk> and neat , that I could <unk> believe I had been lying there so long .
This delighted Charley , and her face was brighter than before .
“ Yet , Charley , ” said I , looking round , “ I miss something , surely , that I am accustomed to ? ” Poor little Charley looked round too and pretended to shake her head as if there were nothing absent .
“ Are the pictures all as they used to be ? ” I asked her .
“ Every one of them , miss , ” said Charley .
“ And the furniture , Charley ? ” “ Except where I have moved it about to make more room , miss . ” “ And yet , ” said I , “ I miss some familiar object .
Ah , I know what it is , Charley !
It ’ s the <unk> . ” Charley got up from the table , making as if she had forgotten something , and went into the next room ; and I heard her sob there .
I had thought of this very often .
I was now certain of it .
I could thank God that it was not a shock to me now .
I called Charley back , and when she came — at first pretending to smile , but as she drew nearer to me , looking grieved — I took her in my arms and said , “ It matters very little , Charley .
I hope I can do without my old face very well . ” I was presently so far advanced as to be able to sit up in a great chair and even <unk> to walk into the adjoining room , leaning on Charley .
The <unk> was gone from its usual place in that room too , but what I had to bear was none the harder to bear for that .
My guardian had throughout been earnest to visit me , and there was now no good reason why I should deny myself that happiness .
He came one morning , and when he first came in , could only hold me in his embrace and say , “ My dear , dear girl ! ” I had long known — who could know better ? — what a deep <unk> of affection and generosity his heart was ; and was it not worth my trivial suffering and change to fill such a place in it ?
“ Oh , yes ! ” I thought .
“ He has seen me , and he loves me better than he did ; he has seen me and is even <unk> of me than he was before ; and what have I to <unk> for ! ” He sat down by me on the sofa , <unk> me with his arm .
For a little while he sat with his hand over his face , but when he removed it , fell into his usual manner .
There never can have been , there never can be , a pleasanter manner .
“ My little woman , ” said he , “ what a sad time this has been .
Such an inflexible little woman , too , through all ! ” “ Only for the best , guardian , ” said I.
“ For the best ? ” he repeated tenderly .
“ Of course , for the best .
But here have Ada and I been perfectly <unk> and miserable ; here has your friend Caddy been coming and going late and early ; here has every one about the house been utterly lost and dejected ; here has even poor Rick been writing — to ME too — in his anxiety for you ! ” I had read of Caddy in Ada ’ s letters , but not of Richard .
I told him so .
“ Why , no , my dear , ” he replied .
“ I have thought it better not to mention it to her . ” “ And you speak of his writing to YOU , ” said I , repeating his emphasis .
“ As if it were not natural for him to do so , guardian ; as if he could write to a better friend ! ” “ He thinks he could , my love , ” returned my guardian , “ and to many a better .
The truth is , he wrote to me under a sort of protest while unable to write to you with any hope of an answer — wrote <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Well , dearest little woman , we must look <unk> on it .
He is not to blame .
Jarndyce and Jarndyce has <unk> him out of himself and <unk> me in his eyes .
I have known it do as bad <unk> , and worse , many a time .
If two angels could be concerned in it , I believe it would change their nature . ” “ It has not changed yours , guardian . ” “ Oh , yes , it has , my dear , ” he said laughingly .
“ It has made the <unk> wind <unk> , I don ’ t know how often .
Rick <unk> and suspects me — goes to lawyers , and is taught to mistrust and suspect me .
<unk> I have <unk> interests , claims <unk> against his and what not .
Whereas , heaven knows that if I could get out of the mountains of <unk> on which my unfortunate name has been so long bestowed ( which I can ’ t ) or could level them by the <unk> of my own original right ( which I can ’ t either , and no human power ever can , <unk> , I believe , to such a pass have we got ) , I would do it this hour .
I would rather restore to poor Rick his proper nature than be <unk> with all the money that dead suitors , broken , heart and soul , upon the wheel of Chancery , have left <unk> with the <unk> — and that ’ s money enough , my dear , to be cast into a <unk> , in memory of Chancery ’ s <unk> <unk> . ” “ IS it possible , guardian , ” I asked , amazed , “ that Richard can be suspicious of you ? ” “ Ah , my love , my love , ” he said , “ it is in the <unk> <unk> of such <unk> to breed such <unk> .
His blood is <unk> , and objects lose their natural <unk> in his sight .
It is not HIS fault . ” “ But it is a terrible misfortune , guardian . ” “ It is a terrible misfortune , little woman , to be ever drawn within the influences of Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
I know none greater .
By little and little he has been induced to trust in that <unk> <unk> , and it <unk> some portion of its <unk> to everything around him .
But again I say with all my soul , we must be patient with poor Rick and not blame him .
What a <unk> of fine fresh hearts like his have I seen in my time turned by the same means ! ” I could not help expressing something of my wonder and regret that his benevolent , disinterested intentions had <unk> so little .
“ We must not say so , Dame Durden , ” he cheerfully replied ; “ Ada is the happier , I hope , and that is much .
I did think that I and both these young creatures might be friends instead of distrustful <unk> and that we might so far <unk> the suit and prove too strong for it .
But it was too much to expect .
Jarndyce and Jarndyce was the curtain of Rick ’ s <unk> . ” “ But , guardian , may we not hope that a little experience will teach him what a false and wretched thing it is ? ” “ We WILL hope so , my Esther , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , “ and that it may not teach him so too late .
In any case we must not be hard on him .
There are not many grown and <unk> men living while we speak , good men too , who if they were thrown into this same court as suitors would not be <unk> changed and <unk> within three years — within two — within one .
How can we stand amazed at poor Rick ?
A young man so unfortunate , ” here he fell into a lower tone , as if he were thinking aloud , “ cannot at first believe ( who could ? )
that Chancery is what it is .
He looks to it , flushed and <unk> , to do something with his interests and bring them to some settlement .
It <unk> , <unk> , tries , <unk> him ; wears out his sanguine hopes and patience , <unk> by <unk> ; but he still looks to it , and <unk> after it , and finds his whole world <unk> and hollow .
Well , well , well !
<unk> of this , my dear ! ” He had supported me , as at first , all this time , and his tenderness was so precious to me that I leaned my head upon his shoulder and loved him as if he had been my father .
I resolved in my own mind in this little pause , by some means , to see Richard when I grew strong and try to set him right .
“ There are better subjects than these , ” said my guardian , “ for such a joyful time as the time of our dear girl ’ s recovery .
And I had a commission to <unk> one of them as soon as I should begin to talk .
When shall Ada come to see you , my love ? ” I had been thinking of that too .
A little in connexion with the absent mirrors , but not much , for I knew my loving girl would be changed by no change in my looks .
“ Dear guardian , ” said I , “ as I have shut her out so long — though indeed , indeed , she is like the light to me — ” “ I know it well , Dame Durden , well . ” He was so good , his touch expressed such endearing compassion and affection , and the tone of his voice carried such comfort into my heart that I stopped for a little while , quite unable to go on .
“ Yes , yes , you are tired , ” said he .
“ <unk> a little . ” “ As I have kept Ada out so long , ” I began afresh after a short while , “ I think I should like to have my own way a little longer , guardian .
It would be best to be away from here before I see her .
If Charley and I were to go to some country lodging as soon as I can move , and if I had a week there in which to grow stronger and to be revived by the sweet air and to look forward to the happiness of having Ada with me again , I think it would be better for us . ” I hope it was not a poor thing in me to wish to be a little more used to my altered self before I met the eyes of the dear girl I longed so <unk> to see , but it is the truth .
I did .
He understood me , I was sure ; but I was not afraid of that .
If it were a poor thing , I knew he would pass it over .
“ Our <unk> little woman , ” said my guardian , “ shall have her own way even in her <unk> , though at the price , I know , of tears downstairs .
And see here !
Here is Boythorn , heart of <unk> , breathing such ferocious <unk> as never were breathed on paper before , that if you don ’ t go and occupy his whole house , he having already turned out of it expressly for that purpose , by heaven and by earth he ’ ll pull it down and not leave one brick standing on another ! ” And my guardian put a letter in my hand , without any ordinary beginning such as “ My dear Jarndyce , ” but rushing at once into the words , “ I <unk> if Miss Summerson do not come down and take possession of my house , which I <unk> for her this day at one o ’ clock , <unk> , ” and then with the utmost <unk> , and in the most emphatic terms , going on to make the extraordinary declaration he had <unk> .
We did not <unk> the writer the less for laughing heartily over it , and we settled that I should send him a letter of thanks on the morrow and accept his offer .
It was a most agreeable one to me , for all the places I could have thought of , I should have liked to go to none so well as Chesney Wold .
“ Now , little <unk> , ” said my guardian , looking at his watch , “ I was strictly <unk> before I came upstairs , for you must not be tired too soon ; and my time has <unk> away to the last minute .
I have one other <unk> .
Little Miss Flite , hearing a <unk> that you were ill , made nothing of walking down here — twenty miles , poor soul , in a pair of dancing shoes — to inquire .
It was heaven ’ s <unk> we were at home , or she would have walked back again . ” The old <unk> to make me happy !
Everybody seemed to be in it !
“ Now , pet , ” said my guardian , “ if it would not be <unk> to you to admit the harmless little creature one afternoon before you save Boythorn ’ s otherwise devoted house from <unk> , I believe you would make her <unk> and better pleased with herself than I — though my eminent name is Jarndyce — could do in a lifetime . ” I have no doubt he knew there would be something in the simple image of the poor afflicted creature that would fall like a gentle lesson on my mind at that time .
I felt it as he spoke to me .
I could not tell him heartily enough how ready I was to receive her .
I had always pitied her , never so much as now .
I had always been glad of my little power to <unk> her under her calamity , but never , never , half so glad before .
We arranged a time for Miss Flite to come out by the coach and share my early dinner .
When my guardian left me , I turned my face away upon my couch and prayed to be <unk> if I , surrounded by such <unk> , had <unk> to myself the little trial that I had to <unk> .
The childish prayer of that old birthday when I had aspired to be industrious , contented , and <unk> and to do good to some one and win some love to myself if I could came back into my mind with a <unk> sense of all the happiness I had since enjoyed and all the affectionate hearts that had been turned towards me .
If I were weak now , what had I <unk> by those <unk> ?
I repeated the old childish prayer in its old childish words and found that its old peace had not departed from it .
My guardian now came every day .
In a week or so more I could walk about our rooms and hold long talks with Ada from behind the <unk> .
Yet I never saw her , for I had not as yet the courage to look at the dear face , though I could have done so easily without her seeing me .
On the appointed day Miss Flite arrived .
The poor little creature ran into my room quite <unk> of her usual dignity , and crying from her very heart of hearts , “ My dear Fitz Jarndyce ! ” fell upon my neck and kissed me twenty times .
“ Dear me ! ” said she , putting her hand into her reticule , “ I have nothing here but documents , my dear Fitz Jarndyce ; I must borrow a pocket handkerchief . ” Charley gave her one , and the good creature certainly made use of it , for she held it to her eyes with both hands and sat so , <unk> tears for the next ten minutes .
“ With pleasure , my dear Fitz Jarndyce , ” she was careful to explain .
“ Not the least pain .
<unk> to see you well again .
<unk> at having the honour of being admitted to see you .
I am so much <unk> of you , my love , than of the Chancellor .
Though I DO attend court regularly .
By the by , my dear , mentioning pocket <unk> — ” Miss Flite here looked at Charley , who had been to meet her at the place where the coach stopped .
Charley glanced at me and looked unwilling to pursue the <unk> .
“ Ve-ry right ! ” said Miss Flite , “ Ve-ry correct .
Truly !
<unk> <unk> of me to mention it ; but my dear Miss Fitz Jarndyce , I am afraid I am at times ( between ourselves , you wouldn ’ t think it ) a little — rambling you know , ” said Miss Flite , touching her forehead .
“ Nothing more . ” “ What were you going to tell me ? ” said I , smiling , for I saw she wanted to go on .
“ You have <unk> my curiosity , and now you must <unk> it . ” Miss Flite looked at Charley for advice in this important <unk> , who said , “ If you please , ma ’ am , you had better tell then , ” and <unk> gratified Miss Flite beyond measure .
“ So sagacious , our young friend , ” said she to me in her mysterious way .
“ <unk> .
But <unk> sagacious !
Well , my dear , it ’ s a pretty <unk> .
Nothing more .
Still I think it charming .
Who should follow us down the road from the coach , my dear , but a poor person in a very <unk> bonnet — ” “ Jenny , if you please , miss , ” said Charley .
“ Just so ! ” Miss Flite <unk> with the greatest <unk> .
“ Jenny .
Ye-es !
And what does she tell our young friend but that there has been a lady with a veil <unk> at her cottage after my dear Fitz Jarndyce ’ s health and taking a handkerchief away with her as a little <unk> merely because it was my amiable Fitz Jarndyce ’ s !
Now , you know , so very prepossessing in the lady with the veil ! ” “ If you please , miss , ” said Charley , to whom I looked in some astonishment , “ Jenny says that when her baby died , you left a handkerchief there , and that she put it away and kept it with the baby ’ s little things .
I think , if you please , partly because it was yours , miss , and partly because it had covered the baby . ” “ <unk> , ” whispered Miss Flite , making a variety of motions about her own forehead to express <unk> in Charley .
“ But exceedingly sagacious !
And so dear !
My love , she ’ s clearer than any counsel I ever heard ! ” “ Yes , Charley , ” I returned .
“ I remember it .
Well ? ” “ Well , miss , ” said Charley , “ and that ’ s the handkerchief the lady took .
And Jenny wants you to know that she wouldn ’ t have made away with it herself for a heap of money but that the lady took it and left some money instead .
Jenny don ’ t know her at all , if you please , miss ! ” “ Why , who can she be ? ” said I.
“ My love , ” Miss Flite suggested , advancing her lips to my ear with her most mysterious look , “ in MY opinion — don ’ t mention this to our <unk> friend — she ’ s the Lord Chancellor ’ s wife .
He ’ s married , you know .
And I understand she leads him a terrible life .
<unk> his lordship ’ s papers into the fire , my dear , if he won ’ t pay the <unk> ! ” I did not think very much about this lady then , for I had an impression that it might be Caddy .
Besides , my attention was <unk> by my visitor , who was cold after her ride and looked hungry and who , our dinner being brought in , required some little assistance in <unk> herself with great satisfaction in a <unk> old <unk> and a <unk> and <unk> pair of gloves , which she had brought down in a paper <unk> .
I had to <unk> , too , over the entertainment , <unk> of a dish of fish , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ; and it was so pleasant to see how she enjoyed it , and with what state and ceremony she did honour to it , that I was soon thinking of nothing else .
When we had finished and had our little <unk> before us , <unk> by the hands of my dear , who would yield the <unk> of everything prepared for me to no one , Miss Flite was so very <unk> and happy that I thought I would lead her to her own history , as she was always pleased to talk about herself .
I began by saying “ You have attended on the Lord Chancellor many years , Miss Flite ? ” “ Oh , many , many , many years , my dear .
But I expect a judgment .
<unk> . ” There was an anxiety even in her <unk> that made me doubtful if I had done right in approaching the subject .
I thought I would say no more about it .
“ My father expected a judgment , ” said Miss Flite .
“ My brother .
My sister .
They all expected a judgment .
The same that I expect . ” “ They are all — ” “ Ye-es .
Dead of course , my dear , ” said she .
As I saw she would go on , I thought it best to try to be serviceable to her by meeting the theme rather than <unk> it .
“ Would it not be wiser , ” said I , “ to expect this judgment no more ? ” “ Why , my dear , ” she answered promptly , “ of course it would ! ” “ And to attend the court no more ? ” “ <unk> of course , ” said she .
“ Very wearing to be always in expectation of what never comes , my dear Fitz Jarndyce !
<unk> , I assure you , to the bone ! ” She slightly showed me her arm , and it was fearfully thin indeed .
“ But , my dear , ” she went on in her mysterious way , “ there ’ s a dreadful attraction in the place .
Hush !
Don ’ t mention it to our <unk> friend when she comes in .
Or it may <unk> her .
With good reason .
There ’ s a cruel attraction in the place .
You CAN ’ T leave it .
And you MUST expect . ” I tried to assure her that this was not so .
She heard me patiently and <unk> , but was ready with her own answer .
“ Aye , aye , aye !
You think so because I am a little rambling .
Ve-ry absurd , to be a little rambling , is it not ?
Ve-ry <unk> , too .
To the head .
I find it so .
But , my dear , I have been there many years , and I have noticed .
It ’ s the <unk> and seal upon the table . ” What could they do , did she think ?
I mildly asked her .
“ Draw , ” returned Miss Flite .
“ Draw people on , my dear .
Draw peace out of them .
<unk> out of them .
Good looks out of them .
Good qualities out of them .
I have felt them even drawing my rest away in the night .
<unk> and glittering <unk> ! ” She tapped me several times upon the arm and nodded good-humouredly as if she were anxious I should understand that I had no cause to fear her , though she spoke so gloomily , and confided these awful secrets to me .
“ Let me see , ” said she .
“ I ’ ll tell you my own case .
Before they ever drew me — before I had ever seen them — what was it I used to do ?
<unk> playing ?
No .
<unk> work .
I and my sister worked at <unk> work .
Our father and our brother had a <unk> ’ s business .
We all lived together .
Ve-ry <unk> , my dear !
First , our father was drawn — slowly .
Home was drawn with him .
In a few years he was a fierce , <unk> , angry <unk> without a kind word or a kind look for any one .
He had been so different , Fitz Jarndyce .
He was drawn to a <unk> ’ prison .
There he died .
Then our brother was drawn — swiftly — to <unk> .
And rags .
And death .
Then my sister was drawn .
Hush !
Never ask to what !
Then I was ill and in misery , and heard , as I had often heard before , that this was all the work of Chancery .
When I got better , I went to look at the monster .
And then I found out how it was , and I was drawn to stay there . ” Having got over her own short narrative , in the <unk> of which she had spoken in a low , <unk> voice , as if the shock were fresh upon her , she gradually resumed her usual air of amiable importance .
“ You don ’ t quite credit me , my dear !
Well , well !
You will , some day .
I am a little rambling .
But I have noticed .
I have seen many new faces come , <unk> , within the influence of the <unk> and seal in these many years .
As my father ’ s came there .
As my brother ’ s .
As my sister ’ s .
As my own .
I hear Conversation Kenge and the rest of them say to the new faces , ‘ Here ’ s little Miss Flite .
Oh , you are new here ; and you must come and be presented to little Miss Flite ! ’ Ve-ry good .
<unk> I am sure to have the honour !
And we all laugh .
But , Fitz Jarndyce , I know what will happen .
I know , far better than they do , when the attraction has begun .
I know the signs , my dear .
I saw them begin in Gridley .
And I saw them end .
Fitz Jarndyce , my love , ” speaking low again , “ I saw them beginning in our friend the ward in Jarndyce .
Let some one hold him back .
Or he ’ ll be drawn to ruin . ” She looked at me in silence for some moments , with her face gradually <unk> into a smile .
<unk> to fear that she had been too gloomy , and seeming also to lose the connexion in her mind , she said politely as she <unk> her glass of wine , “ Yes , my dear , as I was saying , I expect a judgment shortly .
Then I shall release my birds , you know , and confer <unk> . ” I was much impressed by her allusion to Richard and by the sad meaning , so <unk> <unk> in her poor pinched form , that made its way through all her <unk> .
But happily for her , she was quite complacent again now and <unk> with nods and smiles .
“ But , my dear , ” she said , gaily , <unk> another hand to put it upon mine .
“ You have not <unk> me on my physician .
<unk> not once , yet ! ” I was obliged to confess that I did not quite know what she meant .
“ My physician , Mr. Woodcourt , my dear , who was so exceedingly attentive to me .
Though his services were rendered quite <unk> .
<unk> the Day of <unk> .
I mean THE judgment that will <unk> the <unk> upon me of the <unk> and seal . ” “ Mr.
Woodcourt is so far away , now , ” said I , “ that I thought the time for such <unk> was past , Miss Flite . ” “ But , my child , ” she returned , “ is it possible that you don ’ t know what has happened ? ” “ No , ” said I.
“ Not what everybody has been talking of , my beloved Fitz Jarndyce ! ” “ No , ” said I.
“ You forget how long I have been here . ” “ True !
My dear , for the moment — true .
I blame myself .
But my memory has been drawn out of me , with everything else , by what I mentioned .
Ve-ry strong influence , is it not ?
Well , my dear , there has been a terrible shipwreck over in those <unk> <unk> <unk> . ” “ Mr.
Woodcourt <unk> ! ” “ Don ’ t be <unk> , my dear .
He is safe .
An awful scene .
Death in all shapes .
<unk> of dead and dying .
<unk> , storm , and darkness .
<unk> of the <unk> thrown upon a rock .
There , and through it all , my dear physician was a <unk> .
<unk> and brave through everything .
<unk> many lives , never complained in <unk> and <unk> , wrapped <unk> people in his spare clothes , took the lead , showed them what to do , <unk> them , <unk> the sick , buried the dead , and brought the poor <unk> safely off at last !
My dear , the poor <unk> creatures all but <unk> him .
They fell down at his feet when they got to the land and blessed him .
The whole country rings with it .
<unk> !
Where ’ s my bag of documents ?
I have got it there , and you shall read it , you shall read it ! ” And I <unk> read all the noble history , though very slowly and imperfectly then , for my eyes were so <unk> that I could not see the words , and I cried so much that I was many times obliged to lay down the long account she had cut out of the newspaper .
I felt so triumphant ever to have known the man who had done such generous and <unk> <unk> , I felt such glowing <unk> in his <unk> , I so admired and loved what he had done , that I <unk> the <unk> people who had fallen at his feet and blessed him as their <unk> .
I could myself have <unk> down then , so far away , and blessed him in my rapture that he should be so truly good and brave .
I felt that no one — mother , sister , wife — could honour him more than I. I did , indeed !
My poor little visitor made me a present of the account , and when as the evening began to close in she rose to take her leave , lest she should miss the coach by which she was to return , she was still full of the shipwreck , which I had not yet sufficiently composed myself to understand in all its details .
“ My dear , ” said she as she carefully folded up her <unk> and gloves , “ my brave physician ought to have a title bestowed upon him .
And no doubt he will .
You are of that opinion ? ” That he well <unk> one , yes .
That he would ever have one , no .
“ Why not , Fitz Jarndyce ? ” she asked rather sharply .
I said it was not the custom in England to confer titles on men distinguished by peaceful services , however good and great , unless occasionally when they <unk> of the <unk> of some very large amount of money .
“ Why , good gracious , ” said Miss Flite , “ how can you say that ?
Surely you know , my dear , that all the greatest ornaments of England in knowledge , imagination , active humanity , and <unk> of every sort are added to its <unk> !
Look round you , my dear , and consider .
YOU must be rambling a little now , I think , if you don ’ t know that this is the great reason why titles will always last in the land ! ” I am afraid she believed what she said , for there were moments when she was very mad indeed .
And now I must part with the little secret I have thus far tried to keep .
I had thought , sometimes , that Mr. Woodcourt loved me and that if he had been richer he would perhaps have told me that he loved me before he went away .
I had thought , sometimes , that if he had done so , I should have been glad of it .
But how much better it was now that this had never happened !
What should I have suffered if I had had to write to him and tell him that the poor face he had known as mine was quite gone from me and that I freely released him from his <unk> to one whom he had never seen !
Oh , it was so much better as it was !
With a great <unk> <unk> spared me , I could take back to my heart my childish prayer to be all he had so brightly shown himself ; and there was nothing to be undone : no chain for me to break or for him to <unk> ; and I could go , please God , my <unk> way along the path of duty , and he could go his <unk> way upon its <unk> road ; and though we were apart upon the journey , I might <unk> to meet him , <unk> , innocently , better far than he had thought me when I found some favour in his eyes , at the journey ’ s end .
CHAPTER <unk> Chesney Wold Charley and I did not set off alone upon our expedition into Lincolnshire .
My guardian had made up his mind not to lose sight of me until I was safe in Mr. Boythorn ’ s house , so he accompanied us , and we were two days upon the road .
I found every breath of air , and every <unk> , and every flower and leaf and <unk> of grass , and every passing cloud , and everything in nature , more beautiful and wonderful to me than I had ever found it yet .
This was my first gain from my illness .
How little I had lost , when the wide world was so full of delight for me .
My guardian <unk> to go back immediately , we appointed , on our way down , a day when my dear girl should come .
I wrote her a letter , of which he took charge , and he left us within half an hour of our arrival at our destination , on a delightful evening in the early <unk> .
If a good fairy had built the house for me with a wave of her <unk> , and I had been a <unk> and her favoured <unk> , I could not have been more considered in it .
So many preparations were made for me and such an endearing remembrance was shown of all my little tastes and <unk> that I could have sat down , overcome , a dozen times before I had <unk> half the rooms .
I did better than that , however , by showing them all to Charley instead .
Charley ’ s delight <unk> mine ; and after we had had a walk in the garden , and Charley had exhausted her whole <unk> of admiring expressions , I was as <unk> happy as I ought to have been .
It was a great comfort to be able to say to myself after tea , “ Esther , my dear , I think you are quite sensible enough to sit down now and write a note of thanks to your host . ” He had left a note of welcome for me , as sunny as his own face , and had confided his bird to my care , which I knew to be his highest mark of confidence .
<unk> I wrote a little note to him in London , telling him how all his favourite plants and trees were looking , and how the most astonishing of birds had <unk> the <unk> of the house to me in the most hospitable manner , and how , after singing on my shoulder , to the <unk> rapture of my little maid , he was then at <unk> in the usual corner of his <unk> , but whether <unk> or no I could not report .
My note finished and sent off to the post , I made myself very busy in <unk> and <unk> ; and I sent Charley to bed in good time and told her I should want her no more that night .
For I had not yet looked in the glass and had never asked to have my own restored to me .
I knew this to be a weakness which must be overcome , but I had always said to myself that I would begin afresh when I got to where I now was .
Therefore I had wanted to be alone , and therefore I said , now alone , in my own room , “ Esther , if you are to be happy , if you are to have any right to pray to be <unk> , you must keep your word , my dear . ” I was quite resolved to keep it , but I sat down for a little while first to reflect upon all my <unk> .
And then I said my prayers and thought a little more .
My hair had not been cut off , though it had been in danger more than once .
It was long and thick .
I let it down , and shook it out , and went up to the glass upon the <unk> .
There was a little <unk> curtain drawn across it .
I drew it back and stood for a moment looking through such a veil of my own hair that I could see nothing else .
Then I put my hair aside and looked at the reflection in the <unk> , encouraged by seeing how <unk> it looked at me .
I was very much changed — oh , very , very much .
At first my face was so strange to me that I think I should have put my hands before it and started back but for the encouragement I have mentioned .
Very soon it became more familiar , and then I knew the extent of the <unk> in it better than I had done at first .
It was not like what I had expected , but I had expected nothing <unk> , and I dare say anything <unk> would have surprised me .
I had never been a beauty and had never thought myself one , but I had been very different from this .
It was all gone now .
Heaven was so good to me that I could let it go with a few not bitter tears and could stand there <unk> my hair for the night quite <unk> .
One thing troubled me , and I considered it for a long time before I went to sleep .
I had kept Mr. Woodcourt ’ s flowers .
When they were withered I had dried them and put them in a book that I was fond of .
Nobody knew this , not even Ada .
I was doubtful whether I had a right to preserve what he had sent to one so different — whether it was generous towards him to do it .
I wished to be generous to him , even in the secret <unk> of my heart , which he would never know , because I could have loved him — could have been devoted to him .
At last I came to the conclusion that I might keep them if I <unk> them only as a remembrance of what was <unk> past and gone , never to be looked back on any more , in any other light .
I hope this may not seem trivial .
I was very much in earnest .
I took care to be up early in the morning and to be before the glass when Charley came in on <unk> .
“ Dear , dear , miss ! ” cried Charley , starting .
“ Is that you ? ” “ Yes , Charley , ” said I , quietly putting up my hair .
“ And I am very well indeed , and very happy . ” I saw it was a weight off Charley ’ s mind , but it was a greater weight off mine .
I knew the worst now and was composed to it .
I shall not conceal , as I go on , the weaknesses I could not quite conquer , but they always passed from me soon and the happier <unk> of mind stayed by me faithfully .
<unk> to be fully <unk> in my strength and my good spirits before Ada came , I now laid down a little series of plans with Charley for being in the fresh air all day long .
We were to be out before breakfast , and were to dine early , and were to be out again before and after dinner , and were to talk in the garden after tea , and were to go to rest <unk> , and were to <unk> every hill and <unk> every road , lane , and field in the neighbourhood .
As to <unk> and strengthening <unk> , Mr. Boythorn ’ s good housekeeper was for ever <unk> about with something to eat or drink in her hand ; I could not even be heard of as resting in the park but she would come <unk> after me with a basket , her cheerful face shining with a <unk> on the importance of frequent <unk> .
Then there was a pony expressly for my riding , a <unk> pony with a short neck and a <unk> all over his eyes who could canter — when he would — so easily and quietly that he was a <unk> .
In a very few days he would come to me in the <unk> when I called him , and eat out of my hand , and follow me about .
We arrived at such a capital understanding that when he was <unk> with me <unk> , and rather <unk> , down some shady lane , if I patted his neck and said , “ Stubbs , I am surprised you don ’ t canter when you know how much I like it ; and I think you might oblige me , for you are only getting <unk> and going to sleep , ” he would give his head a <unk> shake or two and set off directly , while Charley would stand still and laugh with such enjoyment that her laughter was like music .
I don ’ t know who had given Stubbs his name , but it seemed to belong to him as naturally as his rough coat .
Once we put him in a little chaise and drove him triumphantly through the green <unk> for five miles ; but all at once , as we were <unk> him to the <unk> , he seemed to take it ill that he should have been accompanied so far by the circle of <unk> little <unk> that had been hovering round and round his ears the whole way without appearing to advance an <unk> , and stopped to think about it .
I suppose he came to the decision that it was not to be borne , for he steadily refused to move until I gave the <unk> to Charley and got out and walked , when he followed me with a <unk> sort of good humour , putting his head under my arm and rubbing his ear against my sleeve .
It was in vain for me to say , “ Now , Stubbs , I feel quite sure from what I know of you that you will go on if I ride a little while , ” for the moment I left him , he stood stock still again .
Consequently I was obliged to lead the way , as before ; and in this order we returned home , to the great delight of the village .
Charley and I had reason to call it the most friendly of <unk> , I am sure , for in a week ’ s time the people were so glad to see us go by , though ever so frequently in the course of a day , that there were faces of <unk> in every cottage .
I had known many of the grown people before and almost all the children , but now the very <unk> began to wear a familiar and affectionate look .
Among my new friends was an old old woman who lived in such a little <unk> and whitewashed dwelling that when the outside <unk> was turned up on its <unk> , it shut up the whole <unk> .
This old lady had a grandson who was a sailor , and I wrote a letter to him for her and drew at the top of it the <unk> in which she had brought him up and where his old stool yet occupied its old place .
This was considered by the whole village the most wonderful <unk> in the world , but when an answer came back all the way from <unk> , in which he mentioned that he was going to take the picture all the way to America , and from America would write again , I got all the credit that ought to have been given to the post-office and was <unk> with the merit of the whole system .
Thus , what with being so much in the air , playing with so many children , <unk> with so many people , sitting on <unk> in so many <unk> , going on with Charley ’ s education , and writing long letters to Ada every day , I had scarcely any time to think about that little loss of mine and was almost always cheerful .
If I did think of it at odd moments now and then , I had only to be busy and forget it .
I felt it more than I had hoped I should once when a child said , “ Mother , why is the lady not a pretty lady now like she used to be ? ” But when I found the child was not less fond of me , and drew its soft hand over my face with a kind of <unk> protection in its touch , that soon set me up again .
There were many little occurrences which suggested to me , with great consolation , how natural it is to gentle hearts to be considerate and delicate towards any <unk> .
One of these particularly touched me .
I happened to <unk> into the little church when a marriage was just concluded , and the young couple had to sign the <unk> .
The <unk> , to whom the pen was handed first , made a <unk> cross for his mark ; the bride , who came next , did the same .
Now , I had known the bride when I was last there , not only as the <unk> girl in the place , but as having quite distinguished herself in the school , and I could not help looking at her with some surprise .
She came aside and whispered to me , while tears of honest love and admiration stood in her bright eyes , “ He ’ s a dear good fellow , miss ; but he can ’ t write yet — he ’ s going to learn of me — and I wouldn ’ t shame him for the world ! ” Why , what had I to fear , I thought , when there was this <unk> in the soul of a labouring man ’ s daughter !
The air blew as <unk> and <unk> upon me as it had ever blown , and the healthy colour came into my new face as it had come into my old one .
Charley was wonderful to see , she was so radiant and so rosy ; and we both enjoyed the whole day and slept <unk> the whole night .
There was a favourite spot of mine in the <unk> of Chesney Wold where a seat had been <unk> commanding a lovely view .
The wood had been cleared and opened to improve this point of sight , and the bright sunny landscape beyond was so beautiful that I rested there at least once every day .
A <unk> part of the Hall , called the Ghost ’ s Walk , was seen to advantage from this higher ground ; and the <unk> name , and the old <unk> in the Dedlock family which I had heard from Mr. Boythorn <unk> for it , mingled with the view and gave it something of a mysterious interest in addition to its real charms .
There was a bank here , too , which was a famous one for <unk> ; and as it was a daily delight of Charley ’ s to <unk> wild flowers , she took as much to the spot as I did .
It would be idle to inquire now why I never went close to the house or never went inside it .
The family were not there , I had heard on my arrival , and were not expected .
I was far from being <unk> or <unk> about the building ; on the contrary , I often sat in this place wondering how the rooms <unk> and whether any echo like a <unk> really did <unk> at times , as the story said , upon the lonely Ghost ’ s Walk .
The <unk> feeling with which Lady Dedlock had impressed me may have had some influence in keeping me from the house even when she was absent .
I am not sure .
Her face and figure were associated with it , naturally ; but I cannot say that they <unk> me from it , though something did .
For whatever reason or no reason , I had never once gone near it , down to the day at which my story now arrives .
I was resting at my favourite point after a long <unk> , and Charley was <unk> <unk> at a little distance from me .
I had been looking at the Ghost ’ s Walk lying in a deep shade of <unk> afar off and <unk> to myself the female shape that was said to <unk> it when I became aware of a figure approaching through the wood .
The perspective was so long and so darkened by leaves , and the shadows of the branches on the ground made it so much more <unk> to the eye , that at first I could not <unk> what figure it was .
By little and little it revealed itself to be a woman ’ s — a lady ’ s — Lady Dedlock ’ s .
She was alone and coming to where I sat with a much <unk> step , I observed to my surprise , than was usual with her .
I was fluttered by her being unexpectedly so near ( she was almost within speaking distance before I knew her ) and would have risen to continue my walk .
But I could not .
I was rendered motionless .
Not so much by her hurried gesture of entreaty , not so much by her quick advance and <unk> hands , not so much by the great change in her manner and the absence of her haughty <unk> , as by a something in her face that I had <unk> for and dreamed of when I was a little child , something I had never seen in any face , something I had never seen in hers before .
A dread and <unk> fell upon me , and I called to Charley .
Lady Dedlock stopped upon the instant and changed back almost to what I had known her .
“ Miss Summerson , I am afraid I have startled you , ” she said , now advancing slowly .
“ You can scarcely be strong yet .
You have been very ill , I know .
I have been much concerned to hear it . ” I could no more have removed my eyes from her pale face than I could have stirred from the bench on which I sat .
She gave me her hand , and its deadly <unk> , so at <unk> with the <unk> composure of her features , <unk> the fascination that overpowered me .
I cannot say what was in my <unk> thoughts .
“ You are recovering again ? ” she asked kindly .
“ I was quite well but a moment ago , Lady Dedlock . ” “ Is this your young attendant ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Will you send her on before and walk towards your house with me ? ” “ Charley , ” said I , “ take your flowers home , and I will follow you directly . ” Charley , with her best curtsy , <unk> tied on her bonnet and went her way .
When she was gone , Lady Dedlock sat down on the seat beside me .
I cannot tell in any words what the state of my mind was when I saw in her hand my handkerchief with which I had covered the dead baby .
I looked at her , but I could not see her , I could not hear her , I could not draw my breath .
The beating of my heart was so violent and wild that I felt as if my life were breaking from me .
But when she caught me to her breast , kissed me , wept over me , <unk> me , and called me back to myself ; when she fell down on her knees and cried to me , “ Oh , my child , my child , I am your wicked and unhappy mother !
Oh , try to forgive me ! ” — when I saw her at my feet on the bare earth in her great agony of mind , I felt , through all my <unk> of emotion , a burst of gratitude to the <unk> of God that I was so changed as that I never could disgrace her by any trace of likeness , as that nobody could ever now look at me and look at her and <unk> think of any near tie between us .
I raised my mother up , <unk> and <unk> her not to <unk> before me in such affliction and <unk> .
I did so in broken , <unk> words , for besides the trouble I was in , it frightened me to see her at MY feet .
I told her — or I tried to tell her — that if it were for me , her child , under any circumstances to take upon me to forgive her , I did it , and had done it , many , many years .
I told her that my heart <unk> with love for her , that it was natural love which nothing in the past had changed or could change .
That it was not for me , then resting for the first time on my mother ’ s bosom , to take her to account for having given me life , but that my duty was to bless her and receive her , though the whole world turned from her , and that I only asked her leave to do it .
I held my mother in my embrace , and she held me in hers , and among the still woods in the silence of the summer day there seemed to be nothing but our two troubled minds that was not at peace .
“ To bless and receive me , ” <unk> my mother , “ it is far too late .
I must travel my dark road alone , and it will lead me where it will .
From day to day , sometimes from hour to hour , I do not see the way before my guilty feet .
This is the earthly <unk> I have brought upon myself .
I bear it , and I hide it . ” Even in the thinking of her <unk> , she drew her habitual air of proud indifference about her like a veil , though she soon cast it off again .
“ I must keep this secret , if by any means it can be kept , not wholly for myself .
I have a husband , wretched and <unk> creature that I am ! ” These words she uttered with a suppressed cry of despair , more terrible in its sound than any <unk> .
<unk> her face with her hands , she <unk> down in my embrace as if she were unwilling that I should touch her ; nor could I , by my utmost <unk> or by any <unk> I could use , <unk> upon her to rise .
She said , no , no , no , she could only speak to me so ; she must be proud and disdainful everywhere else ; she would be <unk> and ashamed there , in the only natural moments of her life .
My unhappy mother told me that in my illness she had been nearly <unk> .
She had but then known that her child was living .
She could not have suspected me to be that child before .
She had followed me down here to speak to me but once in all her life .
We never could <unk> , never could communicate , never probably from that time forth could <unk> another word on earth .
She put into my hands a letter she had written for my reading only and said when I had read it and destroyed it — but not so much for her sake , since she asked nothing , as for her husband ’ s and my own — I must evermore consider her as dead .
If I could believe that she loved me , in this agony in which I saw her , with a mother ’ s love , she asked me to do that , for then I might think of her with a greater pity , <unk> what she suffered .
She had put herself beyond all hope and beyond all help .
Whether she preserved her secret until death or it came to be discovered and she brought <unk> and disgrace upon the name she had taken , it was her solitary struggle always ; and no affection could come near her , and no human creature could render her any aid .
“ But is the secret safe so far ? ” I asked .
“ Is it safe now , dearest mother ? ” “ No , ” replied my mother .
“ It has been very near discovery .
It was saved by an accident .
It may be lost by another accident — to-morrow , any day . ” “ Do you dread a particular person ? ” “ Hush !
Do not tremble and cry so much for me .
I am not worthy of these tears , ” said my mother , kissing my hands .
“ I dread one person very much . ” “ An enemy ? ” “ Not a friend .
One who is too <unk> to be either .
He is Sir Leicester Dedlock ’ s lawyer , <unk> faithful without attachment , and very jealous of the profit , privilege , and reputation of being master of the mysteries of great houses . ” “ Has he any suspicions ? ” “ Many . ” “ Not of you ? ” I said alarmed .
“ Yes !
He is always <unk> and always near me .
I may keep him at a <unk> , but I can never shake him off . ” “ Has he so little pity or <unk> ? ” “ He has none , and no anger .
He is indifferent to everything but his calling .
His calling is the <unk> of secrets and the holding possession of such power as they give him , with no <unk> or <unk> in it . ” “ Could you trust in him ? ” “ I shall never try .
The dark road I have trodden for so many years will end where it will .
I follow it alone to the end , whatever the end be .
It may be near , it may be distant ; while the road <unk> , nothing turns me . ” “ Dear mother , are you so resolved ? ” “ I AM resolved .
I have long <unk> folly with folly , pride with pride , scorn with scorn , <unk> with <unk> , and have <unk> many <unk> with many more .
I will <unk> this danger , and <unk> it , if I can .
It has closed around me almost as <unk> as if these woods of Chesney Wold had closed around the house , but my course through it is the same .
I have but one ; I can have but one . ” “ Mr.
Jarndyce — ” I was beginning when my mother hurriedly inquired , “ Does HE suspect ? ” “ No , ” said I.
“ No , indeed !
Be assured that he does not ! ” And I told her what he had related to me as his knowledge of my story .
“ But he is so good and sensible , ” said I , “ that perhaps if he knew — ” My mother , who until this time had made no change in her position , raised her hand up to my lips and stopped me .
“ <unk> fully in him , ” she said after a little while .
“ You have my free consent — a small <unk> from such a mother to her injured child ! — but do not tell me of it .
Some pride is left in me even yet . ” I explained , as nearly as I could then , or can recall now — for my agitation and distress throughout were so great that I scarcely understood myself , though every word that was uttered in the mother ’ s voice , so <unk> and so melancholy to me , which in my childhood I had never learned to love and <unk> , had never been <unk> to sleep with , had never heard a blessing from , had never had a hope inspired by , made an <unk> impression on my memory — I say I explained , or tried to do it , how I had only hoped that Mr. Jarndyce , who had been the best of fathers to me , might be able to afford some counsel and support to her .
But my mother answered no , it was impossible ; no one could help her .
Through the desert that lay before her , she must go alone .
“ My child , my child ! ” she said .
“ For the last time !
These kisses for the last time !
These arms upon my neck for the last time !
We shall meet no more .
To hope to do what I seek to do , I must be what I have been so long .
Such is my reward and <unk> .
If you hear of Lady Dedlock , brilliant , prosperous , and <unk> , think of your wretched mother , <unk> , underneath that <unk> !
Think that the reality is in her suffering , in her useless remorse , in her <unk> within her breast the only love and truth of which it is capable !
And then forgive her if you can , and cry to heaven to forgive her , which it never can ! ” We held one another for a little space yet , but she was so firm that she took my hands away , and put them back against my breast , and with a last kiss as she held them there , released them , and went from me into the wood .
I was alone , and calm and quiet below me in the sun and shade lay the old house , with its <unk> and <unk> , on which there had seemed to me to be such complete repose when I first saw it , but which now looked like the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of my mother ’ s misery .
<unk> as I was , as weak and helpless at first as I had ever been in my sick chamber , the necessity of <unk> against the danger of discovery , or even of the remotest suspicion , did me service .
I took such precautions as I could to hide from Charley that I had been crying , and I constrained myself to think of every sacred obligation that there was upon me to be careful and collected .
It was not a little while before I could succeed or could even <unk> <unk> of grief , but after an hour or so I was better and felt that I might return .
I went home very slowly and told Charley , whom I found at the gate looking for me , that I had been tempted to extend my walk after Lady Dedlock had left me and that I was <unk> and would lie down .
<unk> in my own room , I read the letter .
I clearly derived from it — and that was much then — that I had not been abandoned by my mother .
Her elder and only sister , the godmother of my childhood , discovering signs of life in me when I had been laid aside as dead , had in her stern sense of duty , with no desire or <unk> that I should live , <unk> me in <unk> secrecy and had never again beheld my mother ’ s face from within a few hours of my birth .
So strangely did I hold my place in this world that until within a short time back I had never , to my own mother ’ s knowledge , breathed — had been buried — had never been <unk> with life — had never borne a name .
When she had first seen me in the church she had been startled and had thought of what would have been like me if it had ever lived , and had lived on , but that was all then .
What more the letter told me <unk> not to be repeated here .
It has its own times and places in my story .
My first care was to burn what my mother had written and to <unk> even its ashes .
I hope it may not appear very unnatural or bad in me that I then became heavily sorrowful to think I had ever been <unk> .
That I felt as if I knew it would have been better and happier for many people if indeed I had never breathed .
That I had a terror of myself as the danger and the possible disgrace of my own mother and of a proud family name .
That I was so confused and shaken as to be possessed by a belief that it was right and had been intended that I should die in my birth , and that it was wrong and not intended that I should be then alive .
These are the real feelings that I had .
I fell asleep worn out , and when I awoke I cried afresh to think that I was back in the world with my load of trouble for others .
I was more than ever frightened of myself , thinking anew of her against whom I was a witness , of the owner of Chesney Wold , of the new and terrible meaning of the old words now <unk> in my ear like a <unk> upon the shore , “ Your mother , Esther , was your disgrace , and you are hers .
The time will come — and soon enough — when you will understand this better , and will feel it too , as no one save a woman can . ” With them , those other words returned , “ Pray daily that the sins of others be not visited upon your head . ” I could not <unk> all that was about me , and I felt as if the blame and the shame were all in me , and the <unk> had come down .
The day <unk> into a gloomy evening , <unk> and sad , and I still <unk> with the same distress .
I went out alone , and after walking a little in the park , watching the dark shades falling on the trees and the <unk> flight of the <unk> , which sometimes almost touched me , was attracted to the house for the first time .
Perhaps I might not have gone near it if I had been in a stronger <unk> of mind .
As it was , I took the path that led close by it .
I did not dare to linger or to look up , but I passed before the terrace garden with its <unk> <unk> , and its broad walks , and its <unk> beds and smooth turf ; and I saw how beautiful and grave it was , and how the old stone <unk> and <unk> , and wide <unk> of <unk> steps , were <unk> by time and weather ; and how the <unk> moss and ivy grew about them , and around the old stone <unk> of the <unk> ; and I heard the <unk> falling .
Then the way went by long lines of dark windows <unk> by <unk> towers and <unk> of eccentric shapes , where old stone <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> outside <unk> of shadow and <unk> at the evening gloom over the <unk> they held in their <unk> .
<unk> the path wound underneath a gateway , and through a court-yard where the principal entrance was ( I hurried quickly on ) , and by the stables where none but deep voices seemed to be , whether in the <unk> of the wind through the strong <unk> of ivy holding to a high red wall , or in the low <unk> of the <unk> , or in the <unk> of the dogs , or in the slow striking of a clock .
So , <unk> presently a sweet smell of <unk> , whose rustling I could hear , I turned with the turning of the path to the <unk> front , and there above me were the <unk> of the Ghost ’ s Walk and one lighted window that might be my mother ’ s .
The way was <unk> here , like the terrace overhead , and my footsteps from being <unk> made an echoing sound upon the <unk> .
<unk> to look at nothing , but seeing all I did see as I went , I was passing quickly on , and in a few moments should have passed the lighted window , when my echoing footsteps brought it suddenly into my mind that there was a dreadful truth in the <unk> of the Ghost ’ s Walk , that it was I who was to bring calamity upon the stately house and that my warning feet were <unk> it even then .
<unk> with an <unk> terror of myself which turned me cold , I ran from myself and everything , <unk> the way by which I had come , and never <unk> until I had gained the <unk> , and the park lay <unk> and black behind me .
Not before I was alone in my own room for the night and had again been dejected and unhappy there did I begin to know how wrong and <unk> this state was .
But from my darling who was coming on the morrow , I found a joyful letter , full of such loving <unk> that I must have been of <unk> if it had not moved me ; from my guardian , too , I found another letter , asking me to tell Dame Durden , if I should see that little woman anywhere , that they had <unk> most <unk> without her , that the housekeeping was going to <unk> and ruin , that nobody else could manage the keys , and that everybody in and about the house <unk> it was not the same house and was becoming <unk> for her return .
Two such letters together made me think how far beyond my <unk> I was beloved and how happy I ought to be .
That made me think of all my past life ; and that brought me , as it ought to have done before , into a better condition .
For I saw very well that I could not have been intended to die , or I should never have lived ; not to say should never have been reserved for such a happy life .
I saw very well how many things had worked together for my welfare , and that if the sins of the fathers were sometimes visited upon the children , the phrase did not mean what I had in the morning feared it meant .
I knew I was as innocent of my birth as a queen of hers and that before my <unk> Father I should not be punished for birth nor a queen <unk> for it .
I had had experience , in the shock of that very day , that I could , even thus soon , find <unk> <unk> to the change that had fallen on me .
I renewed my <unk> and prayed to be strengthened in them , <unk> out my heart for myself and for my unhappy mother and feeling that the darkness of the morning was passing away .
It was not upon my sleep ; and when the next day ’ s light awoke me , it was gone .
My dear girl was to <unk> at five o ’ clock in the afternoon .
How to help myself through the <unk> time better than by taking a long walk along the road by which she was to come , I did not know ; so Charley and I and Stubbs — Stubbs <unk> , for we never drove him after the one great occasion — made a long expedition along that road and back .
On our return , we held a great <unk> of the house and garden and saw that everything was in its <unk> condition , and had the bird out ready as an important part of the establishment .
There were more than two full hours yet to <unk> before she could come , and in that interval , which seemed a long one , I must confess I was <unk> anxious about my altered looks .
I loved my darling so well that I was more concerned for their effect on her than on any one .
I was not in this slight distress because I at all <unk> — I am quite certain I did not , that day — but , I thought , would she be wholly prepared ?
When she first saw me , might she not be a little shocked and disappointed ?
Might it not prove a little worse than she expected ?
Might she not look for her old Esther and not find her ?
Might she not have to grow used to me and to begin all over again ?
I knew the various expressions of my sweet girl ’ s face so well , and it was such an honest face in its <unk> , that I was sure beforehand she could not hide that first look from me .
And I considered whether , if it should <unk> any one of these <unk> , which was so very likely , could I quite answer for myself ?
Well , I thought I could .
After last night , I thought I could .
But to wait and wait , and expect and expect , and think and think , was such bad preparation that I resolved to go along the road again and meet her .
So I said to Charley , “ Charley , I will go by myself and walk along the road until she comes . ” Charley highly approving of anything that pleased me , I went and left her at home .
But before I got to the second <unk> , I had been in so many <unk> from seeing dust in the distance ( though I knew it was not , and could not , be the coach yet ) that I resolved to turn back and go home again .
And when I had turned , I was in such fear of the coach coming up behind me ( though I still knew that it neither would , nor could , do any such thing ) that I ran the greater part of the way to avoid being <unk> .
Then , I considered , when I had got safe back again , this was a nice thing to have done !
Now I was hot and had made the worst of it instead of the best .
At last , when I believed there was at least a quarter of an hour more yet , Charley all at once cried out to me as I was trembling in the garden , “ Here she comes , miss !
Here she is ! ” I did not mean to do it , but I ran upstairs into my room and hid myself behind the door .
There I stood trembling , even when I heard my darling calling as she came upstairs , “ Esther , my dear , my love , where are you ?
Little woman , dear Dame Durden ! ” She ran in , and was running out again when she saw me .
Ah , my angel girl !
The old dear look , all love , all <unk> , all affection .
Nothing else in it — no , nothing , nothing !
Oh , how happy I was , down upon the floor , with my sweet beautiful girl down upon the floor too , holding my <unk> face to her lovely cheek , <unk> it with tears and kisses , <unk> me to and fro like a child , calling me by every tender name that she could think of , and pressing me to her faithful heart .
CHAPTER <unk> Jarndyce and Jarndyce If the secret I had to keep had been mine , I must have confided it to Ada before we had been long together .
But it was not mine , and I did not feel that I had a right to tell it , even to my guardian , unless some great <unk> arose .
It was a weight to bear alone ; still my present duty appeared to be plain , and blest in the attachment of my dear , I did not want an impulse and encouragement to do it .
Though often when she was asleep and all was quiet , the remembrance of my mother kept me waking and made the night sorrowful , I did not yield to it at another time ; and Ada found me what I used to be — except , of course , in that particular of which I have said enough and which I have no intention of mentioning any more just now , if I can help it .
The difficulty that I felt in being quite composed that first evening when Ada asked me , over our work , if the family were at the house , and when I was obliged to answer yes , I believed so , for Lady Dedlock had spoken to me in the woods the day before yesterday , was great .
<unk> still when Ada asked me what she had said , and when I replied that she had been kind and interested , and when Ada , while <unk> her beauty and <unk> , remarked upon her proud manner and her <unk> <unk> air .
But Charley helped me through , unconsciously , by telling us that Lady Dedlock had only stayed at the house two nights on her way from London to visit at some other great house in the next county and that she had left early on the morning after we had seen her at our view , as we called it .
Charley <unk> the <unk> about little <unk> , I am sure , for she heard of more <unk> and <unk> in a day than would have come to my ears in a month .
We were to stay a month at Mr. Boythorn ’ s .
My pet had scarcely been there a bright week , as I recollect the time , when one evening after we had finished helping the gardener in <unk> his flowers , and just as the candles were lighted , Charley , appearing with a very important air behind Ada ’ s chair , <unk> me mysteriously out of the room .
“ Oh !
If you please , miss , ” said Charley in a whisper , with her eyes at their <unk> and <unk> .
“ You ’ re wanted at the Dedlock Arms . ” “ Why , Charley , ” said I , “ who can possibly want me at the public-house ? ” “ I don ’ t know , miss , ” returned Charley , putting her head forward and folding her hands tight upon the <unk> of her little apron , which she always did in the enjoyment of anything mysterious or confidential , “ but it ’ s a gentleman , miss , and his compliments , and will you please to come without saying anything about it . ” “ <unk> compliments , Charley ? ” “ His ’ n , miss , ” returned Charley , whose <unk> education was advancing , but not very rapidly .
“ And how do you come to be the messenger , Charley ? ” “ I am not the messenger , if you please , miss , ” returned my little maid .
“ It was <unk> Grubble , miss . ” “ And who is <unk> Grubble , Charley ? ” “ <unk> Grubble , miss , ” returned Charley .
“ Don ’ t you know , miss ?
The Dedlock Arms , by <unk> Grubble , ” which Charley delivered as if she were slowly <unk> out the sign .
“ Aye ?
The landlord , Charley ? ” “ Yes , miss .
If you please , miss , his wife is a beautiful woman , but she broke her <unk> , and it never joined .
And her brother ’ s the <unk> that was put in the <unk> , miss , and they expect he ’ ll drink himself to death entirely on beer , ” said Charley .
Not knowing what might be the matter , and being easily apprehensive now , I thought it best to go to this place by myself .
I <unk> Charley be quick with my bonnet and veil and my shawl , and having put them on , went away down the little <unk> street , where I was as much at home as in Mr. Boythorn ’ s garden .
Mr. Grubble was standing in his <unk> at the door of his very clean little <unk> waiting for me .
He lifted off his hat with both hands when he saw me coming , and carrying it so , as if it were an iron vessel ( it looked as heavy ) , preceded me along the <unk> passage to his best parlour , a neat <unk> room with more plants in it than were quite convenient , a coloured print of <unk> Caroline , several <unk> , a good many <unk> , two stuffed and dried fish in glass cases , and either a curious <unk> or a curious <unk> ( but I don ’ t know which , and I doubt if many people did ) hanging from his ceiling .
I knew Mr. Grubble very well by sight , from his often standing at his door .
A <unk> , <unk> , middle-aged man who never seemed to consider himself <unk> dressed for his own <unk> without his hat and <unk> , but who never wore a coat except at church .
He <unk> the candle , and <unk> away a little to see how it looked , backed out of the room — unexpectedly to me , for I was going to ask him by whom he had been sent .
The door of the opposite parlour being then opened , I heard some voices , familiar in my ears I thought , which stopped .
A quick light step approached the room in which I was , and who should stand before me but Richard !
“ My dear Esther ! ” he said .
“ My best friend ! ” And he really was so <unk> and earnest that in the first surprise and pleasure of his brotherly <unk> I could scarcely find breath to tell him that Ada was well .
“ <unk> my very thoughts — always the same dear girl ! ” said Richard , leading me to a chair and <unk> himself beside me .
I put my veil up , but not quite .
“ Always the same dear girl ! ” said Richard just as heartily as before .
I put up my veil altogether , and laying my hand on Richard ’ s sleeve and looking in his face , told him how much I thanked him for his kind welcome and how greatly I rejoiced to see him , the more so because of the determination I had made in my illness , which I now conveyed to him .
“ My love , ” said Richard , “ there is no one with whom I have a greater wish to talk than you , for I want you to understand me . ” “ And I want you , Richard , ” said I , shaking my head , “ to understand some one else . ” “ Since you refer so immediately to John Jarndyce , ” said Richard , “ — I suppose you mean him ? ” “ Of course I do . ” “ Then I may say at once that I am glad of it , because it is on that subject that I am anxious to be understood .
By you , mind — you , my dear !
I am not <unk> to Mr. Jarndyce or Mr. <unk> . ” I was <unk> to find him taking this tone , and he observed it .
“ Well , well , my dear , ” said Richard , “ we won ’ t go into that now .
I want to appear quietly in your <unk> here , with you under my arm , and give my charming cousin a surprise .
I suppose your <unk> to John Jarndyce will allow that ? ” “ My dear Richard , ” I returned , “ you know you would be heartily welcome at his house — your home , if you will but consider it so ; and you are as heartily welcome here ! ” “ <unk> like the best of little women ! ” cried Richard gaily .
I asked him how he liked his profession .
“ Oh , I like it well enough ! ” said Richard .
“ It ’ s all right .
It does as well as anything else , for a time .
I don ’ t know that I shall care about it when I come to be settled , but I can sell out then and — however , never mind all that <unk> at present . ” So young and handsome , and in all respects so perfectly the opposite of Miss Flite !
And yet , in the <unk> , eager , seeking look that passed over him , so dreadfully like her !
“ I am in town on leave just now , ” said Richard .
“ Indeed ? ” “ Yes .
I have run over to look after my — my Chancery interests before the long vacation , ” said Richard , <unk> a careless laugh .
“ We are beginning to <unk> along with that old suit at last , I promise you . ” No wonder that I shook my head !
“ As you say , it ’ s not a pleasant subject . ” Richard spoke with the same shade crossing his face as before .
“ Let it go to the four winds for to-night .
<unk> !
<unk> !
Who do you suppose is with me ? ” “ Was it Mr. Skimpole ’ s voice I heard ? ” “ That ’ s the man !
He does me more good than anybody .
What a fascinating child it is ! ” I asked Richard if any one knew of their coming down together .
He answered , no , nobody .
He had been to call upon the dear old infant — so he called Mr. Skimpole — and the dear old infant had told him where we were , and he had told the dear old infant he was bent on coming to see us , and the dear old infant had directly wanted to come too ; and so he had brought him .
“ And he is worth — not to say his <unk> expenses — but <unk> his weight in gold , ” said Richard .
“ He is such a <unk> fellow .
No <unk> about him .
<unk> and <unk> ! ” I certainly did not see the proof of Mr. Skimpole ’ s <unk> in his having his expenses paid by Richard , but I made no remark about that .
Indeed , he came in and turned our conversation .
He was charmed to see me , said he had been <unk> delicious tears of joy and sympathy at intervals for six weeks on my account , had never been so happy as in hearing of my progress , began to understand the mixture of good and evil in the world now , felt that he <unk> health the more when somebody else was ill , didn ’ t know but what it might be in the scheme of things that A should <unk> to make <unk> happier in looking straight or that <unk> should carry a wooden leg to make D better satisfied with his flesh and blood in a silk <unk> .
“ My dear Miss Summerson , here is our friend Richard , ” said Mr. Skimpole , “ full of the brightest <unk> of the future , which he <unk> out of the darkness of Chancery .
Now that ’ s delightful , that ’ s <unk> , that ’ s full of poetry !
In old times the woods and <unk> were made <unk> to the <unk> by the imaginary <unk> and dancing of <unk> and the <unk> .
This present <unk> , our <unk> Richard , <unk> the dull <unk> of Court by making <unk> and her train <unk> through them to the <unk> notes of a judgment from the bench .
That ’ s very pleasant , you know !
Some <unk> <unk> fellow may say to me , ‘ What ’ s the use of these legal and <unk> <unk> ?
How do you defend them ? ’ I reply , ‘ My <unk> friend , I DON ’ T defend them , but they are very agreeable to me .
There is a <unk> — youth , a friend of mine , who <unk> them into something highly fascinating to my simplicity .
I don ’ t say it is for this that they <unk> — for I am a child among you worldly <unk> , and not called upon to account to you or myself for anything — but it may be so . ’ ” I began seriously to think that Richard could scarcely have found a worse friend than this .
It made me uneasy that at such a time when he most required some right principle and purpose he should have this captivating <unk> and <unk> of everything , this airy <unk> with all principle and purpose , at his elbow .
I thought I could understand how such a nature as my guardian ’ s , experienced in the world and forced to contemplate the miserable <unk> and <unk> of the family misfortune , found an immense relief in Mr. Skimpole ’ s <unk> of his weaknesses and <unk> of <unk> candour ; but I could not satisfy myself that it was as <unk> as it seemed or that it did not serve Mr. Skimpole ’ s idle turn quite as well as any other part , and with less trouble .
They both walked back with me , and Mr. Skimpole leaving us at the gate , I walked softly in with Richard and said , “ Ada , my love , I have brought a gentleman to visit you . ” It was not difficult to read the blushing , startled face .
She loved him dearly , and he knew it , and I knew it .
It was a very <unk> business , that meeting as cousins only .
I almost <unk> myself as growing quite wicked in my suspicions , but I was not so sure that Richard loved her dearly .
He admired her very much — any one must have done that — and I dare say would have renewed their youthful engagement with great pride and ardour but that he knew how she would respect her promise to my guardian .
Still I had a <unk> idea that the influence upon him extended even here , that he was <unk> his best truth and earnestness in this as in all things until Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be off his mind .
Ah me !
What Richard would have been without that <unk> , I never shall know now !
He told Ada , in his most ingenuous way , that he had not come to make any secret <unk> on the terms she had accepted ( rather too <unk> and <unk> , he thought ) from Mr. Jarndyce , that he had come openly to see her and to see me and to <unk> himself for the present terms on which he stood with Mr. Jarndyce .
As the dear old infant would be with us directly , he begged that I would make an appointment for the morning , when he might set himself right through the means of an <unk> conversation with me .
I proposed to walk with him in the park at seven o ’ clock , and this was arranged .
Mr. Skimpole soon afterwards appeared and made us merry for an hour .
He particularly requested to see little Coavinses ( meaning Charley ) and told her , with a <unk> air , that he had given her late father all the business in his power and that if one of her little brothers would make haste to get set up in the same profession , he hoped he should still be able to put a good deal of employment in his way .
“ For I am constantly being taken in these <unk> , ” said Mr. Skimpole , looking <unk> at us over a glass of <unk> , “ and am constantly being <unk> out — like a <unk> .
Or paid off — like a ship ’ s company .
Somebody always does it for me .
I can ’ t do it , you know , for I never have any money .
But somebody does it .
I get out by somebody ’ s means ; I am not like the <unk> ; I get out .
If you were to ask me who somebody is , upon my word I couldn ’ t tell you .
Let us drink to somebody .
God bless him ! ” Richard was a little late in the morning , but I had not to wait for him long , and we turned into the park .
The air was bright and <unk> and the sky without a cloud .
The birds <unk> <unk> ; the <unk> in the fern , the grass , and trees , were <unk> to see ; the <unk> of the woods seemed to have increased <unk> since yesterday , as if , in the still night when they had looked so <unk> hushed in sleep , Nature , through all the minute details of every wonderful leaf , had been more <unk> than usual for the glory of that day .
“ This is a lovely place , ” said Richard , looking round .
“ None of the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> here ! ” But there was other trouble .
“ I tell you what , my dear girl , ” said Richard , “ when I get affairs in general settled , I shall come down here , I think , and rest . ” “ Would it not be better to rest now ? ” I asked .
“ Oh , as to resting <unk> , ” said Richard , “ or as to doing anything very <unk> <unk> , that ’ s not easy .
In short , it can ’ t be done ; I can ’ t do it at least . ” “ Why not ? ” said I.
“ You know why not , Esther .
If you were living in an unfinished house , liable to have the roof put on or taken off — to be from top to bottom pulled down or built up — to-morrow , next day , next week , next month , next year — you would find it hard to rest or settle .
So do I.
Now ?
There ’ s no now for us suitors . ” I could almost have believed in the attraction on which my poor little wandering friend had <unk> when I saw again the darkened look of last night .
<unk> to think it had in it also a shade of that unfortunate man who had died .
“ My dear Richard , ” said I , “ this is a bad beginning of our conversation . ” “ I knew you would tell me so , Dame Durden . ” “ And not I alone , dear Richard .
It was not I who <unk> you once never to found a hope or expectation on the family <unk> . ” “ There you come back to John Jarndyce ! ” said Richard <unk> .
“ Well !
We must approach him sooner or later , for he is the <unk> of what I have to say , and it ’ s as well at once .
My dear Esther , how can you be so blind ?
Don ’ t you see that he is an interested party and that it may be very well for him to wish me to know nothing of the suit , and care nothing about it , but that it may not be quite so well for me ? ” “ Oh , Richard , ” I remonstrated , “ is it possible that you can ever have seen him and heard him , that you can ever have lived under his roof and known him , and can yet breathe , even to me in this solitary place where there is no one to hear us , such <unk> suspicions ? ” He <unk> deeply , as if his natural generosity felt a <unk> of reproach .
He was silent for a little while before he replied in a subdued voice , “ Esther , I am sure you know that I am not a mean fellow and that I have some sense of suspicion and distrust being poor qualities in one of my years . ” “ I know it very well , ” said I.
“ I am not more sure of anything . ” “ That ’ s a dear girl , ” retorted Richard , “ and like you , because it gives me comfort .
I had need to get some scrap of comfort out of all this business , for it ’ s a bad one at the best , as I have no occasion to tell you . ” “ I know perfectly , ” said I.
“ I know as well , Richard — what shall I say ?
as well as you do — that such <unk> are foreign to your nature .
And I know , as well as you know , what so changes it . ” “ Come , sister , come , ” said Richard a little more gaily , “ you will be fair with me at all events .
If I have the misfortune to be under that influence , so has he .
If it has a little twisted me , it may have a little twisted him too .
I don ’ t say that he is not an honourable man , out of all this <unk> and <unk> ; I am sure he is .
But it <unk> everybody .
You know it <unk> everybody .
You have heard him say so fifty times .
Then why should HE escape ? ” “ Because , ” said I , “ his is an uncommon character , and he has <unk> kept himself outside the circle , Richard . ” “ Oh , because and because ! ” replied Richard in his vivacious way .
“ I am not sure , my dear girl , but that it may be wise and <unk> to preserve that outward indifference .
It may cause other parties interested to become <unk> about their interests ; and people may die off , and points may <unk> themselves out of memory , and many things may smoothly happen that are convenient enough . ” I was so touched with pity for Richard that I could not reproach him any more , even by a look .
I remembered my guardian ’ s gentleness towards his errors and with what perfect <unk> from <unk> he had spoken of them .
“ Esther , ” Richard resumed , “ you are not to suppose that I have come here to make <unk> charges against John Jarndyce .
I have only come to <unk> myself .
What I say is , it was all very well and we got on very well while I was a boy , utterly <unk> of this same suit ; but as soon as I began to take an interest in it and to look into it , then it was quite another thing .
Then John Jarndyce <unk> that Ada and I must break off and that if I don ’ t <unk> that very <unk> course , I am not fit for her .
Now , Esther , I don ’ t mean to <unk> that very <unk> course : I will not hold John Jarndyce ’ s favour on those <unk> terms of compromise , which he has no right to <unk> .
Whether it <unk> him or <unk> him , I must maintain my rights and Ada ’ s .
I have been thinking about it a good deal , and this is the conclusion I have come to . ” Poor dear Richard !
He had indeed been thinking about it a good deal .
His face , his voice , his manner , all showed that too plainly .
“ So I tell him <unk> ( you are to know I have written to him about all this ) that we are at <unk> and that we had better be at <unk> openly than <unk> .
I thank him for his <unk> and his protection , and he goes his road , and I go mine .
The fact is , our roads are not the same .
Under one of the wills in dispute , I should take much more than he .
I don ’ t mean to say that it is the one to be established , but there it is , and it has its chance . ” “ I have not to learn from you , my dear Richard , ” said I , “ of your letter .
I had heard of it already without an offended or angry word . ” “ Indeed ? ” replied Richard , <unk> .
“ I am glad I said he was an honourable man , out of all this wretched affair .
But I always say that and have never doubted it .
Now , my dear Esther , I know these views of mine appear extremely <unk> to you , and will to Ada when you tell her what has passed between us .
But if you had gone into the case as I have , if you had only applied yourself to the papers as I did when I was at Kenge ’ s , if you only knew what an <unk> of charges and <unk> , and suspicions and <unk> , they involve , you would think me <unk> in comparison . ” “ Perhaps so , ” said I.
“ But do you think that , among those many papers , there is much truth and justice , Richard ? ” “ There is truth and justice somewhere in the case , Esther — ” “ Or was once , long ago , ” said I.
“ Is — is — must be somewhere , ” pursued Richard <unk> , “ and must be brought out .
To allow Ada to be made a <unk> and <unk> of is not the way to bring it out .
You say the suit is changing me ; John Jarndyce says it changes , has changed , and will change everybody who has any share in it .
Then the greater right I have on my side when I resolve to do all I can to bring it to an end . ” “ All you can , Richard !
Do you think that in these many years no others have done all they could ?
Has the difficulty grown easier because of so many <unk> ? ” “ It can ’ t last for ever , ” returned Richard with a <unk> <unk> in him which again presented to me that last sad <unk> .
“ I am young and earnest , and energy and determination have done wonders many a time .
<unk> have only half thrown themselves into it .
I devote myself to it .
I make it the object of my life . ” “ Oh , Richard , my dear , so much the worse , so much the worse ! ” “ No , no , no , don ’ t you be afraid for me , ” he returned affectionately .
“ You ’ re a dear , good , wise , quiet , blessed girl ; but you have your <unk> .
So I come round to John Jarndyce .
I tell you , my good Esther , when he and I were on those terms which he found so convenient , we were not on natural terms . ” “ Are <unk> and <unk> your natural terms , Richard ? ” “ No , I don ’ t say that .
I mean that all this business puts us on unnatural terms , with which natural relations are <unk> .
See another reason for <unk> it on !
I may find out when it ’ s over that I have been mistaken in John Jarndyce .
My head may be clearer when I am free of it , and I may then agree with what you say to-day .
Very well .
Then I shall acknowledge it and make him <unk> . ” Everything <unk> to that imaginary time !
Everything held in confusion and indecision until then !
“ Now , my best of <unk> , ” said Richard , “ I want my cousin Ada to understand that I am not <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> about John Jarndyce , but that I have this purpose and reason at my back .
I wish to represent myself to her through you , because she has a great esteem and respect for her cousin John ; and I know you will soften the course I take , even though you <unk> of it ; and — and in short , ” said Richard , who had been hesitating through these words , “ I — I don ’ t like to represent myself in this <unk> , <unk> , <unk> character to a confiding girl like Ada . ” I told him that he was more like himself in those latter words than in anything he had said yet .
“ Why , ” acknowledged Richard , “ that may be true enough , my love .
I rather feel it to be so .
But I shall be able to give myself <unk> by and by .
I shall come all right again , then , don ’ t you be afraid . ” I asked him if this were all he wished me to tell Ada .
“ Not quite , ” said Richard .
“ I am bound not to <unk> from her that John Jarndyce answered my letter in his usual manner , addressing me as ‘ My dear Rick , ’ trying to <unk> me out of my opinions , and telling me that they should make no difference in him .
( All very well of course , but not <unk> the case . )
I also want Ada to know that if I see her seldom just now , I am looking after her interests as well as my own — we two being in the same <unk> exactly — and that I hope she will not suppose from any flying <unk> she may hear that I am at all <unk> or <unk> ; on the contrary , I am always looking forward to the termination of the suit , and always <unk> in that direction .
Being of age now and having taken the step I have taken , I consider myself free from any <unk> to John Jarndyce ; but Ada being still a ward of the court , I don ’ t yet ask her to renew our engagement .
When she is free to act for herself , I shall be myself once more and we shall both be in very different worldly circumstances , I believe .
If you tell her all this with the advantage of your considerate way , you will do me a very great and a very kind service , my dear Esther ; and I shall knock Jarndyce and Jarndyce on the head with greater <unk> .
Of course I ask for no secrecy at Bleak House . ” “ Richard , ” said I , “ you place great confidence in me , but I fear you will not take advice from me ? ” “ It ’ s impossible that I can on this subject , my dear girl .
On any other , readily . ” As if there were any other in his life !
As if his whole career and character were not being <unk> one colour !
“ But I may ask you a question , Richard ? ” “ I think so , ” said he , laughing .
“ I don ’ t know who may not , if you may not . ” “ You say , yourself , you are not leading a very settled life . ” “ How can I , my dear Esther , with nothing settled ! ” “ Are you in debt again ? ” “ Why , of course I am , ” said Richard , astonished at my simplicity .
“ Is it of course ? ” “ My dear child , certainly .
I can ’ t throw myself into an object so completely without expense .
You forget , or perhaps you don ’ t know , that under either of the wills Ada and I take something .
It ’ s only a question between the larger sum and the smaller .
I shall be within the mark any way .
Bless your heart , my excellent girl , ” said Richard , quite amused with me , “ I shall be all right !
I shall pull through , my dear ! ” I felt so deeply sensible of the danger in which he stood that I tried , in Ada ’ s name , in my guardian ’ s , in my own , by every <unk> means that I could think of , to warn him of it and to show him some of his mistakes .
He received everything I said with patience and gentleness , but it all <unk> from him without taking the least effect .
I could not wonder at this after the reception his <unk> mind had given to my guardian ’ s letter , but I determined to try Ada ’ s influence yet .
So when our walk brought us round to the village again , and I went home to breakfast , I prepared Ada for the account I was going to give her and told her exactly what reason we had to dread that Richard was losing himself and <unk> his whole life to the winds .
It made her very unhappy , of course , though she had a far , far greater reliance on his correcting his errors than I could have — which was so natural and loving in my dear ! — and she presently wrote him this little letter : My dearest cousin , Esther has told me all you said to her this morning .
I write this to repeat most earnestly for myself all that she said to you and to let you know how sure I am that you will sooner or later find our cousin John a pattern of truth , <unk> , and goodness , when you will deeply , deeply <unk> to have done him ( without <unk> it ) so much wrong .
I do not quite know how to write what I wish to say next , but I trust you will understand it as I mean it .
I have some fears , my dearest cousin , that it may be partly for my sake you are now laying up so much <unk> for yourself — and if for yourself , for me .
In case this should be so , or in case you should entertain much thought of me in what you are doing , I most earnestly entreat and beg you to <unk> .
You can do nothing for my sake that will make me half so happy as for ever turning your back upon the shadow in which we both were born .
Do not be angry with me for saying this .
Pray , pray , dear Richard , for my sake , and for your own , and in a natural <unk> for that source of trouble which had its share in making us both <unk> when we were very young , pray , pray , let it go for ever .
We have reason to know by this time that there is no good in it and no hope , that there is nothing to be got from it but sorrow .
My dearest cousin , it is <unk> for me to say that you are quite free and that it is very likely you may find some one whom you will love much better than your first fancy .
I am quite sure , if you will let me say so , that the object of your choice would greatly prefer to follow your fortunes far and wide , however <unk> or poor , and see you happy , doing your duty and pursuing your chosen way , than to have the hope of being , or even to be , very rich with you ( if such a thing were possible ) at the cost of dragging years of <unk> and anxiety and of your indifference to other <unk> .
You may wonder at my saying this so confidently with so little knowledge or experience , but I know it for a certainty from my own heart .
<unk> , my dearest cousin , your most affectionate Ada This note brought Richard to us very soon , but it made little change in him if any .
We would <unk> try , he said , who was right and who was wrong — he would show us — we should see !
He was animated and glowing , as if Ada ’ s tenderness had gratified him ; but I could only hope , with a sigh , that the letter might have some stronger effect upon his mind on <unk> than it assuredly had then .
As they were to remain with us that day and had taken their places to return by the coach next morning , I sought an opportunity of speaking to Mr. Skimpole .
Our <unk> life easily threw one in my way , and I delicately said that there was a responsibility in encouraging Richard .
“ <unk> , my dear Miss Summerson ? ” he repeated , catching at the word with the pleasantest smile .
“ I am the last man in the world for such a thing .
I never was responsible in my life — I can ’ t be . ” “ I am afraid everybody is obliged to be , ” said I timidly enough , he being so much older and more clever than I.
“ No , really ? ” said Mr. Skimpole , receiving this new light with a most agreeable <unk> of surprise .
“ But every man ’ s not obliged to be <unk> ?
I am not .
I never was .
See , my dear Miss Summerson , ” he took a <unk> of loose silver and halfpence from his pocket , “ there ’ s so much money .
I have not an idea how much .
I have not the power of <unk> .
Call it four and <unk> — call it four pound nine .
They tell me I owe more than that .
I dare say I do .
I dare say I owe as much as <unk> people will let me owe .
If they don ’ t stop , why should I ?
There you have Harold Skimpole in little .
If that ’ s responsibility , I am responsible . ” The perfect ease of manner with which he put the money up again and looked at me with a smile on his <unk> face , as if he had been mentioning a curious little fact about somebody else , almost made me feel as if he really had nothing to do with it .
“ Now , when you mention responsibility , ” he resumed , “ I am disposed to say that I never had the happiness of knowing any one whom I should consider so <unk> responsible as yourself .
You appear to me to be the very <unk> of responsibility .
When I see you , my dear Miss Summerson , intent upon the perfect working of the whole little orderly system of which you are the centre , I feel inclined to say to myself — in fact I do say to myself very often — THAT ’ S responsibility ! ” It was difficult , after this , to explain what I meant ; but I <unk> so far as to say that we all hoped he would check and not confirm Richard in the sanguine views he entertained just then .
“ Most willingly , ” he retorted , “ if I could .
But , my dear Miss Summerson , I have no art , no <unk> .
If he takes me by the hand and leads me through Westminster Hall in an airy procession after fortune , I must go .
If he says , ‘ Skimpole , join the dance ! ’ I must join it .
<unk> sense wouldn ’ t , I know , but I have NO common sense . ” It was very unfortunate for Richard , I said .
“ Do you think so ! ” returned Mr. Skimpole .
“ Don ’ t say that , don ’ t say that .
Let us suppose him keeping company with <unk> <unk> — an excellent man — a good deal <unk> — dreadfully practical — change for a <unk> note in every pocket — <unk> <unk> in his hand — say , upon the whole , <unk> a <unk> .
Our dear Richard , sanguine , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , bursting with poetry like a young <unk> , says to this highly respectable companion , ‘ I see a golden prospect before me ; it ’ s very bright , it ’ s very beautiful , it ’ s very <unk> ; here I go , <unk> over the landscape to come at it ! ’ The respectable companion instantly knocks him down with the <unk> <unk> ; tells him in a literal , <unk> way that he sees no such thing ; shows him it ’ s nothing but fees , <unk> , <unk> wigs , and black gowns .
Now you know that ’ s a painful change — sensible in the last degree , I have no doubt , but disagreeable .
I can ’ t do it .
I haven ’ t got the <unk> <unk> , I have none of the <unk> <unk> in my composition , I am not at all respectable , and I don ’ t want to be .
<unk> perhaps , but so it is ! ” It was idle to say more , so I proposed that we should join Ada and Richard , who were a little in advance , and I gave up Mr. Skimpole in despair .
He had been over the Hall in the course of the morning and <unk> described the family pictures as we walked .
There were such <unk> <unk> among the <unk> Dedlock dead and gone , he told us , that peaceful <unk> became weapons of <unk> in their hands .
They <unk> their <unk> severely in <unk> and powder and put their <unk> <unk> on to <unk> <unk> as the <unk> of some other <unk> put on their <unk> .
There was a Sir Somebody Dedlock , with a <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> of smoke , <unk> of lightning , a town on fire , and a <unk> <unk> , all in full action between his horse ’ s two <unk> legs , showing , he supposed , how little a Dedlock made of such <unk> .
The whole race he represented as having evidently been , in life , what he called “ stuffed people ” — a large collection , <unk> eyed , set up in the most <unk> manner on their various <unk> and <unk> , very correct , perfectly free from animation , and always in glass cases .
I was not so easy now during any reference to the name but that I felt it a relief when Richard , with an exclamation of surprise , hurried away to meet a stranger whom he first <unk> coming slowly towards us .
“ Dear me ! ” said Mr. Skimpole .
“ Vholes ! ” We asked if that were a friend of Richard ’ s .
“ <unk> and legal adviser , ” said Mr. Skimpole .
“ Now , my dear Miss Summerson , if you want common sense , responsibility , and respectability , all united — if you want an exemplary man — Vholes is THE man . ” We had not known , we said , that Richard was assisted by any gentleman of that name .
“ When he <unk> from legal <unk> , ” returned Mr. Skimpole , “ he parted from our <unk> friend Kenge and took up , I believe , with Vholes .
Indeed , I know he did , because I <unk> him to Vholes . ” “ <unk> you known him long ? ” asked Ada .
“ Vholes ?
My dear Miss Clare , I had had that kind of acquaintance with him which I have had with several gentlemen of his profession .
He had done something or other in a very agreeable , <unk> manner — taken proceedings , I think , is the expression — which ended in the proceeding of his taking ME .
Somebody was so good as to step in and pay the money — something and <unk> was the amount ; I forget the pounds and shillings , but I know it ended with <unk> , because it struck me at the time as being so odd that I could owe anybody <unk> — and after that I brought them together .
Vholes asked me for the introduction , and I gave it .
Now I come to think of it , ” he looked inquiringly at us with his <unk> smile as he made the discovery , “ Vholes <unk> me , perhaps ?
He gave me something and called it commission .
Was it a <unk> note ?
Do you know , I think it MUST have been a <unk> note ! ” His further consideration of the point was prevented by Richard ’ s coming back to us in an excited state and hastily <unk> Mr. Vholes — a sallow man with pinched lips that looked as if they were cold , a red <unk> here and there upon his face , tall and thin , about fifty years of age , high-shouldered , and stooping .
<unk> in black , <unk> , and buttoned to the chin , there was nothing so remarkable in him as a <unk> manner and a slow , fixed way he had of looking at Richard .
“ I hope I don ’ t disturb you , ladies , ” said Mr. Vholes , and now I observed that he was further remarkable for an inward manner of speaking .
“ I arranged with Mr. Carstone that he should always know when his cause was in the Chancellor ’ s paper , and being informed by one of my clerks last night after post time that it stood , rather unexpectedly , in the paper for to-morrow , I put myself into the coach early this morning and came down to confer with him . ” “ Yes , ” said Richard , flushed , and looking triumphantly at Ada and me , “ we don ’ t do these things in the old slow way now .
We <unk> along now !
Mr. Vholes , we must <unk> something to get over to the post town in , and catch the <unk> to-night , and go up by it ! ” “ Anything you please , sir , ” returned Mr. Vholes .
“ I am quite at your service . ” “ Let me see , ” said Richard , looking at his watch .
“ If I run down to the Dedlock , and get my portmanteau fastened up , and order a gig , or a chaise , or whatever ’ s to be got , we shall have an hour then before starting .
I ’ ll come back to tea .
Cousin Ada , will you and Esther take care of Mr. Vholes when I am gone ? ” He was away directly , in his heat and hurry , and was soon lost in the dusk of evening .
We who were left walked on towards the house .
“ Is Mr. Carstone ’ s presence necessary to-morrow , Sir ? ” said I.
“ Can it do any good ? ” “ No , miss , ” Mr. Vholes replied .
“ I am not aware that it can . ” Both Ada and I expressed our regret that he should go , then , only to be disappointed .
“ Mr.
Carstone has laid down the principle of watching his own interests , ” said Mr. Vholes , “ and when a client lays down his own principle , and it is not <unk> , it <unk> upon me to carry it out .
I wish in business to be exact and open .
I am a <unk> with three daughters — Emma , Jane , and Caroline — and my desire is so to discharge the duties of life as to leave them a good name .
This appears to be a pleasant spot , miss . ” The remark being made to me in consequence of my being next him as we walked , I assented and <unk> its chief attractions .
“ Indeed ? ” said Mr. Vholes .
“ I have the privilege of <unk> an aged father in the Vale of Taunton — his native place — and I admire that country very much .
I had no idea there was anything so <unk> here . ” To keep up the conversation , I asked Mr. Vholes if he would like to live altogether in the country .
“ There , miss , ” said he , “ you touch me on a tender <unk> .
My health is not good ( my digestion being much <unk> ) , and if I had only myself to consider , I should take refuge in <unk> habits , especially as the cares of business have prevented me from ever coming much into contact with general society , and particularly with ladies ’ society , which I have most wished to <unk> in .
But with my three daughters , Emma , Jane , and Caroline — and my aged father — I cannot afford to be selfish .
It is true I have no longer to maintain a dear grandmother who died in her hundred and second year , but enough remains to render it <unk> that the mill should be always going . ” It required some attention to hear him on account of his inward speaking and his <unk> manner .
“ You will excuse my having mentioned my daughters , ” he said .
“ They are my weak point .
I wish to leave the poor girls some little independence , as well as a good name . ” We now arrived at Mr. Boythorn ’ s house , where the <unk> , all prepared , was <unk> us .
Richard came in restless and hurried shortly afterwards , and leaning over Mr. Vholes ’ s chair , whispered something in his ear .
Mr. Vholes replied aloud — or as nearly aloud I suppose as he had ever replied to anything — “ You will drive me , will you , sir ?
It is all the same to me , sir .
Anything you please .
I am quite at your service . ” We understood from what followed that Mr. Skimpole was to be left until the morning to occupy the two places which had been already paid for .
As Ada and I were both in low spirits concerning Richard and very sorry so to part with him , we made it as plain as we politely could that we should leave Mr. Skimpole to the Dedlock Arms and retire when the <unk> were gone .
Richard ’ s high spirits carrying everything before them , we all went out together to the top of the hill above the village , where he had <unk> a gig to wait and where we found a man with a lantern standing at the head of the gaunt pale horse that had been <unk> to it .
I never shall forget those two seated side by side in the lantern ’ s light , Richard all flush and fire and laughter , with the <unk> in his hand ; Mr. Vholes quite still , <unk> , and buttoned up , looking at him as if he were looking at his prey and charming it .
I have before me the whole picture of the warm dark night , the summer lightning , the dusty track of road closed in by <unk> and high trees , the gaunt pale horse with his ears <unk> up , and the <unk> away at speed to Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
My dear girl told me that night how Richard ’ s being <unk> prosperous or ruined , <unk> or deserted , could only make this difference to her , that the more he needed love from one <unk> heart , the more love that <unk> heart would have to give him ; how he thought of her through his present errors , and she would think of him at all times — never of herself if she could devote herself to him , never of her own <unk> if she could <unk> to his .
And she kept her word ?
I look along the road before me , where the distance already <unk> and the journey ’ s end is growing visible ; and true and good above the dead sea of the Chancery suit and all the <unk> fruit it cast <unk> , I think I see my darling .
CHAPTER <unk> A <unk> When our time came for returning to Bleak House again , we were punctual to the day and were received with an <unk> welcome .
I was perfectly restored to health and strength , and finding my housekeeping keys laid ready for me in my room , rang myself in as if I had been a new year , with a merry little <unk> .
“ Once more , duty , duty , Esther , ” said I ; “ and if you are not <unk> to do it , more than cheerfully and <unk> , through anything and everything , you ought to be .
That ’ s all I have to say to you , my dear ! ” The first few <unk> were <unk> of so much bustle and business , devoted to such <unk> of accounts , such repeated <unk> to and fro between the growlery and all other parts of the house , so many <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and such a general new beginning altogether , that I had not a moment ’ s leisure .
But when these arrangements were completed and everything was in order , I paid a visit of a few hours to London , which something in the letter I had destroyed at Chesney Wold had induced me to decide upon in my own mind .
I made Caddy Jellyby — her <unk> name was so natural to me that I always called her by it — the <unk> for this visit and wrote her a note previously asking the favour of her company on a little business expedition .
Leaving home very early in the morning , I got to London by <unk> in such good time that I got to Newman Street with the day before me .
Caddy , who had not seen me since her <unk> , was so glad and so affectionate that I was half inclined to fear I should make her husband jealous .
But he was , in his way , just as bad — I mean as good ; and in short it was the old story , and nobody would leave me any possibility of doing anything <unk> .
The elder Mr. Turveydrop was in bed , I found , and Caddy was <unk> his <unk> , which a melancholy little boy who was an <unk> — it seemed such a curious thing to be <unk> to the trade of dancing — was waiting to carry upstairs .
Her <unk> was extremely kind and considerate , Caddy told me , and they lived most happily together .
( When she spoke of their living together , she meant that the old gentleman had all the good things and all the good lodging , while she and her husband had what they could get , and were <unk> into two corner rooms over the <unk> . )
“ And how is your mama , Caddy ? ” said I.
“ Why , I hear of her , Esther , ” replied Caddy , “ through Pa , but I see very little of her .
We are good friends , I am glad to say , but Ma thinks there is something absurd in my having married a <unk> , and she is rather afraid of its <unk> to her . ” It struck me that if Mrs. Jellyby had discharged her own natural duties and obligations before she <unk> the <unk> with a <unk> in search of others , she would have taken the best precautions against becoming absurd , but I need scarcely observe that I kept this to myself .
“ And your papa , Caddy ? ” “ He comes here every evening , ” returned Caddy , “ and is so fond of sitting in the corner there that it ’ s a <unk> to see him . ” <unk> at the corner , I plainly perceived the mark of Mr. Jellyby ’ s head against the wall .
It was <unk> to know that he had found such a <unk> for it .
“ And you , Caddy , ” said I , “ you are always busy , I ’ ll be bound ? ” “ Well , my dear , ” returned Caddy , “ I am indeed , for to tell you a grand secret , I am <unk> myself to give <unk> .
Prince ’ s health is not strong , and I want to be able to assist him .
What with <unk> , and classes here , and private pupils , AND the apprentices , he really has too much to do , poor fellow ! ” The <unk> of the apprentices was still so odd to me that I asked Caddy if there were many of them .
“ <unk> , ” said Caddy .
“ One <unk> , and three out .
They are very good children ; only when they get together they WILL play — <unk> — instead of attending to their work .
So the little boy you saw just now <unk> by himself in the empty kitchen , and we distribute the others over the house as well as we can . ” “ That is only for their steps , of course ? ” said I.
“ Only for their steps , ” said Caddy .
“ In that way they <unk> , so many hours at a time , whatever steps they happen to be upon .
They dance in the academy , and at this time of year we do figures at five every morning . ” “ Why , what a <unk> life ! ” I exclaimed .
“ I assure you , my dear , ” returned Caddy , smiling , “ when the <unk> apprentices ring us up in the morning ( the bell rings into our room , not to disturb old Mr. Turveydrop ) , and when I put up the window and see them standing on the door-step with their little <unk> under their arms , I am actually reminded of the <unk> . ” All this presented the art to me in a singular light , to be sure .
Caddy enjoyed the effect of her communication and cheerfully <unk> the particulars of her own studies .
“ You see , my dear , to save expense I ought to know something of the piano , and I ought to know something of the kit too , and consequently I have to <unk> those two <unk> as well as the details of our profession .
If Ma had been like anybody else , I might have had some little musical knowledge to begin upon .
However , I hadn ’ t any ; and that part of the work is , at first , a little <unk> , I must allow .
But I have a very good ear , and I am used to <unk> — I have to thank Ma for that , at all events — and where there ’ s a will there ’ s a way , you know , Esther , the world over . ” <unk> these words , Caddy laughingly sat down at a little <unk> square piano and really rattled off a <unk> with great spirit .
Then she good-humouredly and <unk> got up again , and while she still laughed herself , said , “ Don ’ t laugh at me , please ; that ’ s a dear girl ! ” I would sooner have cried , but I did neither .
I encouraged her and praised her with all my heart .
For I <unk> believed , <unk> ’ s wife though she was , and <unk> though in her limited ambition she aspired to be , she had struck out a natural , wholesome , loving course of <unk> and perseverance that was quite as good as a mission .
“ My dear , ” said Caddy , delighted , “ you can ’ t think how you cheer me .
I shall owe you , you don ’ t know how much .
What changes , Esther , even in my small world !
You recollect that first night , when I was so <unk> and inky ?
Who would have thought , then , of my ever teaching people to dance , of all other <unk> and <unk> ! ” Her husband , who had left us while we had this <unk> , now coming back , <unk> to <unk> the apprentices in the <unk> , Caddy informed me she was quite at my disposal .
But it was not my time yet , I was glad to tell her , for I should have been <unk> to take her away then .
Therefore we three <unk> to the apprentices together , and I made one in the dance .
The apprentices were the <unk> little people .
Besides the melancholy boy , who , I hoped , had not been made so by <unk> alone in the empty kitchen , there were two other boys and one dirty little limp girl in a <unk> dress .
Such a <unk> little girl , with such a <unk> bonnet on ( that , too , of a <unk> <unk> ) , who brought her <unk> shoes in an old threadbare velvet reticule .
Such mean little boys , when they were not dancing , with <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> in their pockets , and the most untidy legs and feet — and heels particularly .
I asked Caddy what had made their parents choose this profession for them .
Caddy said she didn ’ t know ; perhaps they were <unk> for <unk> , perhaps for the stage .
They were all people in humble circumstances , and the melancholy boy ’ s mother kept a <unk> shop .
We <unk> for an hour with great gravity , the melancholy child doing wonders with his lower <unk> , in which there appeared to be some sense of enjoyment though it never rose above his waist .
Caddy , while she was observant of her husband and was evidently founded upon him , had acquired a grace and <unk> of her own , which , united to her pretty face and figure , was uncommonly agreeable .
She already relieved him of much of the <unk> of these young people , and he seldom <unk> except to walk his part in the figure if he had anything to do in it .
He always played the tune .
The <unk> of the <unk> child , and her condescension to the boys , was a sight .
And thus we <unk> an hour by the clock .
When the practice was concluded , Caddy ’ s husband made himself ready to go out of town to a school , and Caddy ran away to get ready to go out with me .
I sat in the <unk> in the interval , contemplating the apprentices .
The two <unk> boys went upon the staircase to put on their <unk> and pull the <unk> boy ’ s hair , as I <unk> from the nature of his objections .
<unk> with their <unk> buttoned and their <unk> <unk> in them , they then produced <unk> of cold bread and <unk> and <unk> under a painted <unk> on the wall .
The little <unk> child , having <unk> her <unk> into the reticule and put on a <unk> pair of shoes , shook her head into the <unk> bonnet at one shake , and answering my inquiry whether she liked dancing by replying , “ Not with boys , ” tied it across her chin , and went home <unk> .
“ Old Mr. Turveydrop is so sorry , ” said Caddy , “ that he has not finished <unk> yet and cannot have the pleasure of seeing you before you go .
You are such a favourite of his , Esther . ” I expressed myself much obliged to him , but did not think it necessary to add that I readily dispensed with this attention .
“ It takes him a long time to dress , ” said Caddy , “ because he is very much looked up to in such things , you know , and has a reputation to support .
You can ’ t think how kind he is to Pa .
He talks to Pa of an evening about the Prince Regent , and I never saw Pa so interested . ” There was something in the picture of Mr. Turveydrop <unk> his deportment on Mr. Jellyby that quite took my fancy .
I asked Caddy if he brought her papa out much .
“ No , ” said Caddy , “ I don ’ t know that he does that , but he talks to Pa , and Pa greatly <unk> him , and listens , and likes it .
Of course I am aware that Pa has hardly any claims to deportment , but they get on together <unk> .
You can ’ t think what good companions they make .
I never saw Pa take snuff before in my life , but he takes one pinch out of Mr. Turveydrop ’ s box regularly and keeps putting it to his nose and taking it away again all the evening . ” That old Mr. Turveydrop should ever , in the chances and changes of life , have come to the <unk> of Mr. Jellyby from Borrioboola-Gha appeared to me to be one of the pleasantest of <unk> .
“ As to Peepy , ” said Caddy with a little hesitation , “ whom I was most afraid of — next to having any family of my own , Esther — as an inconvenience to Mr. Turveydrop , the kindness of the old gentleman to that child is beyond everything .
He asks to see him , my dear !
He lets him take the newspaper up to him in bed ; he gives him the <unk> of his toast to eat ; he sends him on little <unk> about the house ; he tells him to come to me for <unk> .
In short , ” said Caddy <unk> , “ and not to prose , I am a very fortunate girl and ought to be very grateful .
Where are we going , Esther ? ” “ To the Old Street Road , ” said I , “ where I have a few words to say to the solicitor ’ s clerk who was sent to meet me at the <unk> on the very day when I came to London and first saw you , my dear .
Now I think of it , the gentleman who brought us to your house . ” “ Then , indeed , I seem to be naturally the person to go with you , ” returned Caddy .
To the Old Street Road we went and there inquired at Mrs. Guppy ’ s residence for Mrs. Guppy .
Mrs. Guppy , <unk> the <unk> and having indeed been <unk> in danger of <unk> herself like a <unk> in the <unk> door by peeping out before she was asked for , immediately presented herself and requested us to walk in .
She was an old lady in a large cap , with rather a red nose and rather an <unk> eye , but smiling all over .
Her close little sitting-room was prepared for a visit , and there was a portrait of her son in it which , I had almost written here , was more like than life : it <unk> upon him with such <unk> , and was so determined not to let him off .
Not only was the portrait there , but we found the original there too .
He was dressed in a great many colours and was discovered at a table reading <unk> with his forefinger to his forehead .
“ Miss Summerson , ” said Mr. Guppy , rising , “ this is indeed an <unk> .
Mother , will you be so good as to put a chair for the other lady and get out of the <unk> . ” Mrs. Guppy , whose <unk> smiling gave her quite a <unk> appearance , did as her son requested and then sat down in a corner , holding her pocket handkerchief to her chest , like a <unk> , with both hands .
I presented Caddy , and Mr. Guppy said that any friend of mine was more than welcome .
I then proceeded to the object of my visit .
“ I took the liberty of sending you a note , sir , ” said I. Mr. Guppy acknowledged the receipt by taking it out of his <unk> , putting it to his lips , and returning it to his pocket with a bow .
Mr. Guppy ’ s mother was so <unk> that she rolled her head as she smiled and made a silent appeal to Caddy with her elbow .
“ Could I speak to you alone for a moment ? ” said I.
Anything like the <unk> of Mr. Guppy ’ s mother just now , I think I never saw .
She made no sound of laughter , but she rolled her head , and shook it , and put her handkerchief to her mouth , and <unk> to Caddy with her elbow , and her hand , and her shoulder , and was so <unk> entertained altogether that it was with some difficulty she could <unk> Caddy through the little <unk> into her bedroom adjoining .
“ Miss Summerson , ” said Mr. Guppy , “ you will excuse the <unk> of a parent ever <unk> of a son ’ s <unk> .
My mother , though highly <unk> to the feelings , is <unk> by <unk> <unk> . ” I could hardly have believed that anybody could in a moment have turned so red or changed so much as Mr. Guppy did when I now put up my veil .
“ I asked the favour of seeing you for a few moments here , ” said I , “ in <unk> to calling at Mr. Kenge ’ s because , remembering what you said on an occasion when you spoke to me in confidence , I feared I might otherwise cause you some embarrassment , Mr. Guppy . ” I caused him embarrassment enough as it was , I am sure .
I never saw such <unk> , such confusion , such amazement and apprehension .
“ Miss Summerson , ” <unk> Mr. Guppy , “ I — I — beg your pardon , but in our profession — we — we — find it necessary to be <unk> .
You have referred to an occasion , miss , when I — when I did myself the honour of making a declaration which — ” Something seemed to rise in his throat that he could not possibly <unk> .
He put his hand there , <unk> , made faces , tried again to <unk> it , <unk> again , made faces again , looked all round the room , and fluttered his papers .
“ A kind of giddy sensation has come upon me , miss , ” he explained , “ which rather knocks me over .
I — er — a little subject to this sort of thing — er — by George ! ” I gave him a little time to recover .
He consumed it in putting his hand to his forehead and taking it away again , and in <unk> his chair into the corner behind him .
“ My intention was to remark , miss , ” said Mr. Guppy , “ dear me — something <unk> , I think — <unk> ! — to remark that you was so good on that occasion as to <unk> and <unk> that declaration .
You — you wouldn ’ t perhaps object to admit that ?
Though no witnesses are present , it might be a satisfaction to — to your mind — if you was to put in that admission . ” “ There can be no doubt , ” said I , “ that I <unk> your proposal without any reservation or <unk> whatever , Mr. Guppy . ” “ Thank you , miss , ” he returned , <unk> the table with his troubled hands .
“ So far that ’ s satisfactory , and it does you credit .
<unk> — this is certainly <unk> ! — must be in the <unk> — er — you wouldn ’ t perhaps be offended if I was to mention — not that it ’ s necessary , for your own good sense or any person ’ s sense must show ’ em that — if I was to mention that such declaration on my part was final , and there terminated ? ” “ I quite understand that , ” said I.
“ Perhaps — er — it may not be worth the form , but it might be a satisfaction to your mind — perhaps you wouldn ’ t object to admit that , miss ? ” said Mr. Guppy .
“ I admit it most fully and freely , ” said I.
“ Thank you , ” returned Mr. Guppy .
“ Very honourable , I am sure .
I regret that my arrangements in life , combined with circumstances over which I have no control , will put it out of my power ever to fall back upon that offer or to renew it in any shape or form whatever , but it will ever be a <unk> <unk> — er — with friendship ’ s <unk> . ” Mr. Guppy ’ s <unk> came to his relief and stopped his <unk> of the table .
“ I may now perhaps mention what I wished to say to you ? ” I began .
“ I shall be honoured , I am sure , ” said Mr. Guppy .
“ I am so persuaded that your own good sense and right feeling , miss , will — will keep you as square as possible — that I can have nothing but pleasure , I am sure , in hearing any observations you may wish to offer . ” “ You were so good as to <unk> , on that occasion — ” “ Excuse me , miss , ” said Mr. Guppy , “ but we had better not travel out of the <unk> into <unk> .
I cannot admit that I <unk> anything . ” “ You said on that occasion , ” I <unk> , “ that you might possibly have the means of advancing my interests and <unk> my fortunes by making <unk> of which I should be the subject .
I presume that you founded that belief upon your general knowledge of my being an orphan girl , <unk> for everything to the benevolence of Mr. Jarndyce .
Now , the beginning and the end of what I have come to beg of you is , Mr. Guppy , that you will have the kindness to <unk> all idea of so <unk> me .
I have thought of this sometimes , and I have thought of it most lately — since I have been ill . At length I have decided , in case you should at any time recall that purpose and act upon it in any way , to come to you and assure you that you are altogether mistaken .
You could make no discovery in reference to me that would do me the least service or give me the least pleasure .
I am acquainted with my personal history , and I have it in my power to assure you that you never can advance my welfare by such means .
You may , perhaps , have abandoned this project a long time .
If so , excuse my giving you unnecessary trouble .
If not , I entreat you , on the assurance I have given you , henceforth to lay it aside .
I beg you to do this , for my peace . ” “ I am bound to confess , ” said Mr. Guppy , “ that you express yourself , miss , with that good sense and right feeling for which I gave you credit .
Nothing can be more satisfactory than such right feeling , and if I <unk> any intentions on your part just now , I am prepared to tender a full apology .
I should wish to be understood , miss , as <unk> offering that apology — <unk> it , as your own good sense and right feeling will point out the necessity of , to the present proceedings . ” I must say for Mr. Guppy that the <unk> manner he had had upon him improved very much .
He seemed truly glad to be able to do something I asked , and he looked ashamed .
“ If you will allow me to finish what I have to say at once so that I may have no occasion to resume , ” I went on , seeing him about to speak , “ you will do me a kindness , sir .
I come to you as <unk> as possible because you announced this impression of yours to me in a confidence which I have really wished to respect — and which I always have respected , as you remember .
I have mentioned my illness .
There really is no reason why I should <unk> to say that I know very well that any little delicacy I might have had in making a request to you is quite removed .
Therefore I make the entreaty I have now <unk> , and I hope you will have sufficient consideration for me to <unk> to it . ” I must do Mr. Guppy the further justice of saying that he had looked more and more ashamed and that he looked most ashamed and very earnest when he now replied with a burning face , “ Upon my word and honour , upon my life , upon my soul , Miss Summerson , as I am a living man , I ’ ll act according to your wish !
I ’ ll never go another step in opposition to it .
I ’ ll take my oath to it if it will be any satisfaction to you .
In what I promise at this present time touching the matters now in question , ” continued Mr. Guppy rapidly , as if he were repeating a familiar form of words , “ I speak the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so — ” “ I am quite satisfied , ” said I , rising at this point , “ and I thank you very much .
Caddy , my dear , I am ready ! ” Mr. Guppy ’ s mother returned with Caddy ( now making me the <unk> of her silent laughter and her <unk> ) , and we took our leave .
Mr. Guppy saw us to the door with the air of one who was either imperfectly awake or walking in his sleep ; and we left him there , staring .
But in a minute he came after us down the street without any hat , and with his long hair all blown about , and stopped us , saying <unk> , “ Miss Summerson , upon my honour and soul , you may depend upon me ! ” “ I do , ” said I , “ quite confidently . ” “ I beg your pardon , miss , ” said Mr. Guppy , going with one leg and staying with the other , “ but this lady being present — your own witness — it might be a satisfaction to your mind ( which I should wish to set at rest ) if you was to repeat those <unk> . ” “ Well , Caddy , ” said I , turning to her , “ perhaps you will not be surprised when I tell you , my dear , that there never has been any engagement — ” “ No proposal or promise of marriage whatsoever , ” suggested Mr. Guppy .
“ No proposal or promise of marriage whatsoever , ” said I , “ between this gentleman — ” “ William Guppy , of <unk> Place , <unk> , in the county of <unk> , ” he murmured .
“ Between this gentleman , Mr. William Guppy , of <unk> Place , <unk> , in the county of <unk> , and myself . ” “ Thank you , miss , ” said Mr. Guppy .
“ Very full — er — excuse me — lady ’ s name , Christian and <unk> both ? ” I gave them .
“ <unk> woman , I believe ? ” said Mr. Guppy .
“ <unk> woman .
Thank you .
<unk> Caroline Jellyby , <unk> , then of Thavies Inn , within the city of London , but <unk> ; now of Newman Street , <unk> Street .
Much obliged . ” He ran home and came running back again .
“ <unk> that matter , you know , I really and truly am very sorry that my arrangements in life , combined with circumstances over which I have no control , should prevent a <unk> of what was wholly terminated some time back , ” said Mr. Guppy to me <unk> and <unk> , “ but it couldn ’ t be .
Now <unk> it , you know !
I only put it to you . ” I replied it certainly could not .
The subject did not admit of a doubt .
He thanked me and ran to his mother ’ s again — and back again .
“ It ’ s very honourable of you , miss , I am sure , ” said Mr. Guppy .
“ If an <unk> could be <unk> in the <unk> of friendship — but , upon my soul , you may rely upon me in every respect save and except the tender passion only ! ” The struggle in Mr. Guppy ’ s breast and the numerous <unk> it <unk> him between his mother ’ s door and us were sufficiently <unk> in the <unk> street ( particularly as his hair wanted cutting ) to make us hurry away .
I did so with a <unk> heart ; but when we last looked back , Mr. Guppy was still <unk> in the same troubled state of mind .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> and <unk> The name of Mr. Vholes , preceded by the <unk> <unk> , is <unk> upon a <unk> in Symond ’ s Inn , Chancery Lane — a little , pale , <unk> , <unk> inn like a large <unk> of two <unk> and a <unk> .
It looks as if Symond were a sparing man in his way and <unk> his inn of old building <unk> which took kindly to the dry <unk> and to dirt and all things decaying and dismal , and <unk> Symond ’ s memory with congenial <unk> .
<unk> in this dingy <unk> <unk> of Symond are the legal <unk> of Mr. Vholes .
Mr. Vholes ’ s office , in disposition retiring and in situation retired , is squeezed up in a corner and <unk> at a dead wall .
Three feet of <unk> dark passage bring the client to Mr. Vholes ’ s <unk> door , in an <unk> profoundly dark on the brightest <unk> morning and <unk> by a black <unk> of <unk> staircase against which <unk> <unk> generally strike their <unk> .
Mr. Vholes ’ s chambers are on so small a scale that one clerk can open the door without getting off his stool , while the other who elbows him at the same desk has equal <unk> for <unk> the fire .
A smell as of unwholesome sheep <unk> with the smell of must and dust is <unk> to the <unk> ( and often daily ) <unk> of mutton fat in candles and to the <unk> of parchment forms and <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The atmosphere is otherwise <unk> and close .
The place was last painted or whitewashed beyond the memory of man , and the two chimneys smoke , and there is a loose outer surface of soot everywhere , and the dull cracked windows in their heavy <unk> have but one piece of character in them , which is a determination to be always dirty and always shut unless <unk> .
This accounts for the phenomenon of the <unk> of the two usually having a bundle of <unk> <unk> between its <unk> in hot weather .
Mr. Vholes is a very respectable man .
He has not a large business , but he is a very respectable man .
He is allowed by the greater <unk> who have made good fortunes or are making them to be a most respectable man .
He never <unk> a chance in his practice , which is a mark of respectability .
He never takes any pleasure , which is another mark of respectability .
He is reserved and serious , which is another mark of respectability .
His digestion is <unk> , which is highly respectable .
And he is making <unk> of the grass which is flesh , for his three daughters .
And his father is dependent on him in the Vale of Taunton .
The one great principle of the English law is to make business for itself .
There is no other principle distinctly , certainly , and <unk> maintained through all its narrow <unk> .
<unk> by this light it becomes a <unk> scheme and not the monstrous <unk> the <unk> are apt to think it .
Let them but once clearly perceive that its grand principle is to make business for itself at their expense , and surely they will <unk> to <unk> .
But not <unk> this quite plainly — only seeing it by <unk> in a confused way — the <unk> sometimes suffer in peace and pocket , with a bad grace , and DO <unk> very much .
Then this respectability of Mr. Vholes is brought into powerful play against them .
“ <unk> this <unk> , my good sir ? ” says Mr. Kenge to a <unk> client .
“ <unk> it , my dear sir ?
Never , with my consent .
<unk> this law , sir , and what will be the effect of your rash proceeding on a class of practitioners very <unk> represented , allow me to say to you , by the opposite <unk> in the case , Mr. Vholes ?
Sir , that class of practitioners would be <unk> from the face of the earth .
Now you cannot afford — I will say , the social system cannot afford — to lose an order of men like Mr. Vholes .
<unk> , <unk> , steady , <unk> in business .
My dear sir , I understand your present feelings against the <unk> state of things , which I <unk> to be a little hard in your case ; but I can never raise my voice for the <unk> of a class of men like Mr. Vholes . ” The respectability of Mr. Vholes has even been <unk> with crushing effect before <unk> committees , as in the following blue minutes of a distinguished <unk> ’ s evidence .
“ Question ( number five hundred and <unk> thousand eight hundred and <unk> ) : If I understand you , these forms of practice <unk> occasion delay ?
Answer : Yes , some delay .
Question : And great expense ?
Answer : Most assuredly they cannot be gone through for nothing .
Question : And unspeakable vexation ?
Answer : I am not prepared to say that .
They have never given ME any vexation ; quite the contrary .
Question : But you think that their <unk> would <unk> a class of practitioners ?
Answer : I have no doubt of it .
Question : Can you instance any <unk> of that class ?
Answer : Yes .
I would <unk> mention Mr. Vholes .
He would be ruined .
Question : Mr. Vholes is considered , in the profession , a respectable man ?
Answer : ” — which proved fatal to the inquiry for ten years — “ Mr.
Vholes is considered , in the profession , a <unk> respectable man . ” So in familiar conversation , private authorities no less disinterested will remark that they don ’ t know what this age is coming to , that we are plunging down <unk> , that now here is something else gone , that these changes are death to people like Vholes — a man of <unk> respectability , with a father in the Vale of Taunton , and three daughters at home .
Take a few steps more in this direction , say they , and what is to become of Vholes ’ s father ?
Is he to <unk> ?
And of Vholes ’ s daughters ?
Are they to be <unk> , or <unk> ?
As though , Mr. Vholes and his relations being minor <unk> <unk> and it being proposed to <unk> <unk> , indignant <unk> were to put the case thus : Make <unk> <unk> , and you <unk> the <unk> !
In a word , Mr. Vholes , with his three daughters and his father in the Vale of Taunton , is continually doing duty , like a piece of timber , to shore up some <unk> <unk> that has become a <unk> and a <unk> .
And with a great many people in a great many <unk> , the question is never one of a change from wrong to right ( which is quite an <unk> consideration ) , but is always one of injury or advantage to that eminently respectable <unk> , Vholes .
The Chancellor is , within these ten minutes , “ up ” for the long vacation .
Mr. Vholes , and his young client , and several blue bags hastily stuffed out of all <unk> of form , as the larger sort of <unk> are in their first <unk> state , have returned to the official <unk> .
Mr. Vholes , quiet and unmoved , as a man of so much respectability ought to be , takes off his close black gloves as if he were <unk> his hands , lifts off his tight hat as if he were <unk> himself , and sits down at his desk .
The client throws his hat and gloves upon the ground — <unk> them anywhere , without looking after them or <unk> where they go ; <unk> himself into a chair , half <unk> and half <unk> ; rests his <unk> head upon his hand and looks the portrait of young despair .
“ Again nothing done ! ” says Richard .
“ Nothing , nothing done ! ” “ Don ’ t say nothing done , sir , ” returns the placid Vholes .
“ That is scarcely fair , sir , scarcely fair ! ” “ Why , what IS done ? ” says Richard , turning gloomily upon him .
“ That may not be the whole question , ” returns Vholes , “ The question may <unk> off into what is doing , what is doing ? ” “ And what is doing ? ” asks the <unk> client .
Vholes , sitting with his arms on the desk , quietly bringing the <unk> of his five right fingers to meet the <unk> of his five left fingers , and quietly <unk> them again , and fixedly and slowly looking at his client , replies , “ A good deal is doing , sir .
We have put our shoulders to the wheel , Mr. Carstone , and the wheel is going round . ” “ Yes , with <unk> on it .
How am I to get through the next four or five <unk> months ? ” exclaims the young man , rising from his chair and walking about the room .
“ Mr.
C. , ” returns Vholes , following him close with his eyes wherever he goes , “ your spirits are hasty , and I am sorry for it on your account .
Excuse me if I recommend you not to <unk> so much , not to be so <unk> , not to wear yourself out so .
You should have more patience .
You should <unk> yourself better . ” “ I ought to <unk> you , in fact , Mr. Vholes ? ” says Richard , sitting down again with an impatient laugh and beating the devil ’ s <unk> with his <unk> on the <unk> carpet .
“ Sir , ” returns Vholes , always looking at the client as if he were making a lingering meal of him with his eyes as well as with his professional appetite .
“ Sir , ” returns Vholes with his inward manner of speech and his <unk> <unk> , “ I should not have had the <unk> to propose myself as a model for your imitation or any man ’ s .
Let me but leave the good name to my three daughters , and that is enough for me ; I am not a <unk> .
But since you mention me so <unk> , I will acknowledge that I should like to <unk> to you a little of my — come , sir , you are disposed to call it insensibility , and I am sure I have no objection — say insensibility — a little of my insensibility . ” “ Mr.
Vholes , ” explains the client , somewhat abashed , “ I had no intention to <unk> you of insensibility . ” “ I think you had , sir , without knowing it , ” returns the <unk> Vholes .
“ Very naturally .
It is my duty to attend to your interests with a cool head , and I can quite understand that to your excited feelings I may appear , at such times as the present , insensible .
My daughters may know me better ; my aged father may know me better .
But they have known me much longer than you have , and the confiding eye of affection is not the distrustful eye of business .
Not that I complain , sir , of the eye of business being distrustful ; quite the contrary .
In attending to your interests , I wish to have all possible checks upon me ; it is right that I should have them ; I court inquiry .
But your interests <unk> that I should be cool and <unk> , Mr. Carstone ; and I cannot be otherwise — no , sir , not even to please you . ” Mr. Vholes , after glancing at the official cat who is patiently watching a mouse ’ s <unk> , <unk> his charmed gaze again on his young client and proceeds in his <unk> , <unk> voice as if there were an <unk> spirit in him that will neither come out nor speak out , “ What are you to do , sir , you inquire , during the vacation .
I should hope you gentlemen of the army may find many means of <unk> yourselves if you give your minds to it .
If you had asked me what I was to do during the vacation , I could have answered you more readily .
I am to attend to your interests .
I am to be found here , day by day , attending to your interests .
That is my duty , Mr. C. , and <unk> or vacation makes no difference to me .
If you wish to consult me as to your interests , you will find me here at all times alike .
Other professional men go out of town .
I don ’ t .
Not that I blame them for going ; I merely say I don ’ t go .
This desk is your rock , sir ! ” Mr. Vholes gives it a <unk> , and it sounds as hollow as a <unk> .
Not to Richard , though .
There is encouragement in the sound to him .
Perhaps Mr. Vholes knows there is .
“ I am perfectly aware , Mr. Vholes , ” says Richard , more <unk> and good-humouredly , “ that you are the most <unk> fellow in the world and that to have to do with you is to have to do with a man of business who is not to be <unk> .
But put yourself in my case , dragging on this <unk> life , sinking deeper and deeper into difficulty every day , continually hoping and continually disappointed , conscious of change upon change for the worse in myself , and of no change for the better in anything else , and you will find it a <unk> case sometimes , as I do . ” “ You know , ” says Mr. Vholes , “ that I never give hopes , sir .
I told you from the first , Mr. C. , that I never give hopes .
<unk> in a case like this , where the greater part of the costs comes out of the estate , I should not be considerate of my good name if I gave hopes .
It might seem as if costs were my object .
Still , when you say there is no change for the better , I must , as a bare matter of fact , deny that . ” “ Aye ? ” returns Richard , <unk> .
“ But how do you make it out ? ” “ Mr.
Carstone , you are represented by — ” “ You said just now — a rock . ” “ Yes , sir , ” says Mr. Vholes , gently shaking his head and <unk> the hollow desk , with a sound as if ashes were falling on ashes , and dust on dust , “ a rock .
That ’ s something .
You are <unk> represented , and no longer hidden and lost in the interests of others .
THAT ’ S something .
The suit does not sleep ; we wake it up , we air it , we walk it about .
THAT ’ S something .
It ’ s not all Jarndyce , in fact as well as in name .
THAT ’ S something .
Nobody has it all his own way now , sir .
And THAT ’ S something , surely . ” Richard , his face <unk> suddenly , strikes the desk with his <unk> hand .
“ Mr.
Vholes !
If any man had told me when I first went to John Jarndyce ’ s house that he was anything but the disinterested friend he seemed — that he was what he has gradually turned out to be — I could have found no words strong enough to <unk> the <unk> ; I could not have <unk> him too <unk> .
So little did I know of the world !
Whereas now I do declare to you that he becomes to me the <unk> of the suit ; that in place of its being an <unk> , it is John Jarndyce ; that the more I suffer , the more indignant I am with him ; that every new delay and every new disappointment is only a new injury from John Jarndyce ’ s hand . ” “ No , no , ” says Vholes .
“ Don ’ t say so .
We ought to have patience , all of us .
Besides , I never disparage , sir .
I never disparage . ” “ Mr.
Vholes , ” returns the angry client .
“ You know as well as I that he would have <unk> the suit if he could . ” “ He was not active in it , ” Mr. Vholes admits with an appearance of <unk> .
“ He certainly was not active in it .
But however , but however , he might have had amiable intentions .
Who can read the heart , Mr. C. ! ” “ You can , ” returns Richard .
“ I , Mr. C. ? ” “ Well enough to know what his intentions were .
Are or are not our interests <unk> ?
Tell — me — that ! ” says Richard , <unk> his last three words with three raps on his rock of trust .
“ Mr.
C. , ” returns Vholes , immovable in attitude and never winking his hungry eyes , “ I should be wanting in my duty as your professional adviser , I should be <unk> from my fidelity to your interests , if I represented those interests as <unk> with the interests of Mr. Jarndyce .
They are no such thing , sir .
I never <unk> motives ; I both have and am a father , and I never <unk> motives .
But I must not <unk> from a professional duty , even if it <unk> <unk> in families .
I understand you to be now consulting me professionally as to your interests ?
You are so ?
I reply , then , they are not <unk> with those of Mr. Jarndyce . ” “ Of course they are not ! ” cries Richard .
“ You found that out long ago . ” “ Mr.
C. , ” returns Vholes , “ I wish to say no more of any third party than is necessary .
I wish to leave my good name <unk> , together with any little property of which I may become possessed through <unk> and perseverance , to my daughters Emma , Jane , and Caroline .
I also desire to live in <unk> with my professional <unk> .
When Mr. Skimpole did me the honour , sir — I will not say the very high honour , for I never <unk> to <unk> — of bringing us together in this room , I mentioned to you that I could offer no opinion or advice as to your interests while those interests were <unk> to another member of the profession .
And I spoke in such terms as I was bound to speak of Kenge and Carboy ’ s office , which stands high .
You , sir , thought fit to withdraw your interests from that keeping <unk> and to offer them to me .
You brought them with clean hands , sir , and I accepted them with clean hands .
Those interests are now <unk> in this office .
My <unk> <unk> , as you may have heard me mention , are not in a good state , and rest might improve them ; but I shall not rest , sir , while I am your representative .
Whenever you want me , you will find me here .
<unk> me anywhere , and I will come .
During the long vacation , sir , I shall devote my leisure to <unk> your interests more and more closely and to making arrangements for moving heaven and earth ( including , of course , the Chancellor ) after <unk> term ; and when I <unk> <unk> you , sir , ” says Mr. Vholes with the severity of a determined man , “ when I <unk> <unk> you , sir , with all my heart , on your <unk> to fortune — which , but that I never give hopes , I might say something further about — you will owe me nothing beyond whatever little balance may be then <unk> of the costs as between solicitor and client not included in the <unk> costs allowed out of the estate .
I pretend to no claim upon you , Mr. C. , but for the zealous and active discharge — not the languid and <unk> discharge , sir : that much credit I <unk> for — of my professional duty .
My duty <unk> ended , all between us is ended . ” Vholes finally adds , by way of <unk> to this declaration of his principles , that as Mr. Carstone is about to <unk> his <unk> , perhaps Mr. C. will favour him with an order on his agent for twenty pounds on account .
“ For there have been many little <unk> and <unk> of late , sir , ” observes Vholes , turning over the leaves of his <unk> , “ and these things mount up , and I don ’ t <unk> to be a man of capital .
When we first entered on our present relations I stated to you openly — it is a principle of mine that there never can be too much <unk> between solicitor and client — that I was not a man of capital and that if capital was your object you had better leave your papers in Kenge ’ s office .
No , Mr. C. , you will find none of the advantages or <unk> of capital here , sir .
This , ” Vholes gives the desk one hollow blow again , “ is your rock ; it <unk> to be nothing more . ” The client , with his <unk> <unk> relieved and his vague hopes <unk> , takes pen and ink and writes the <unk> , not without perplexed consideration and calculation of the date it may bear , <unk> <unk> effects in the agent ’ s hands .
All the while , Vholes , buttoned up in body and mind , looks at him attentively .
All the while , Vholes ’ s official cat watches the mouse ’ s <unk> .
<unk> , the client , shaking hands , <unk> Mr. Vholes , for heaven ’ s sake and earth ’ s sake , to do his utmost to “ pull him through ” the Court of Chancery .
Mr. Vholes , who never gives hopes , lays his palm upon the client ’ s shoulder and answers with a smile , “ Always here , sir .
<unk> , or by letter , you will always find me here , sir , with my shoulder to the wheel . ” Thus they part , and Vholes , left alone , <unk> himself in carrying <unk> little matters out of his <unk> into his <unk> bill book for the <unk> <unk> of his three daughters .
So might an industrious <unk> or bear make up his account of <unk> or stray <unk> with an eye to his <unk> , not to disparage by that word the three <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> who <unk> with the parent Vholes in an <unk> cottage situated in a damp garden at <unk> .
Richard , <unk> from the heavy shade of Symond ’ s Inn into the sunshine of Chancery Lane — for there happens to be sunshine there to-day — walks thoughtfully on , and turns into Lincoln ’ s Inn , and passes under the shadow of the Lincoln ’ s Inn trees .
On many such <unk> have the <unk> shadows of those trees often fallen ; on the like bent head , the <unk> <unk> , the lowering eye , the lingering step , the <unk> and <unk> air , the good <unk> and consumed , the life turned <unk> .
This <unk> is not shabby yet , but that may come .
Chancery , which knows no wisdom but in <unk> , is very rich in such precedents ; and why should one be different from ten thousand ?
Yet the time is so short since his <unk> began that as he <unk> away , <unk> to leave the spot for some long months together , though he <unk> it , Richard himself may feel his own case as if it were a <unk> one .
While his heart is heavy with <unk> care , suspense , distrust , and doubt , it may have room for some sorrowful wonder when he recalls how different his first visit there , how different he , how different all the colours of his mind .
But injustice <unk> injustice ; the <unk> with shadows and being <unk> by them <unk> the setting up of <unk> to <unk> ; from the <unk> suit which no man alive can understand , the time for that being long gone by , it has become a gloomy relief to turn to the <unk> figure of the friend who would have saved him from this ruin and make HIM his enemy .
Richard has told Vholes the truth .
Is he in a <unk> or a softened <unk> , he still lays his <unk> equally at that door ; he was <unk> , in that quarter , of a set purpose , and that purpose could only <unk> in the one subject that is <unk> his existence into itself ; besides , it is a <unk> to him in his own eyes to have an <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
Is Richard a monster in all this , or would Chancery be found rich in such precedents too if they could be got for <unk> from the <unk> <unk> ?
Two <unk> of eyes not <unk> to such people look after him , as , biting his <unk> and <unk> , he crosses the square and is swallowed up by the shadow of the <unk> gateway .
Mr. Guppy and Mr. Weevle are the <unk> of those eyes , and they have been leaning in conversation against the low stone parapet under the trees .
He passes close by them , seeing nothing but the ground .
“ William , ” says Mr. Weevle , adjusting his whiskers , “ there ’ s combustion going on there !
It ’ s not a case of spontaneous , but it ’ s <unk> combustion it is . ” “ Ah ! ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ He wouldn ’ t keep out of Jarndyce , and I suppose he ’ s over head and ears in debt .
I never knew much of him .
He was as high as the monument when he was on trial at our place .
A good <unk> to me , whether as clerk or client !
Well , Tony , that as I was mentioning is what they ’ re up to . ” Mr. Guppy , <unk> his arms , <unk> himself against the parapet , as resuming a conversation of interest .
“ They are still up to it , sir , ” says Mr. Guppy , “ still taking stock , still examining papers , still going over the heaps and heaps of rubbish .
At this rate they ’ ll be at it these seven years . ” “ And Small is helping ? ” “ Small left us at a week ’ s notice .
<unk> Kenge his grandfather ’ s business was too much for the old gentleman and he could better himself by undertaking it .
There had been a coolness between myself and Small on account of his being so close .
But he said you and I began it , and as he had me there — for we did — I put our acquaintance on the old footing .
That ’ s how I come to know what they ’ re up to . ” “ You haven ’ t looked in at all ? ” “ Tony , ” says Mr. Guppy , a little disconcerted , “ to be <unk> with you , I don ’ t greatly <unk> the house , except in your company , and therefore I have not ; and therefore I proposed this little appointment for our <unk> away your things .
There goes the hour by the clock !
Tony ” — Mr.
Guppy becomes mysteriously and tenderly eloquent — “ it is necessary that I should <unk> upon your mind once more that circumstances over which I have no control have made a melancholy <unk> in my most <unk> plans and in that <unk> image which I formerly mentioned to you as a friend .
That image is shattered , and that <unk> is laid low .
My only wish now in connexion with the objects which I had an idea of carrying out in the court with your aid as a friend is to let ’ em alone and <unk> ’ em in oblivion .
Do you think it possible , do you think it at all likely ( I put it to you , Tony , as a friend ) , from your knowledge of that <unk> and deep old character who fell a prey to the — spontaneous <unk> , do you , Tony , think it at all likely that on second thoughts he put those letters away anywhere , after you saw him alive , and that they were not destroyed that night ? ” Mr. Weevle <unk> for some time .
<unk> his head .
<unk> thinks not .
“ Tony , ” says Mr. Guppy as they walk towards the court , “ once again understand me , as a friend .
Without entering into further <unk> , I may repeat that the <unk> is down .
I have no purpose to serve now but <unk> in oblivion .
To that I have <unk> myself .
I owe it to myself , and I owe it to the shattered image , as also to the circumstances over which I have no control .
If you was to express to me by a gesture , by a wink , that you saw lying anywhere in your late lodgings any papers that so much as looked like the papers in question , I would pitch them into the fire , sir , on my own responsibility . ” Mr. Weevle nods .
Mr. Guppy , much elevated in his own opinion by having delivered these observations , with an air in part forensic and in part romantic — this gentleman having a passion for conducting anything in the form of an examination , or delivering anything in the form of a <unk> up or a speech — accompanies his friend with dignity to the court .
Never since it has been a court has it had such a <unk> ’ purse of <unk> as in the proceedings at the rag and bottle shop .
<unk> , every morning at eight , is the elder Mr. Smallweed brought down to the corner and carried in , accompanied by Mrs. Smallweed , Judy , and Bart ; and regularly , all day , do they all remain there until nine at night , <unk> by <unk> <unk> , not <unk> in quantity , from the cook ’ s shop , <unk> and searching , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> among the <unk> of the late <unk> .
What those <unk> are they keep so secret that the court is <unk> .
In its <unk> it <unk> guineas <unk> out of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , old chairs and <unk> stuffed with <unk> of England notes .
It <unk> itself of the <unk> history ( with highly coloured folding <unk> ) of Mr. <unk> <unk> and his sister , and also of Mr. <unk> , of <unk> , and <unk> all the facts from those <unk> <unk> to Mr. Krook .
<unk> when the <unk> is called in to carry off a <unk> of old paper , ashes , and broken bottles , the whole court <unk> and <unk> into the <unk> as they come forth .
Many times the two gentlemen who write with the <unk> little pens on the <unk> are seen <unk> in the neighbourhood — shy of each other , their late <unk> being <unk> .
The Sol <unk> carries a <unk> of the <unk> interest through the Harmonic nights .
Little Swills , in what are professionally known as “ <unk> ” <unk> to the subject , is received with loud <unk> ; and the same vocalist “ <unk> ” in the regular business like a man inspired .
Even Miss M. <unk> , in the revived <unk> <unk> of “ We ’ re <unk> , ” points the sentiment that “ the dogs love <unk> ” ( whatever the nature of that refreshment may be ) with such <unk> and such a turn of the head towards next door that she is immediately understood to mean Mr. Smallweed loves to find money , and is <unk> honoured with a double <unk> .
For all this , the court <unk> nothing ; and as Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins now communicate to the late lodger whose appearance is the signal for a general rally , it is in one <unk> <unk> to <unk> everything , and more .
Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy , with every eye in the court ’ s head upon them , knock at the closed door of the late <unk> ’ s house , in a high state of <unk> .
But being contrary to the court ’ s expectation admitted , they immediately become <unk> and are considered to mean no good .
The shutters are more or less closed all over the house , and the <unk> is sufficiently dark to require candles .
<unk> into the back shop by Mr. Smallweed the younger , they , fresh from the sunlight , can at first see nothing save darkness and shadows ; but they gradually <unk> the elder Mr. Smallweed seated in his chair upon the <unk> of a well or grave of waste-paper , the <unk> Judy groping <unk> like a female <unk> , and Mrs. Smallweed on the level ground in the <unk> <unk> up in a heap of paper fragments , print , and manuscript which would appear to be the <unk> compliments that have been sent flying at her in the course of the day .
The whole party , Small included , are blackened with dust and dirt and present a <unk> appearance not relieved by the general aspect of the room .
There is more litter and <unk> in it than of old , and it is <unk> if possible ; likewise , it is ghostly with traces of its dead <unk> and even with his <unk> writing on the wall .
On the entrance of visitors , Mr. Smallweed and Judy <unk> <unk> their arms and stop in their <unk> .
“ <unk> ! ” <unk> the old gentleman .
“ How de do , gentlemen , how de do !
Come to fetch your property , Mr. Weevle ?
That ’ s well , that ’ s well .
Ha !
Ha !
We should have been forced to sell you up , sir , to pay your <unk> room if you had left it here much longer .
You feel quite at home here again , I dare say ?
Glad to see you , glad to see you ! ” Mr. Weevle , thanking him , casts an eye about .
Mr. Guppy ’ s eye follows Mr. Weevle ’ s eye .
Mr. Weevle ’ s eye comes back without any new intelligence in it .
Mr. Guppy ’ s eye comes back and meets Mr. Smallweed ’ s eye .
That engaging old gentleman is still <unk> , like some <unk> instrument running down , “ How de do , sir — how de — how — ” And then having run down , he <unk> into <unk> silence , as Mr. Guppy starts at seeing Mr. Tulkinghorn standing in the darkness opposite with his hands behind him .
“ <unk> so kind as to act as my solicitor , ” says Grandfather Smallweed .
“ I am not the sort of client for a gentleman of such note , but he is so good ! ” Mr. Guppy , slightly <unk> his friend to take another look , makes a shuffling bow to Mr. Tulkinghorn , who returns it with an easy nod .
Mr. Tulkinghorn is looking on as if he had nothing else to do and were rather amused by the novelty .
“ A good deal of property here , sir , I should say , ” Mr. Guppy observes to Mr. Smallweed .
“ <unk> rags and rubbish , my dear friend !
<unk> and rubbish !
Me and Bart and my granddaughter Judy are endeavouring to make out an <unk> of what ’ s worth anything to sell .
But we haven ’ t come to much as yet ; we — haven ’ t — come — to — <unk> ! ” Mr. Smallweed has run down again , while Mr. Weevle ’ s eye , attended by Mr. Guppy ’ s eye , has again gone round the room and come back .
“ Well , sir , ” says Mr. Weevle .
“ We won ’ t <unk> any longer if you ’ ll allow us to go upstairs . ” “ <unk> , my dear sir , anywhere !
You ’ re at home .
Make yourself so , pray ! ” As they go upstairs , Mr. Guppy lifts his eyebrows inquiringly and looks at Tony .
Tony shakes his head .
They find the old room very dull and dismal , with the ashes of the fire that was burning on that memorable night yet in the discoloured grate .
They have a great <unk> to touch any object , and carefully blow the dust from it first .
Nor are they desirous to <unk> their visit , <unk> the few <unk> with all possible speed and never speaking above a whisper .
“ Look here , ” says Tony , <unk> .
“ Here ’ s that horrible cat coming in ! ” Mr. Guppy <unk> behind a chair .
“ Small told me of her .
She went <unk> and <unk> and tearing about that night like a dragon , and got out on the <unk> , and <unk> about up there for a fortnight , and then came tumbling down the chimney very thin .
Did you ever see such a <unk> ?
<unk> as if she knew all about it , don ’ t she ?
<unk> looks as if she was Krook .
<unk> !
Get out , you <unk> ! ” Lady Jane , in the doorway , with her <unk> <unk> from ear to ear and her <unk> of a <unk> , shows no intention of <unk> ; but Mr. Tulkinghorn <unk> over her , she spits at his rusty legs , and <unk> <unk> , takes her arched back upstairs .
<unk> to <unk> the <unk> again and return by the chimney .
“ Mr.
Guppy , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “ could I have a word with you ? ” Mr. Guppy is engaged in <unk> the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty from the wall and <unk> those works of art in their old <unk> <unk> .
“ Sir , ” he returns , reddening , “ I wish to act with <unk> towards every member of the profession , and especially , I am sure , towards a member of it so well known as yourself — I will truly add , sir , so distinguished as yourself .
Still , Mr. Tulkinghorn , sir , I must <unk> that if you have any word with me , that word is spoken in the presence of my friend . ” “ Oh , indeed ? ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ Yes , sir .
My reasons are not of a personal nature at all , but they are <unk> sufficient for myself . ” “ No doubt , no doubt . ” Mr. Tulkinghorn is as imperturbable as the <unk> to which he has quietly walked .
“ The matter is not of that consequence that I need put you to the trouble of making any conditions , Mr. Guppy . ” He pauses here to smile , and his smile is as dull and rusty as his <unk> .
“ You are to be <unk> , Mr. Guppy ; you are a fortunate young man , sir . ” “ Pretty well so , Mr. Tulkinghorn ; I don ’ t complain . ” “ <unk> ?
High friends , free admission to great houses , and access to elegant ladies !
Why , Mr. Guppy , there are people in London who would give their ears to be you . ” Mr. Guppy , looking as if he would give his own reddening and still reddening ears to be one of those people at present instead of himself , replies , “ Sir , if I attend to my profession and do what is right by Kenge and Carboy , my friends and <unk> are of no consequence to them nor to any member of the profession , not excepting Mr. Tulkinghorn of the Fields .
I am not under any obligation to explain myself further ; and with all respect for you , sir , and without offence — I repeat , without offence — ” “ Oh , certainly ! ” “ — I don ’ t intend to do it . ” “ Quite so , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn with a calm nod .
“ Very good ; I see by these portraits that you take a strong interest in the fashionable great , sir ? ” He addresses this to the <unk> Tony , who admits the soft <unk> .
“ A virtue in which few <unk> are deficient , ” observes Mr. Tulkinghorn .
He has been standing on the <unk> with his back to the smoked chimney-piece , and now turns round with his glasses to his eyes .
“ Who is this ?
‘ Lady Dedlock . ’ Ha !
A very good likeness in its way , but it wants force of character .
Good day to you , gentlemen ; good day ! ” When he has walked out , Mr. Guppy , in a great <unk> , <unk> himself to the hasty <unk> of the taking down of the Galaxy Gallery , <unk> with Lady Dedlock .
“ Tony , ” he says hurriedly to his astonished companion , “ let us be quick in putting the things together and in getting out of this place .
It were in vain longer to conceal from you , Tony , that between myself and one of the members of a <unk> <unk> whom I now hold in my hand , there has been <unk> communication and association .
The time might have been when I might have revealed it to you .
It never will be more .
It is due alike to the oath I have taken , alike to the shattered <unk> , and alike to circumstances over which I have no control , that the whole should be buried in oblivion .
I charge you as a friend , by the interest you have ever <unk> in the fashionable intelligence , and by any little advances with which I may have been able to accommodate you , so to <unk> it without a word of inquiry ! ” This charge Mr. Guppy delivers in a state little short of forensic lunacy , while his friend shows a <unk> mind in his whole head of hair and even in his <unk> whiskers .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> and <unk> England has been in a dreadful state for some weeks .
Lord Coodle would go out , Sir Thomas Doodle wouldn ’ t come in , and there being nobody in Great <unk> ( to speak of ) except Coodle and Doodle , there has been no government .
It is a <unk> that the <unk> meeting between those two great men , which at one time seemed <unk> , did not come off , because if both <unk> had taken effect , and Coodle and Doodle had killed each other , it is to be <unk> that England must have waited to be <unk> until young Coodle and young Doodle , now in <unk> and long stockings , were grown up .
This <unk> national calamity , however , was <unk> by Lord Coodle ’ s making the <unk> discovery that if in the heat of <unk> he had said that he <unk> and <unk> the whole <unk> career of Sir Thomas Doodle , he had merely meant to say that party <unk> should never induce him to <unk> from it the tribute of his <unk> admiration ; while it as <unk> turned out , on the other hand , that Sir Thomas Doodle had in his own bosom expressly <unk> Lord Coodle to go down to <unk> as the <unk> of virtue and honour .
Still England has been some weeks in the dismal <unk> of having no <unk> ( as was well observed by Sir Leicester Dedlock ) to weather the storm ; and the <unk> part of the matter is that England has not appeared to care very much about it , but has gone on eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage as the old world did in the days before the <unk> .
But Coodle knew the danger , and Doodle knew the danger , and all their followers and <unk> had the <unk> possible perception of the danger .
At last Sir Thomas Doodle has not only <unk> to come in , but has done it handsomely , bringing in with him all his <unk> , all his <unk> cousins , and all his <unk> .
So there is hope for the old ship yet .
Doodle has found that he must throw himself upon the country , chiefly in the form of <unk> and beer .
In this <unk> state he is <unk> in a good many places <unk> and can throw himself upon a considerable portion of the country at one time .
<unk> being much occupied in <unk> Doodle in the form of <unk> , and <unk> Doodle in the form of beer , and in <unk> herself black in the face that she does neither — plainly to the <unk> of her glory and <unk> — the London season comes to a sudden end , through all the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to assist <unk> in those <unk> <unk> .
Hence Mrs. Rouncewell , housekeeper at Chesney Wold , <unk> , though no instructions have yet come down , that the family may shortly be expected , together with a pretty large <unk> of cousins and others who can in any way assist the great <unk> work .
And hence the stately old <unk> , taking Time by the <unk> , leads him up and down the staircases , and along the <unk> and passages , and through the rooms , to witness before he <unk> any older that everything is ready , that <unk> are rubbed bright , <unk> spread , curtains shaken out , beds <unk> and patted , <unk> and kitchen cleared for action — all things prepared as <unk> the Dedlock dignity .
This present summer evening , as the sun goes down , the preparations are complete .
<unk> and solemn the old house looks , with so many <unk> of <unk> and with no inhabitants except the <unk> forms upon the walls .
So did these come and go , a Dedlock in possession might have <unk> passing along ; so did they see this gallery hushed and quiet , as I see it now ; so think , as I think , of the <unk> that they would make in this <unk> when they were gone ; so find it , as I find it , difficult to believe that it could be without them ; so pass from my world , as I pass from <unk> , now closing the <unk> door ; so leave no blank to miss them , and so die .
Through some of the fiery windows beautiful from without , and set , at this <unk> hour , not in <unk> stone but in a glorious house of gold , the light <unk> at other windows <unk> in rich , <unk> , <unk> like the summer plenty in the land .
Then do the frozen Dedlocks <unk> .
<unk> movements come upon their features as the shadows of leaves play there .
A dense justice in a corner is <unk> into a wink .
A staring baronet , with a <unk> , gets a <unk> in his chin .
Down into the bosom of a <unk> <unk> there <unk> a <unk> of light and warmth that would have done it good a hundred years ago .
One <unk> of Volumnia , in <unk> shoes , very like her — casting the shadow of that <unk> event before her full two centuries — <unk> out into a <unk> and becomes a saint .
A maid of honour of the court of Charles the Second , with large round eyes ( and other charms to <unk> ) , seems to <unk> in glowing water , and it <unk> as it <unk> .
But the fire of the sun is dying .
Even now the floor is <unk> , and shadow slowly <unk> the walls , bringing the Dedlocks down like age and death .
And now , upon my Lady ’ s picture over the great chimney-piece , a <unk> shade falls from some old tree , that turns it pale , and <unk> it , and looks as if a great arm held a veil or <unk> , watching an opportunity to draw it over her .
<unk> and <unk> rises shadow on the wall — now a red gloom on the ceiling — now the fire is out .
All that prospect , which from the terrace looked so near , has moved solemnly away and changed — not the first nor the last of beautiful things that look so near and will so change — into a distant <unk> .
<unk> <unk> arise , and the <unk> falls , and all the sweet <unk> in the garden are heavy in the air .
Now the woods settle into great <unk> as if they were each one profound tree .
And now the moon rises to separate them , and to <unk> here and there in <unk> lines behind their <unk> , and to make the avenue a pavement of light among high <unk> <unk> <unk> broken .
Now the moon is high ; and the great house , <unk> <unk> more than ever , is like a body without life .
Now it is even awful , <unk> through it , to think of the live people who have slept in the solitary <unk> , to say nothing of the dead .
Now is the time for shadow , when every corner is a <unk> and every downward step a pit , when the stained glass is reflected in pale and faded <unk> upon the <unk> , when anything and everything can be made of the heavy staircase <unk> excepting their own proper shapes , when the <unk> has dull lights upon it not easily to be distinguished from <unk> movement , and when <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> of heads inside .
But of all the shadows in Chesney Wold , the shadow in the long drawing-room upon my Lady ’ s picture is the first to come , the last to be disturbed .
At this hour and by this light it changes into threatening hands raised up and <unk> the handsome face with every breath that stirs .
“ She is not well , ma ’ am , ” says a <unk> in Mrs. Rouncewell ’ s <unk> .
“ My Lady not well !
What ’ s the matter ? ” “ Why , my Lady has been but poorly , ma ’ am , since she was last here — I don ’ t mean with the family , ma ’ am , but when she was here as a bird of passage like .
My Lady has not been out much , for her , and has kept her room a good deal . ” “ Chesney Wold , Thomas , ” rejoins the housekeeper with proud <unk> , “ will set my Lady up !
There is no finer air and no <unk> <unk> in the world ! ” Thomas may have his own personal opinions on this subject , probably <unk> them in his manner of smoothing his <unk> head from the <unk> of his neck to his temples , but he <unk> to express them further and retires to the servants ’ hall to <unk> on cold <unk> and <unk> .
This <unk> is the <unk> before the <unk> <unk> .
Next evening , down come Sir Leicester and my Lady with their <unk> <unk> , and down come the cousins and others from all the points of the <unk> .
<unk> for some weeks backward and forward rush mysterious men with no names , who fly about all those particular parts of the country on which Doodle is at present throwing himself in an <unk> and <unk> shower , but who are merely persons of a restless disposition and never do anything anywhere .
On these national occasions Sir Leicester finds the cousins useful .
A better man than the Honourable Bob Stables to meet the <unk> at dinner , there could not possibly be .
Better got up gentlemen than the other cousins to ride over to <unk> and <unk> here and there , and show themselves on the side of England , it would be hard to find .
Volumnia is a little dim , but she is of the true <unk> ; and there are many who <unk> her sprightly conversation , her French <unk> so old as to have become in the <unk> of time almost new again , the honour of taking the fair Dedlock in to dinner , or even the privilege of her hand in the dance .
On these national occasions dancing may be a <unk> service , and Volumnia is constantly seen hopping about for the good of an ungrateful and <unk> country .
My Lady takes no great pains to entertain the numerous guests , and being still <unk> , rarely appears until late in the day .
But at all the dismal <unk> , leaden <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and other melancholy <unk> , her mere appearance is a relief .
As to Sir Leicester , he <unk> it utterly impossible that anything can be wanting , in any direction , by any one who has the good fortune to be received under that roof ; and in a state of <unk> satisfaction , he moves among the company , a magnificent <unk> .
<unk> the cousins <unk> through dust and canter over <unk> turf , away to <unk> and <unk> ( with <unk> gloves and <unk> for the <unk> and <unk> gloves and <unk> for the <unk> ) , and daily bring back reports on which Sir Leicester holds forth after dinner .
<unk> the restless men who have no occupation in life present the appearance of being rather busy .
<unk> Volumnia has a little cousinly talk with Sir Leicester on the state of the <unk> , from which Sir Leicester is disposed to conclude that Volumnia is a more <unk> woman than he had thought her .
“ How are we getting on ? ” says Miss Volumnia , <unk> her hands .
“ ARE we safe ? ” The mighty business is nearly over by this time , and Doodle will throw himself off the country in a few days more .
Sir Leicester has just appeared in the long drawing-room after dinner , a bright particular star surrounded by clouds of cousins .
“ Volumnia , ” replies Sir Leicester , who has a list in his hand , “ we are doing tolerably . ” “ Only tolerably ! ” Although it is summer weather , Sir Leicester always has his own particular fire in the evening .
He takes his usual <unk> seat near it and repeats with much <unk> and a little displeasure , as who should say , I am not a common man , and when I say tolerably , it must not be understood as a common expression , “ Volumnia , we are doing tolerably . ” “ At least there is no opposition to YOU , ” Volumnia <unk> with confidence .
“ No , Volumnia .
This <unk> country has lost its senses in many respects , I <unk> to say , but — ” “ It is not so mad as that .
I am glad to hear it ! ” Volumnia ’ s finishing the sentence <unk> her to favour .
Sir Leicester , with a gracious inclination of his head , seems to say to himself , “ A sensible woman this , on the whole , though occasionally <unk> . ” In fact , as to this question of opposition , the fair Dedlock ’ s observation was superfluous , Sir Leicester on these occasions always delivering in his own <unk> , as a kind of handsome <unk> order to be promptly executed .
Two other little seats that belong to him he <unk> as <unk> orders of less importance , merely sending down the men and <unk> to the <unk> , “ You will have the goodness to make these <unk> into two members of Parliament and to send them home when done . ” “ I regret to say , Volumnia , that in many places the people have shown a bad spirit , and that this opposition to the government has been of a most determined and most <unk> description . ” “ <unk> ! ” says Volumnia .
“ Even , ” proceeds Sir Leicester , glancing at the <unk> cousins on <unk> and <unk> , “ even in many — in fact , in most — of those places in which the government has carried it against a <unk> — ” ( <unk> , by the way , that the <unk> are always a <unk> with the <unk> , and that the <unk> occupy exactly the same position towards the <unk> . )
“ — Even in them I am shocked , for the credit of <unk> , to be constrained to inform you that the party has not <unk> without being put to an <unk> expense .
<unk> , ” says Sir Leicester , eyeing the cousins with increasing dignity and <unk> indignation , “ hundreds of thousands of pounds ! ” If Volumnia have a fault , it is the fault of being a trifle too innocent , seeing that the innocence which would go extremely well with a <unk> and <unk> is a little out of keeping with the rouge and pearl necklace .
<unk> , <unk> by innocence , she asks , “ What for ? ” “ Volumnia , ” remonstrates Sir Leicester with his utmost severity .
“ Volumnia ! ” “ No , no , I don ’ t mean what for , ” cries Volumnia with her favourite little scream .
“ How <unk> I am !
I mean what a pity ! ” “ I am glad , ” returns Sir Leicester , “ that you do mean what a pity . ” Volumnia <unk> to express her opinion that the shocking people ought to be tried as <unk> and made to support the party .
“ I am glad , Volumnia , ” repeats Sir Leicester , <unk> of these <unk> sentiments , “ that you do mean what a pity .
It is disgraceful to the <unk> .
But as you , though <unk> and without <unk> so unreasonable a question , asked me ‘ what for ? ’ let me reply to you .
For necessary expenses .
And I trust to your good sense , Volumnia , not to pursue the subject , here or elsewhere . ” Sir Leicester feels it <unk> on him to observe a crushing aspect towards Volumnia because it is whispered abroad that these necessary expenses will , in some two hundred <unk> <unk> , be <unk> connected with the word <unk> , and because some <unk> <unk> have consequently suggested the <unk> from the <unk> service of the ordinary <unk> in behalf of the High Court of Parliament and have <unk> instead that the prayers of the congregation be requested for six hundred and <unk> gentlemen in a very <unk> state .
“ I suppose , ” observes Volumnia , having taken a little time to recover her spirits after her late <unk> , “ I suppose Mr. Tulkinghorn has been worked to death . ” “ I don ’ t know , ” says Sir Leicester , opening his eyes , “ why Mr. Tulkinghorn should be worked to death .
I don ’ t know what Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s <unk> may be .
He is not a <unk> . ” Volumnia had thought he might have been employed .
Sir Leicester could desire to know by whom , and what for .
Volumnia , abashed again , suggests , by somebody — to advise and make arrangements .
Sir Leicester is not aware that any client of Mr. Tulkinghorn has been in need of his assistance .
Lady Dedlock , seated at an open window with her arm upon its <unk> <unk> and looking out at the evening shadows falling on the park , has seemed to attend since the lawyer ’ s name was mentioned .
A languid cousin with a <unk> in a state of extreme <unk> now observes from his couch that man told him <unk> ’ as ’ <unk> that Tulkinghorn had gone down t ’ that iron place t ’ give legal ’ <unk> ’ <unk> something , and that <unk> being over t ’ day , ’ <unk> be highly <unk> thing if Tulkinghorn should ’ <unk> with news that Coodle man was <unk> .
Mercury in attendance with coffee informs Sir Leicester , <unk> , that Mr. Tulkinghorn has arrived and is taking dinner .
My Lady turns her head inward for the moment , then looks out again as before .
Volumnia is charmed to hear that her delight is come .
He is so original , such a <unk> creature , such an immense being for knowing all sorts of things and never telling them !
Volumnia is persuaded that he must be a <unk> .
Is sure he is at the head of a lodge , and wears short <unk> , and is made a perfect <unk> of with candlesticks and <unk> .
These lively remarks the fair Dedlock delivers in her youthful manner , while making a purse .
“ He has not been here once , ” she adds , “ since I came .
I really had some thoughts of breaking my heart for the <unk> creature .
I had almost made up my mind that he was dead . ” It may be the <unk> gloom of evening , or it may be the <unk> gloom within herself , but a shade is on my Lady ’ s face , as if she thought , “ I would he were ! ” “ Mr.
Tulkinghorn , ” says Sir Leicester , “ is always welcome here and always <unk> <unk> he is .
A very <unk> person , and <unk> respected . ” The debilitated cousin supposes he is “ ’ <unk> rich fler . ” “ He has a stake in the country , ” says Sir Leicester , “ I have no doubt .
He is , of course , handsomely paid , and he <unk> almost on a footing of <unk> with the highest society . ” Everybody starts .
For a gun is <unk> close by .
“ Good gracious , what ’ s that ? ” cries Volumnia with her little withered scream .
“ A <unk> , ” says my Lady .
“ And they have shot him . ” <unk> Mr. Tulkinghorn , followed by Mercuries with lamps and candles .
“ No , no , ” says Sir Leicester , “ I think not .
My Lady , do you object to the twilight ? ” On the contrary , my Lady <unk> it .
“ Volumnia ? ” Oh !
Nothing is so delicious to Volumnia as to sit and talk in the dark .
“ Then take them away , ” says Sir Leicester .
“ Tulkinghorn , I beg your pardon .
How do you do ? ” Mr. Tulkinghorn with his usual leisurely ease advances , <unk> his passing homage to my Lady , shakes Sir Leicester ’ s hand , and <unk> into the chair proper to him when he has anything to communicate , on the opposite side of the Baronet ’ s little <unk> .
Sir Leicester is apprehensive that my Lady , not being very well , will take cold at that open window .
My Lady is obliged to him , but would rather sit there for the air .
Sir Leicester rises , adjusts her <unk> about her , and returns to his seat .
Mr. Tulkinghorn in the meanwhile takes a pinch of snuff .
“ Now , ” says Sir Leicester .
“ How has that <unk> gone ? ” “ Oh , hollow from the beginning .
Not a chance .
They have brought in both their people .
You are beaten out of all reason .
Three to one . ” It is a part of Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s <unk> and <unk> to have no <unk> opinions ; indeed , NO opinions .
Therefore he says “ you ” are beaten , and not “ we . ” Sir Leicester is majestically <unk> .
Volumnia never heard of such a thing .
‘ The debilitated cousin holds that it ’ s sort of thing that ’ s sure <unk> <unk> <unk> — giv ’ n — <unk> .
“ It ’ s the place , you know , ” Mr. Tulkinghorn goes on to say in the <unk> darkness when there is silence again , “ where they wanted to put up Mrs. Rouncewell ’ s son . ” “ A proposal which , as you <unk> informed me at the time , he had the becoming taste and perception , ” observes Sir Leicester , “ to decline .
I cannot say that I by any means approve of the sentiments expressed by Mr. Rouncewell when he was here for some half-hour in this room , but there was a sense of <unk> in his decision which I am glad to acknowledge . ” “ Ha ! ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ It did not prevent him from being very active in this <unk> , though . ” Sir Leicester is distinctly heard to gasp before speaking .
“ Did I understand you ?
Did you say that Mr. Rouncewell had been very active in this <unk> ? ” “ <unk> active . ” “ <unk> — ” “ Oh , dear yes , against you .
He is a very good <unk> .
<unk> and emphatic .
He made a <unk> effect , and has great influence .
In the business part of the proceedings he carried all before him . ” It is evident to the whole company , though nobody can see him , that Sir Leicester is staring majestically .
“ And he was much assisted , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn as a <unk> , “ by his son . ” “ By his son , sir ? ” repeats Sir Leicester with awful politeness .
“ By his son . ” “ The son who wished to marry the young woman in my Lady ’ s service ? ” “ That son .
He has but one . ” “ Then upon my honour , ” says Sir Leicester after a terrific pause during which he has been heard to <unk> and felt to stare , “ then upon my honour , upon my life , upon my reputation and principles , the floodgates of society are burst open , and the waters have — a — <unk> the <unk> of the framework of the <unk> by which things are held together ! ” General burst of cousinly indignation .
Volumnia thinks it is really high time , you know , for somebody in power to step in and do something strong .
<unk> cousin thinks — country ’ s going — <unk> — <unk> pace .
“ I beg , ” says Sir Leicester in a breathless condition , “ that we may not <unk> further on this circumstance .
<unk> is superfluous .
My Lady , let me <unk> in reference to that young woman — ” “ I have no intention , ” observes my Lady from her window in a low but decided tone , “ of parting with her . ” “ That was not my meaning , ” returns Sir Leicester .
“ I am glad to hear you say so .
I would <unk> that as you think her worthy of your patronage , you should <unk> your influence to keep her from these dangerous hands .
You might show her what violence would be done in such association to her duties and principles , and you might preserve her for a better fate .
You might point out to her that she probably would , in good time , find a husband at Chesney Wold by whom she would not be — ” Sir Leicester adds , after a moment ’ s consideration , “ dragged from the <unk> of her <unk> . ” These remarks he offers with his <unk> politeness and deference when he addresses himself to his wife .
She merely moves her head in reply .
The moon is rising , and where she sits there is a little stream of cold pale light , in which her head is seen .
“ It is worthy of remark , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “ however , that these people are , in their way , very proud . ” “ <unk> ? ” Sir Leicester doubts his hearing .
“ I should not be surprised if they all <unk> abandoned the girl — yes , lover and all — instead of her <unk> them , supposing she remained at Chesney Wold under such circumstances . ” “ Well ! ” says Sir Leicester <unk> .
“ Well !
You should know , Mr. Tulkinghorn .
You have been among them . ” “ Really , Sir Leicester , ” returns the lawyer , “ I state the fact .
Why , I could tell you a story — with Lady Dedlock ’ s permission . ” Her head <unk> it , and Volumnia is enchanted .
A story !
Oh , he is going to tell something at last !
A ghost in it , Volumnia hopes ?
“ No .
<unk> flesh and blood . ” Mr. Tulkinghorn stops for an instant and repeats with some little emphasis <unk> upon his usual <unk> , “ <unk> flesh and blood , Miss Dedlock .
Sir Leicester , these particulars have only lately become known to me .
They are very brief .
They <unk> what I have said .
I <unk> names for the present .
Lady Dedlock will not think me <unk> , I hope ? ” By the light of the fire , which is low , he can be seen looking towards the moonlight .
By the light of the moon Lady Dedlock can be seen , perfectly still .
“ A <unk> of this Mrs. Rouncewell , a man in exactly <unk> circumstances as I am told , had the good fortune to have a daughter who attracted the notice of a great lady .
I speak of really a great lady , not merely great to him , but married to a gentleman of your condition , Sir Leicester . ” Sir Leicester <unk> says , “ Yes , Mr. Tulkinghorn , ” <unk> that then she must have appeared of very considerable moral <unk> indeed in the eyes of an <unk> .
“ The lady was <unk> and beautiful , and had a liking for the girl , and treated her with great kindness , and kept her always near her .
Now this lady preserved a secret under all her greatness , which she had preserved for many years .
In fact , she had in early life been engaged to marry a young <unk> — he was a captain in the army — nothing connected with whom came to any good .
She never did marry him , but she gave birth to a child of which he was the father . ” By the light of the fire he can be seen looking towards the moonlight .
By the moonlight , Lady Dedlock can be seen in <unk> , perfectly still .
“ The captain in the army being dead , she believed herself safe ; but a train of circumstances with which I need not trouble you led to discovery .
As I received the story , they began in an <unk> on her own part one day when she was taken by surprise , which shows how difficult it is for the <unk> of us ( she was very firm ) to be always <unk> .
There was great domestic trouble and amazement , you may suppose ; I leave you to imagine , Sir Leicester , the husband ’ s grief .
But that is not the present point .
When Mr. Rouncewell ’ s <unk> heard of the <unk> , he no more allowed the girl to be <unk> and honoured than he would have suffered her to be trodden <unk> before his eyes .
Such was his pride , that he indignantly took her away , as if from reproach and disgrace .
He had no sense of the honour done him and his daughter by the lady ’ s condescension ; not the least .
He <unk> the girl ’ s position , as if the lady had been the <unk> of <unk> .
That is the story .
I hope Lady Dedlock will excuse its painful nature . ” There are various opinions on the merits , more or less <unk> with Volumnia ’ s .
That fair young creature cannot believe there ever was any such lady and <unk> the whole history on the threshold .
The <unk> <unk> to the debilitated cousin ’ s sentiment , which is in few words — “ no business — Rouncewell ’ s <unk> <unk> . ” Sir Leicester generally refers back in his mind to Wat Tyler and <unk> a <unk> of events on a plan of his own .
There is not much conversation in all , for late hours have been kept at Chesney Wold since the necessary expenses elsewhere began , and this is the first night in many on which the family have been alone .
It is past ten when Sir Leicester begs Mr. Tulkinghorn to ring for candles .
Then the stream of moonlight has swelled into a <unk> , and then Lady Dedlock for the first time moves , and rises , and comes forward to a table for a glass of water .
<unk> cousins , <unk> in the candle glare , crowd round to give it ; Volumnia ( always ready for something better if <unk> ) takes another , a very mild <unk> of which contents her ; Lady Dedlock , graceful , <unk> , looked after by admiring eyes , passes away slowly down the long perspective by the side of that <unk> , not at all improving her as a question of contrast .
CHAPTER <unk> In Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s Room Mr. Tulkinghorn arrives in his <unk> a little breathed by the journey up , though leisurely performed .
There is an expression on his face as if he had discharged his mind of some grave matter and were , in his close way , satisfied .
To say of a man so severely and strictly <unk> that he is triumphant would be to do him as great an injustice as to suppose him troubled with love or sentiment or any romantic weakness .
He is <unk> satisfied .
Perhaps there is a rather increased sense of power upon him as he <unk> <unk> one of his <unk> <unk> with his other hand and holding it behind his back walks <unk> up and down .
There is a <unk> <unk> in the room on which is a pretty large <unk> of papers .
The green lamp is lighted , his <unk> lie upon the desk , the easy-chair is <unk> up to it , and it would seem as though he had intended to bestow an hour or so upon these claims on his attention before going to bed .
But he happens not to be in a business mind .
After a glance at the documents <unk> his notice — with his head bent low over the table , the old man ’ s sight for print or writing being defective at night — he opens the French window and steps out upon the leads .
There he again walks slowly up and down in the same attitude , <unk> , if a man so cool may have any need to <unk> , from the story he has related downstairs .
The time was once when men as knowing as Mr. Tulkinghorn would walk on <unk> in the <unk> and look up into the sky to read their fortunes there .
<unk> of stars are visible to-night , though their <unk> is <unk> by the splendour of the moon .
If he be seeking his own star as he <unk> turns and turns upon the leads , it should be but a pale one to be so <unk> represented below .
If he be <unk> out his <unk> , that may be written in other <unk> nearer to his hand .
As he paces the leads with his eyes most probably as high above his thoughts as they are high above the earth , he is suddenly stopped in passing the window by two eyes that meet his own .
The ceiling of his room is rather low ; and the upper part of the door , which is opposite the window , is of glass .
There is an inner <unk> door , too , but the night being warm he did not close it when he came upstairs .
These eyes that meet his own are looking in through the glass from the <unk> outside .
He knows them well .
The blood has not flushed into his face so suddenly and <unk> for many a long year as when he <unk> Lady Dedlock .
He steps into the room , and she comes in too , closing both the doors behind her .
There is a wild <unk> — is it fear or anger ? — in her eyes .
In her carriage and all else she looks as she looked downstairs two hours ago .
Is it fear or is it anger now ?
He cannot be sure .
Both might be as pale , both as intent .
“ Lady Dedlock ? ” She does not speak at first , nor even when she has slowly dropped into the easy-chair by the table .
They look at each other , like two pictures .
“ Why have you told my story to so many persons ? ” “ Lady Dedlock , it was necessary for me to inform you that I knew it . ” “ How long have you known it ? ” “ I have suspected it a long while — fully known it a little while . ” “ <unk> ? ” “ <unk> . ” He stands before her with one hand on a chair-back and the other in his old-fashioned waistcoat and <unk> , exactly as he has stood before her at any time since her marriage .
The same formal politeness , the same composed deference that might as well be <unk> ; the whole man the same dark , cold object , at the same distance , which nothing has ever <unk> .
“ Is this true concerning the poor girl ? ” He slightly inclines and advances his head as not quite understanding the question .
“ You know what you related .
Is it true ?
Do her friends know my story also ?
Is it the <unk> yet ?
Is it <unk> upon the walls and cried in the streets ? ” So !
<unk> , and fear , and shame .
All three <unk> .
What power this woman has to keep these <unk> <unk> down !
Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s thoughts take such form as he looks at her , with his ragged grey eyebrows a hair ’ s breadth more contracted than usual under her gaze .
“ No , Lady Dedlock .
That was a <unk> case , arising out of Sir Leicester ’ s unconsciously carrying the matter with so high a hand .
But it would be a real case if they knew — what we know . ” “ Then they do not know it yet ? ” “ No . ” “ Can I save the poor girl from injury before they know it ? ” “ Really , Lady Dedlock , ” Mr. Tulkinghorn replies , “ I cannot give a satisfactory opinion on that point . ” And he thinks , with the interest of attentive curiosity , as he watches the struggle in her breast , “ The power and force of this woman are astonishing ! ” “ Sir , ” she says , for the moment obliged to set her lips with all the energy she has , that she may speak distinctly , “ I will make it plainer .
I do not dispute your <unk> case .
I anticipated it , and felt its truth as strongly as you can do , when I saw Mr. Rouncewell here .
I knew very well that if he could have had the power of seeing me as I was , he would consider the poor girl <unk> by having for a moment been , although most innocently , the subject of my great and distinguished patronage .
But I have an interest in her , or I should rather say — no longer belonging to this place — I had , and if you can find so much consideration for the woman under your foot as to remember that , she will be very sensible of your <unk> . ” Mr. Tulkinghorn , profoundly attentive , throws this off with a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> his eyebrows a little more .
“ You have prepared me for my <unk> , and I thank you for that too .
Is there anything that you require of me ?
Is there any claim that I can release or any charge or trouble that I can spare my husband in obtaining HIS release by <unk> to the <unk> of your discovery ?
I will write anything , here and now , that you will <unk> .
I am ready to do it . ” And she would do it , thinks the lawyer , watchful of the firm hand with which she takes the pen !
“ I will not trouble you , Lady Dedlock .
Pray spare yourself . ” “ I have long expected this , as you know .
I neither wish to spare myself nor to be spared .
You can do nothing worse to me than you have done .
Do what remains now . ” “ Lady Dedlock , there is nothing to be done .
I will take leave to say a few words when you have finished . ” Their need for watching one another should be over now , but they do it all this time , and the stars watch them both through the opened window .
<unk> in the moonlight lie the <unk> fields at rest , and the wide house is as quiet as the narrow one .
The narrow one !
Where are the <unk> and the <unk> , this peaceful night , <unk> to add the last great secret to the many secrets of the Tulkinghorn existence ?
Is the man born yet , is the <unk> <unk> yet ?
<unk> questions to consider , more curious perhaps not to consider , under the watching stars upon a summer night .
“ Of <unk> or remorse or any feeling of mine , ” Lady Dedlock presently proceeds , “ I say not a word .
If I were not dumb , you would be deaf .
Let that go by .
It is not for your ears . ” He makes a <unk> of offering a protest , but she sweeps it away with her disdainful hand .
“ Of other and very different things I come to speak to you .
My <unk> are all in their proper places of keeping .
They will be found there .
So , my dresses .
So , all the <unk> I have .
Some ready money I had with me , please to say , but no large amount .
I did not wear my own dress , in order that I might avoid observation .
I went to be <unk> lost .
Make this known .
I leave no other charge with you . ” “ Excuse me , Lady Dedlock , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , quite unmoved .
“ I am not sure that I understand you .
You want — ” “ To be lost to all here .
I leave Chesney Wold to-night .
I go this hour . ” Mr. Tulkinghorn shakes his head .
She rises , but he , without moving hand from chair-back or from old-fashioned waistcoat and <unk> , shakes his head .
“ What ?
Not go as I have said ? ” “ No , Lady Dedlock , ” he very calmly replies .
“ Do you know the relief that my <unk> will be ?
Have you forgotten the <unk> and <unk> upon this place , and where it is , and who it is ? ” “ No , Lady Dedlock , not by any means . ” Without <unk> to <unk> , she moves to the inner door and has it in her hand when he says to her , without himself stirring hand or foot or raising his voice , “ Lady Dedlock , have the goodness to stop and hear me , or before you reach the staircase I shall ring the <unk> and <unk> the house .
And then I must speak out before every guest and servant , every man and woman , in it . ” He has <unk> her .
She falters , <unk> , and puts her hand <unk> to her head .
<unk> tokens these in any one else , but when so <unk> an eye as Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s sees indecision for a moment in such a subject , he thoroughly knows its value .
He promptly says again , “ Have the goodness to hear me , Lady Dedlock , ” and motions to the chair from which she has risen .
She <unk> , but he motions again , and she sits down .
“ The relations between us are of an unfortunate description , Lady Dedlock ; but as they are not of my making , I will not <unk> for them .
The position I hold in reference to Sir Leicester is so well known to you that I can hardly imagine but that I must long have appeared in your eyes the natural person to make this discovery . ” “ Sir , ” she returns without looking up from the ground on which her eyes are now fixed , “ I had better have gone .
It would have been far better not to have detained me .
I have no more to say . ” “ Excuse me , Lady Dedlock , if I add a little more to hear . ” “ I wish to hear it at the window , then .
I can ’ t breathe where I am . ” His jealous glance as she walks that way <unk> an instant ’ s <unk> that she may have it in her thoughts to <unk> over , and <unk> against <unk> and <unk> , strike her life out upon the terrace below .
But a moment ’ s observation of her figure as she stands in the window without any support , looking out at the stars — not up — gloomily out at those stars which are low in the <unk> , <unk> him .
By <unk> round as she has moved , he stands a little behind her .
“ Lady Dedlock , I have not yet been able to come to a decision satisfactory to myself on the course before me .
I am not clear what to do or how to act next .
I must request you , in the meantime , to keep your secret as you have kept it so long and not to wonder that I keep it too . ” He pauses , but she makes no reply .
“ Pardon me , Lady Dedlock .
This is an important subject .
You are honouring me with your attention ? ” “ I am . ” “ Thank you .
I might have known it from what I have seen of your strength of character .
I ought not to have asked the question , but I have the habit of making sure of my ground , step by step , as I go on .
The sole consideration in this unhappy case is Sir Leicester . ” “ Then why , ” she asks in a low voice and without removing her gloomy look from those distant stars , “ do you <unk> me in his house ? ” “ Because he IS the consideration .
Lady Dedlock , I have no occasion to tell you that Sir Leicester is a very proud man , that his reliance upon you is <unk> , that the fall of that moon out of the sky would not <unk> him more than your fall from your high position as his wife . ” She <unk> quickly and heavily , but she stands as <unk> as ever he has seen her in the midst of her <unk> company .
“ I declare to you , Lady Dedlock , that with anything short of this case that I have , I would as soon have hoped to <unk> up by means of my own strength and my own hands the oldest tree on this estate as to shake your hold upon Sir Leicester and Sir Leicester ’ s trust and confidence in you .
And even now , with this case , I <unk> .
Not that he could doubt ( that , even with him , is impossible ) , but that nothing can prepare him for the blow . ” “ Not my flight ? ” she returned .
“ Think of it again . ” “ Your flight , Lady Dedlock , would spread the whole truth , and a hundred times the whole truth , far and wide .
It would be impossible to save the family credit for a day .
It is not to be thought of . ” There is a quiet decision in his reply which admits of no <unk> .
“ When I speak of Sir Leicester being the sole consideration , he and the family credit are one .
Sir Leicester and the <unk> , Sir Leicester and Chesney Wold , Sir Leicester and his <unk> and his <unk> ” — Mr.
Tulkinghorn very dry here — “ are , I need not say to you , Lady Dedlock , <unk> . ” “ Go on ! ” “ Therefore , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , pursuing his case in his <unk> style , “ I have much to consider .
This is to be hushed up if it can be .
How can it be , if Sir Leicester is driven out of his wits or laid upon a <unk> ?
If I <unk> this shock upon him to-morrow morning , how could the immediate change in him be <unk> for ?
What could have caused it ?
What could have divided you ?
Lady Dedlock , the <unk> and the <unk> would come on directly , and you are to remember that it would not <unk> you merely ( whom I cannot at all consider in this business ) but your husband , Lady Dedlock , your husband . ” He gets plainer as he gets on , but not an <unk> more emphatic or animated .
“ There is another point of view , ” he continues , “ in which the case presents itself .
Sir Leicester is devoted to you almost to <unk> .
He might not be able to overcome that <unk> , even knowing what we know .
I am putting an extreme case , but it might be so .
If so , it were better that he knew nothing .
Better for common sense , better for him , better for me .
I must take all this into account , and it <unk> to render a decision very difficult . ” She stands looking out at the same stars without a word .
They are beginning to pale , and she looks as if their <unk> <unk> her .
“ My experience <unk> me , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , who has by this time got his hands in his pockets and is going on in his business consideration of the matter like a <unk> .
“ My experience <unk> me , Lady Dedlock , that most of the people I know would do far better to leave marriage alone .
It is at the bottom of three <unk> of their <unk> .
So I thought when Sir Leicester married , and so I always have thought since .
No more about that .
I must now be guided by circumstances .
In the meanwhile I must beg you to keep your own counsel , and I will keep mine . ” “ I am to <unk> my present life on , holding its pains at your pleasure , day by day ? ” she asks , still looking at the distant sky .
“ Yes , I am afraid so , Lady Dedlock . ” “ It is necessary , you think , that I should be so tied to the stake ? ” “ I am sure that what I recommend is necessary . ” “ I am to remain on this <unk> <unk> on which my miserable <unk> has been so long <unk> , and it is to fall beneath me when you give the signal ? ” she said slowly .
“ Not without notice , Lady Dedlock .
I shall take no step without <unk> you . ” She asks all her questions as if she were repeating them from memory or calling them over in her sleep .
“ We are to meet as usual ? ” “ <unk> as usual , if you please . ” “ And I am to hide my <unk> , as I have done so many years ? ” “ As you have done so many years .
I should not have made that reference myself , Lady Dedlock , but I may now remind you that your secret can be no <unk> to you than it was , and is no worse and no better than it was .
I know it certainly , but I believe we have never wholly trusted each other . ” She stands absorbed in the same frozen way for some little time before asking , “ Is there anything more to be said to-night ? ” “ Why , ” Mr. Tulkinghorn returns <unk> as he softly rubs his hands , “ I should like to be assured of your <unk> in my arrangements , Lady Dedlock . ” “ You may be assured of it . ” “ Good .
And I would wish in conclusion to remind you , as a business precaution , in case it should be necessary to recall the fact in any communication with Sir Leicester , that throughout our interview I have expressly stated my sole consideration to be Sir Leicester ’ s feelings and honour and the family reputation .
I should have been happy to have made Lady Dedlock a prominent consideration , too , if the case had admitted of it ; but <unk> it does not . ” “ I can <unk> your fidelity , sir . ” Both before and after saying it she remains absorbed , but at length moves , and turns , <unk> in her natural and acquired presence , towards the door .
Mr. Tulkinghorn opens both the doors exactly as he would have done yesterday , or as he would have done ten years ago , and makes his old-fashioned bow as she passes out .
It is not an ordinary look that he receives from the handsome face as it goes into the darkness , and it is not an ordinary movement , though a very slight one , that <unk> his <unk> .
But as he <unk> when he is left alone , the woman has been putting no common <unk> upon herself .
He would know it all the better if he saw the woman <unk> her own rooms with her hair <unk> thrown from her <unk> face , her hands clasped behind her head , her figure twisted as if by pain .
He would think so all the more if he saw the woman thus <unk> up and down for hours , without fatigue , without <unk> , followed by the faithful step upon the Ghost ’ s Walk .
But he shuts out the now chilled air , draws the <unk> , goes to bed , and falls asleep .
And truly when the stars go out and the <unk> day peeps into the <unk> , finding him at his oldest , he looks as if the <unk> and the <unk> were both <unk> and would soon be <unk> .
The same <unk> day peeps in at Sir Leicester <unk> the <unk> country in a majestically condescending dream ; and at the cousins entering on various public <unk> , principally receipt of <unk> ; and at the <unk> Volumnia , <unk> a <unk> of fifty thousand pounds upon a hideous old general with a mouth of false teeth like a <unk> too full of keys , long the admiration of Bath and the terror of every other community .
Also into rooms high in the roof , and into offices in <unk> , and over stables , where <unk> ambition <unk> of <unk> , in <unk> ’ lodges , and in <unk> <unk> with Will or <unk> .
Up comes the bright sun , drawing everything up with it — the <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in the earth , the drooping leaves and flowers , the birds and <unk> and creeping things , the <unk> to sweep the <unk> turf and <unk> <unk> velvet where the <unk> passes , the smoke of the great kitchen fire <unk> itself straight and high into the <unk> air .
<unk> , up comes the <unk> over Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s unconscious head cheerfully <unk> that Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock are in their happy home and that there is <unk> at the place in Lincolnshire .
CHAPTER <unk> In Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s <unk> From the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the Dedlock property , Mr. Tulkinghorn <unk> himself to the <unk> heat and dust of London .
His manner of coming and going between the two places is one of his <unk> .
He walks into Chesney Wold as if it were next door to his chambers and returns to his chambers as if he had never been out of Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields .
He neither changes his dress before the journey nor talks of it afterwards .
He melted out of his <unk> this morning , just as now , in the late twilight , he <unk> into his own square .
Like a dingy London bird among the birds at <unk> in these pleasant fields , where the sheep are all made into parchment , the <unk> into wigs , and the <unk> into <unk> , the lawyer , <unk> and faded , dwelling among mankind but not <unk> with them , aged without experience of genial youth , and so long used to make his <unk> <unk> in <unk> and corners of human nature that he has forgotten its <unk> and better <unk> , comes <unk> home .
In the <unk> made by the hot <unk> and hot buildings , he has <unk> himself <unk> than usual ; and he has in his <unk> mind his <unk> <unk> half a century old .
The <unk> is <unk> up and down his <unk> on Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s side of the Fields when that <unk> of noble mysteries arrives at his own dull court-yard .
He <unk> the <unk> and is gliding into the <unk> hall when he <unk> , on the top step , a bowing and <unk> little man .
“ Is that Snagsby ? ” “ Yes , sir .
I hope you are well , sir .
I was just giving you up , sir , and going home . ” “ Aye ?
What is it ?
What do you want with me ? ” “ Well , sir , ” says Mr. Snagsby , holding his hat at the side of his head in his deference towards his best customer , “ I was <unk> to say a word to you , sir . ” “ Can you say it here ? ” “ <unk> , sir . ” “ Say it then . ” The lawyer turns , leans his arms on the iron <unk> at the top of the steps , and looks at the <unk> lighting the court-yard .
“ It is <unk> , ” says Mr. Snagsby in a mysterious low voice , “ it is <unk> — not to put too fine a point upon it — to the foreigner , sir ! ” Mr. Tulkinghorn eyes him with some surprise .
“ What foreigner ? ” “ The foreign female , sir .
French , if I don ’ t mistake ?
I am not acquainted with that language myself , but I should judge from her manners and appearance that she was French ; <unk> , certainly foreign .
Her that was upstairs , sir , when Mr. Bucket and me had the honour of waiting upon you with the <unk> that night . ” “ Oh !
Yes , yes .
Mademoiselle Hortense . ” “ Indeed , sir ? ” Mr. Snagsby coughs his cough of <unk> behind his hat .
“ I am not acquainted myself with the names of <unk> in general , but I have no doubt it <unk> be that . ” Mr. Snagsby appears to have set out in this reply with some desperate <unk> of repeating the name , but on reflection coughs again to excuse himself .
“ And what can you have to say , Snagsby , ” demands Mr. Tulkinghorn , “ about her ? ” “ Well , sir , ” returns the stationer , shading his communication with his hat , “ it falls a little hard upon me .
My domestic happiness is very great — at least , it ’ s as great as can be expected , I ’ m sure — but my little woman is rather given to jealousy .
Not to put too fine a point upon it , she is very much given to jealousy .
And you see , a foreign female of that genteel appearance coming into the shop , and hovering — I should be the last to make use of a strong expression if I could avoid it , but hovering , sir — in the court — you know it is — now ain ’ t it ?
I only put it to yourself , sir . ” Mr. Snagsby , having said this in a very plaintive manner , throws in a cough of general application to fill up all the <unk> .
“ Why , what do you mean ? ” asks Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ Just so , sir , ” returns Mr. Snagsby ; “ I was sure you would feel it yourself and would excuse the <unk> of MY feelings when <unk> with the known <unk> of my little woman .
You see , the foreign female — which you mentioned her name just now , with quite a native sound I am sure — caught up the word Snagsby that night , being uncommon quick , and made inquiry , and got the direction and come at <unk> .
Now Guster , our young woman , is timid and has fits , and she , taking fright at the foreigner ’ s looks — which are fierce — and at a <unk> manner that she has of speaking — which is calculated to alarm a weak mind — gave way to it , instead of bearing up against it , and tumbled down the kitchen stairs out of one into another , such fits as I do sometimes think are never gone into , or come out of , in any house but ours .
Consequently there was by good fortune <unk> occupation for my little woman , and only me to answer the shop .
When she <unk> say that Mr. Tulkinghorn , being always <unk> to her by his <unk> ( which I had no doubt at the time was a foreign mode of <unk> a clerk ) , she would do herself the pleasure of continually calling at my place until she was let in here .
Since then she has been , as I began by saying , hovering , hovering , sir ” — Mr.
Snagsby repeats the word with <unk> emphasis — “ in the court .
The effects of which movement it is impossible to <unk> .
I shouldn ’ t wonder if it might have already given rise to the <unk> mistakes even in the neighbours ’ minds , not mentioning ( if such a thing was possible ) my little woman .
Whereas , goodness knows , ” says Mr. Snagsby , shaking his head , “ I never had an idea of a foreign female , except as being formerly connected with a bunch of <unk> and a baby , or at the present time with a <unk> and <unk> .
I never had , I do assure you , sir ! ” Mr. Tulkinghorn had listened gravely to this complaint and inquires when the stationer has finished , “ And that ’ s all , is it , Snagsby ? ” “ Why yes , sir , that ’ s all , ” says Mr. Snagsby , <unk> with a cough that plainly adds , “ and it ’ s enough too — for me . ” “ I don ’ t know what Mademoiselle Hortense may want or mean , unless she is mad , ” says the lawyer .
“ Even if she was , you know , sir , ” Mr. Snagsby <unk> , “ it wouldn ’ t be a consolation to have some <unk> or another in the form of a foreign <unk> planted in the family . ” “ No , ” says the other .
“ Well , well !
This shall be stopped .
I am sorry you have been <unk> .
If she comes again , send her here . ” Mr. Snagsby , with much bowing and short apologetic coughing , takes his leave , <unk> in heart .
Mr. Tulkinghorn goes upstairs , saying to himself , “ These women were created to give trouble the whole earth over .
The mistress not being enough to deal with , here ’ s the maid now !
But I will be short with <unk> <unk> at least ! ” So saying , he unlocks his door , <unk> his way into his <unk> rooms , lights his candles , and looks about him .
It is too dark to see much of the Allegory overhead there , but that <unk> Roman , who is for ever <unk> out of the clouds and pointing , is at his old work pretty distinctly .
Not honouring him with much attention , Mr. Tulkinghorn takes a small key from his pocket , unlocks a drawer in which there is another key , which unlocks a chest in which there is another , and so comes to the <unk> , with which he prepares to <unk> to the regions of old wine .
He is going towards the door with a candle in his hand when a knock comes .
“ Who ’ s this ?
Aye , aye , mistress , it ’ s you , is it ?
You appear at a good time .
I have just been hearing of you .
Now !
What do you want ? ” He stands the candle on the chimney-piece in the clerk ’ s hall and <unk> his dry cheek with the key as he addresses these words of welcome to Mademoiselle Hortense .
That <unk> <unk> , with her lips tightly shut and her eyes looking out at him sideways , softly closes the door before replying .
“ I have had great deal of trouble to find you , sir . ” “ HAVE you ! ” “ I have been here very often , sir .
It has always been said to me , he is not at home , he is engage , he is this and that , he is not for you . ” “ Quite right , and quite true . ” “ Not true .
<unk> ! ” At times there is a <unk> in the manner of Mademoiselle Hortense so like a bodily spring upon the subject of it that such subject <unk> starts and <unk> back .
It is Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s case at present , though Mademoiselle Hortense , with her eyes almost shut up ( but still looking out sideways ) , is only smiling <unk> and shaking her head .
“ Now , mistress , ” says the lawyer , tapping the key hastily upon the chimney-piece .
“ If you have anything to say , say it , say it . ” “ Sir , you have not use me well .
You have been mean and shabby . ” “ <unk> and shabby , eh ? ” returns the lawyer , rubbing his nose with the key .
“ Yes .
What is it that I tell you ?
You know you have .
You have <unk> me — <unk> me — to give you information ; you have asked me to show you the dress of mine my Lady must have wore that night , you have prayed me to come in it here to meet that boy .
Say !
Is it not ? ” Mademoiselle Hortense makes another spring .
“ You are a <unk> , a <unk> ! ” Mr. Tulkinghorn seems to <unk> as he looks <unk> at her , then he replies , “ Well , <unk> , well .
I paid you . ” “ You paid me ! ” she repeats with fierce <unk> .
“ Two sovereign !
I have not change them , I <unk> them , I <unk> them , I throw them from me ! ” Which she <unk> does , taking them out of her bosom as she speaks and <unk> them with such violence on the floor that they <unk> up again into the light before they roll away into corners and slowly settle down there after <unk> <unk> .
“ Now ! ” says Mademoiselle Hortense , darkening her large eyes again .
“ You have paid me ?
Eh , my God , oh yes ! ” Mr. Tulkinghorn rubs his head with the key while she <unk> herself with a <unk> laugh .
“ You must be rich , my fair friend , ” he composedly observes , “ to throw money about in that way ! ” “ I AM rich , ” she returns .
“ I am very rich in <unk> .
I <unk> my Lady , of all my heart .
You know that . ” “ <unk> it ?
How should I know it ? ” “ Because you have known it perfectly before you prayed me to give you that information .
Because you have known perfectly that I was <unk> ! ” It appears impossible for mademoiselle to roll the letter “ <unk> ” sufficiently in this word , notwithstanding that she <unk> her <unk> <unk> by <unk> both her hands and setting all her teeth .
“ Oh !
I knew that , did I ? ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , examining the wards of the key .
“ Yes , without doubt .
I am not blind .
You have made sure of me because you knew that .
You had reason !
I <unk> her . ” Mademoiselle Hortense folds her arms and throws this last remark at him over one of her shoulders .
“ Having said this , have you anything else to say , mademoiselle ? ” “ I am not yet placed .
Place me well .
<unk> me a good condition !
If you cannot , or do not choose to do that , employ me to pursue her , to <unk> her , to disgrace and to <unk> her .
I will help you well , and with a good will .
It is what YOU do .
Do I not know that ? ” “ You appear to know a good deal , ” Mr. Tulkinghorn retorts .
“ Do I not ?
Is it that I am so weak as to believe , like a child , that I come here in that dress to <unk> that boy only to decide a little <unk> , a wager ?
Eh , my God , oh yes ! ” In this reply , down to the word “ wager ” <unk> , mademoiselle has been <unk> polite and tender , then as suddenly dashed into the <unk> and most <unk> scorn , with her black eyes in one and the same moment very nearly shut and <unk> wide open .
“ Now , let us see , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , tapping his chin with the key and looking <unk> at her , “ how this matter stands . ” “ Ah !
Let us see , ” mademoiselle <unk> , with many angry and tight nods of her head .
“ You come here to make a remarkably modest <unk> , which you have just stated , and it not being <unk> , you will come again . ” “ And again , ” says mademoiselle with more tight and angry nods .
“ And yet again .
And yet again .
And many times again .
In effect , for ever ! ” “ And not only here , but you will go to Mr. Snagsby ’ s too , perhaps ?
That visit not <unk> either , you will go again perhaps ? ” “ And again , ” repeats mademoiselle , <unk> with determination .
“ And yet again .
And yet again .
And many times again .
In effect , for ever ! ” “ Very well .
Now , Mademoiselle Hortense , let me recommend you to take the candle and <unk> up that money of yours .
I think you will find it behind the clerk ’ s <unk> in the corner yonder . ” She merely throws a laugh over her shoulder and stands her ground with folded arms .
“ You will not , eh ? ” “ No , I will not ! ” “ So much the poorer you ; so much the richer I !
Look , mistress , this is the key of my <unk> .
It is a large key , but the keys of <unk> are larger .
In this city there are houses of <unk> ( where the <unk> are , for women ) , the <unk> of which are very strong and heavy , and no doubt the keys too .
I am afraid a lady of your spirit and <unk> would find it an inconvenience to have one of those keys turned upon her for any length of time .
What do you think ? ” “ I think , ” mademoiselle replies without any action and in a clear , obliging voice , “ that you are a miserable wretch . ” “ Probably , ” returns Mr. Tulkinghorn , quietly blowing his nose .
“ But I don ’ t ask what you think of myself ; I ask what you think of the prison . ” “ Nothing .
What does it matter to me ? ” “ Why , it matters this much , mistress , ” says the lawyer , deliberately putting away his handkerchief and adjusting his <unk> ; “ the law is so <unk> here that it <unk> to prevent any of our good English <unk> from being troubled , even by a lady ’ s visits against his desire .
And on his <unk> that he is so troubled , it takes hold of the troublesome lady and shuts her up in prison under hard discipline .
<unk> the key upon her , mistress . ” <unk> with the <unk> .
“ Truly ? ” returns mademoiselle in the same pleasant voice .
“ That is droll !
But — my faith ! — still what does it matter to me ? ” “ My fair friend , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “ make another visit here , or at Mr. Snagsby ’ s , and you shall learn . ” “ In that case you will send me to the prison , perhaps ? ” “ Perhaps . ” It would be <unk> for one in mademoiselle ’ s state of agreeable <unk> to <unk> at the mouth , otherwise a <unk> <unk> <unk> might look as if a very little more would make her do it .
“ In a word , mistress , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “ I am sorry to be <unk> , but if you ever present yourself <unk> here — or there — again , I will give you over to the police .
Their gallantry is great , but they carry troublesome people through the streets in an <unk> manner , <unk> down on a board , my good <unk> . ” “ I will prove you , ” whispers mademoiselle , <unk> out her hand , “ I will try if you dare to do it ! ” “ And if , ” pursues the lawyer without minding her , “ I place you in that good condition of being locked up in <unk> , it will be some time before you find yourself at liberty again . ” “ I will prove you , ” repeats mademoiselle in her former whisper .
“ And now , ” proceeds the lawyer , still without minding her , “ you had better go .
Think twice before you come here again . ” “ Think you , ” she answers , “ twice two hundred times ! ” “ You were dismissed by your lady , you know , ” Mr. Tulkinghorn observes , following her out upon the staircase , “ as the most <unk> and <unk> of women .
Now turn over a new leaf and take warning by what I say to you .
For what I say , I mean ; and what I <unk> , I will do , mistress . ” She goes down without answering or looking behind her .
When she is gone , he goes down too , and returning with his <unk> bottle , <unk> himself to a leisurely enjoyment of its contents , now and then , as he throws his head back in his chair , catching sight of the <unk> Roman pointing from the ceiling .
CHAPTER <unk> Esther ’ s Narrative It matters little now how much I thought of my living mother who had told me evermore to consider her dead .
I could not venture to approach her or to communicate with her in writing , for my sense of the <unk> in which her life was passed was only to be <unk> by my fears of increasing it .
<unk> that my mere existence as a living creature was an <unk> danger in her way , I could not always conquer that terror of myself which had seized me when I first knew the secret .
At no time did I dare to utter her name .
I felt as if I did not even dare to hear it .
If the conversation anywhere , when I was present , took that direction , as it sometimes naturally did , I tried not to hear : I <unk> counted , repeated something that I knew , or went out of the room .
I am conscious now that I often did these things when there can have been no danger of her being spoken of , but I did them in the dread I had of hearing anything that might lead to her <unk> , and to her <unk> through me .
It matters little now how often I recalled the tones of my mother ’ s voice , wondered whether I should ever hear it again as I so longed to do , and thought how strange and desolate it was that it should be so new to me .
It matters little that I watched for every public mention of my mother ’ s name ; that I passed and <unk> the door of her house in town , loving it , but afraid to look at it ; that I once sat in the theatre when my mother was there and saw me , and when we were so wide <unk> before the great company of all degrees that any link or confidence between us seemed a dream .
It is all , all over .
My lot has been so blest that I can relate little of myself which is not a story of goodness and generosity in others .
I may well pass that little and go on .
When we were settled at home again , Ada and I had many <unk> with my guardian of which Richard was the theme .
My dear girl was deeply grieved that he should do their kind cousin so much wrong , but she was so faithful to Richard that she could not bear to blame him even for that .
My guardian was assured of it , and never <unk> his name with a word of <unk> .
“ Rick is mistaken , my dear , ” he would say to her .
“ Well , well !
We have all been mistaken over and over again .
We must trust to you and time to set him right . ” We knew afterwards what we suspected then , that he did not trust to time until he had often tried to open Richard ’ s eyes .
That he had written to him , gone to him , talked with him , tried every gentle and <unk> art his kindness could <unk> .
Our poor devoted Richard was deaf and blind to all .
If he were wrong , he would make <unk> when the Chancery suit was over .
If he were groping in the dark , he could not do better than do his utmost to clear away those clouds in which so much was confused and <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> were the fault of the suit ?
Then let him work the suit out and come through it to his right mind .
This was his <unk> reply .
Jarndyce and Jarndyce had <unk> such possession of his whole nature that it was impossible to place any consideration before him which he did not , with a <unk> kind of reason , make a new argument in favour of his doing what he did .
“ So that it is even more <unk> , ” said my guardian once to me , “ to <unk> with the poor dear fellow than to leave him alone . ” I took one of these opportunities of mentioning my doubts of Mr. Skimpole as a good adviser for Richard .
“ <unk> ! ” returned my guardian , laughing , “ My dear , who would advise with Skimpole ? ” “ <unk> would perhaps have been a better word , ” said I.
“ <unk> ! ” returned my guardian again .
“ Who could be encouraged by Skimpole ? ” “ Not Richard ? ” I asked .
“ No , ” he replied .
“ Such an <unk> , <unk> , <unk> creature is a relief to him and an amusement .
But as to <unk> or encouraging or <unk> a serious station towards anybody or anything , it is simply not to be thought of in such a child as Skimpole . ” “ Pray , cousin John , ” said Ada , who had just joined us and now looked over my shoulder , “ what made him such a child ? ” “ What made him such a child ? ” inquired my guardian , rubbing his head , a little at a loss .
“ Yes , cousin John . ” “ Why , ” he slowly replied , <unk> his head more and more , “ he is all sentiment , and — and <unk> , and — and <unk> , and — and imagination .
And these qualities are not <unk> in him , somehow .
I suppose the people who admired him for them in his youth attached too much importance to them and too little to any <unk> that would have <unk> and <unk> them , and so he became what he is .
Hey ? ” said my guardian , stopping short and looking at us hopefully .
“ What do you think , you two ? ” Ada , glancing at me , said she thought it was a pity he should be an expense to Richard .
“ So it is , so it is , ” returned my guardian hurriedly .
“ That must not be .
We must arrange that .
I must prevent it .
That will never do . ” And I said I thought it was to be regretted that he had ever <unk> Richard to Mr. Vholes for a present of five pounds .
“ Did he ? ” said my guardian with a passing shade of vexation on his face .
“ But there you have the man .
There you have the man !
There is nothing <unk> in that with him .
He has no idea of the value of money .
He <unk> Rick , and then he is good friends with Mr. Vholes and <unk> five pounds of him .
He means nothing by it and thinks nothing of it .
He told you himself , I ’ ll be bound , my dear ? ” “ Oh , yes ! ” said I.
“ <unk> ! ” cried my guardian , quite triumphant .
“ There you have the man !
If he had meant any harm by it or was conscious of any harm in it , he wouldn ’ t tell it .
He tells it as he does it in mere simplicity .
But you shall see him in his own home , and then you ’ ll understand him better .
We must pay a visit to Harold Skimpole and caution him on these points .
Lord bless you , my dears , an infant , an infant ! ” In <unk> of this plan , we went into London on an early day and presented ourselves at Mr. Skimpole ’ s door .
He lived in a place called the <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , where there were at that time a number of poor <unk> <unk> walking about in <unk> , smoking little paper <unk> .
Whether he was a better <unk> than one might have supposed , in consequence of his friend Somebody always paying his rent at last , or whether his <unk> for business rendered it particularly difficult to turn him out , I don ’ t know ; but he had occupied the same house some years .
It was in a state of <unk> quite equal to our expectation .
Two or three of the area <unk> were gone , the <unk> was broken , the <unk> was loose , the <unk> had been pulled off a long time to judge from the rusty state of the <unk> , and dirty <unk> on the steps were the only signs of its being <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> girl who seemed to be bursting out at the <unk> in her gown and the <unk> in her shoes like an <unk> <unk> answered our knock by opening the door a very little way and stopping up the <unk> with her figure .
As she knew Mr. Jarndyce ( indeed Ada and I both thought that she evidently associated him with the receipt of her <unk> ) , she immediately <unk> and allowed us to pass in .
The lock of the door being in a <unk> condition , she then applied herself to <unk> it with the chain , which was not in good action either , and said would we go upstairs ?
We went upstairs to the first floor , still seeing no other furniture than the dirty <unk> .
Mr. Jarndyce without further ceremony entered a room there , and we followed .
It was dingy enough and not at all clean , but furnished with an odd kind of shabby <unk> , with a large <unk> , a sofa , and plenty of <unk> , an easy-chair , and plenty of pillows , a piano , books , drawing <unk> , music , newspapers , and a few <unk> and pictures .
A broken <unk> of glass in one of the dirty windows was <unk> and <unk> over , but there was a little plate of <unk> <unk> on the table , and there was another of <unk> , and another of <unk> , and there was a bottle of light wine .
Mr. Skimpole himself <unk> upon the sofa in a <unk> , drinking some <unk> coffee from an old <unk> cup — it was then about <unk> — and looking at a collection of <unk> in the <unk> .
He was not in the least disconcerted by our appearance , but rose and received us in his usual airy manner .
“ Here I am , you see ! ” he said when we were seated , not without some little difficulty , the greater part of the chairs being broken .
“ Here I am !
This is my <unk> breakfast .
Some men want legs of <unk> and mutton for breakfast ; I don ’ t .
Give me my <unk> , my cup of coffee , and my claret ; I am content .
I don ’ t want them for themselves , but they remind me of the sun .
There ’ s nothing <unk> about legs of <unk> and mutton .
<unk> animal satisfaction ! ” “ This is our friend ’ s <unk> ( or would be , if he ever <unk> ) , his <unk> , his <unk> , ” said my guardian to us .
“ Yes , ” said Mr. Skimpole , turning his bright face about , “ this is the bird ’ s <unk> .
This is where the bird lives and sings .
They <unk> his feathers now and then and <unk> his wings , but he sings , he sings ! ” He handed us the <unk> , repeating in his radiant way , “ He sings !
Not an <unk> note , but still he sings . ” “ These are very fine , ” said my guardian .
“ A present ? ” “ No , ” he answered .
“ No !
Some amiable gardener <unk> them .
His man wanted to know , when he brought them last evening , whether he should wait for the money .
‘ Really , my friend , ’ I said , ‘ I think not — if your time is of any value to you . ’ I suppose it was , for he went away . ” My guardian looked at us with a smile , as though he asked us , “ Is it possible to be worldly with this baby ? ” “ This is a day , ” said Mr. Skimpole , gaily taking a little claret in a <unk> , “ that will ever be remembered here .
We shall call it Saint Clare and Saint Summerson day .
You must see my daughters .
I have a blue-eyed daughter who is my Beauty daughter , I have a Sentiment daughter , and I have a Comedy daughter .
You must see them all .
They ’ ll be enchanted . ” He was going to <unk> them when my guardian interposed and asked him to pause a moment , as he wished to say a word to him first .
“ My dear Jarndyce , ” he cheerfully replied , going back to his sofa , “ as many moments as you please .
Time is no object here .
We never know what o ’ clock it is , and we never care .
Not the way to get on in life , you ’ ll tell me ?
Certainly .
But we DON ’ T get on in life .
We don ’ t pretend to do it . ” My guardian looked at us again , plainly saying , “ You hear him ? ” “ Now , Harold , ” he began , “ the word I have to say relates to Rick . ” “ The dearest friend I have ! ” returned Mr. Skimpole <unk> .
“ I suppose he ought not to be my dearest friend , as he is not on terms with you .
But he is , I can ’ t help it ; he is full of youthful poetry , and I love him .
If you don ’ t like it , I can ’ t help it .
I love him . ” The engaging <unk> with which he made this declaration really had a disinterested appearance and <unk> my guardian , if not , for the moment , Ada too .
“ You are welcome to love him as much as you like , ” returned Mr. Jarndyce , “ but we must save his pocket , Harold . ” “ Oh ! ” said Mr. Skimpole .
“ His pocket ?
Now you are coming to what I don ’ t understand . ” <unk> a little more claret and <unk> one of the <unk> in it , he shook his head and smiled at Ada and me with an ingenuous <unk> that he never could be made to understand .
“ If you go with him here or there , ” said my guardian plainly , “ you must not let him pay for both . ” “ My dear Jarndyce , ” returned Mr. Skimpole , his genial face <unk> by the <unk> of this idea , “ what am I to do ?
If he takes me anywhere , I must go .
And how can I pay ?
I never have any money .
If I had any money , I don ’ t know anything about it .
Suppose I say to a man , how much ?
Suppose the man says to me seven and sixpence ?
I know nothing about seven and sixpence .
It is impossible for me to pursue the subject with any consideration for the man .
I don ’ t go about asking busy people what seven and sixpence is in <unk> — which I don ’ t understand .
Why should I go about asking them what seven and sixpence is in <unk> — which I don ’ t understand ? ” “ Well , ” said my guardian , by no means <unk> with this <unk> reply , “ if you come to any kind of <unk> with Rick , you must borrow the money of me ( never breathing the least allusion to that circumstance ) , and leave the calculation to him . ” “ My dear Jarndyce , ” returned Mr. Skimpole , “ I will do anything to give you pleasure , but it seems an idle form — a <unk> .
Besides , I give you my word , Miss Clare and my dear Miss Summerson , I thought Mr. Carstone was <unk> rich .
I thought he had only to make over something , or to sign a bond , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a bill , or to put something on a file somewhere , to bring down a shower of money . ” “ Indeed it is not so , sir , ” said Ada .
“ He is poor . ” “ No , really ? ” returned Mr. Skimpole with his bright smile .
“ You surprise me . ” “ And not being the richer for trusting in a <unk> <unk> , ” said my guardian , laying his hand <unk> on the sleeve of Mr. Skimpole ’ s <unk> , “ be you very careful not to encourage him in that reliance , Harold . ” “ My dear good friend , ” returned Mr. Skimpole , “ and my dear Miss <unk> , and my dear Miss Clare , how can I do that ?
It ’ s business , and I don ’ t know business .
It is he who <unk> me .
He <unk> from great <unk> of business , presents the brightest prospects before me as their result , and calls upon me to admire them .
I do admire them — as bright prospects .
But I know no more about them , and I tell him so . ” The helpless kind of candour with which he presented this before us , the light-hearted manner in which he was amused by his innocence , the <unk> way in which he took himself under his own protection and <unk> about that curious person , combined with the delightful ease of everything he said exactly to make out my guardian ’ s case .
The more I saw of him , the more unlikely it seemed to me , when he was present , that he could <unk> , conceal , or influence anything ; and yet the less likely that appeared when he was not present , and the less agreeable it was to think of his having anything to do with any one for whom I cared .
<unk> that his examination ( as he called it ) was now over , Mr. Skimpole left the room with a radiant face to fetch his daughters ( his <unk> had run away at various times ) , leaving my guardian quite delighted by the manner in which he had <unk> his childish character .
He soon came back , bringing with him the three young ladies and Mrs. Skimpole , who had once been a beauty but was now a delicate <unk> <unk> suffering under a <unk> of <unk> .
“ This , ” said Mr. Skimpole , “ is my Beauty daughter , <unk> — plays and sings odds and ends like her father .
This is my Sentiment daughter , <unk> — plays a little but don ’ t sing .
This is my Comedy daughter , <unk> — sings a little but don ’ t play .
We all draw a little and <unk> a little , and none of us have any idea of time or money . ” Mrs. Skimpole <unk> , I thought , as if she would have been glad to strike out this <unk> in the family <unk> .
I also thought that she rather impressed her sigh upon my guardian and that she took every opportunity of throwing in another .
“ It is pleasant , ” said Mr. Skimpole , turning his sprightly eyes from one to the other of us , “ and it is <unk> interesting to trace <unk> in families .
In this family we are all children , and I am the youngest . ” The daughters , who appeared to be very fond of him , were amused by this droll fact , particularly the Comedy daughter .
“ My dears , it is true , ” said Mr. Skimpole , “ is it not ?
So it is , and so it must be , because like the dogs in the <unk> , ‘ it is our nature to . ’ Now , here is Miss Summerson with a fine <unk> capacity and a knowledge of details perfectly surprising .
It will sound very strange in Miss Summerson ’ s ears , I dare say , that we know nothing about chops in this house .
But we don ’ t , not the least .
We can ’ t cook anything whatever .
A needle and <unk> we don ’ t know how to use .
We admire the people who possess the practical wisdom we want , but we don ’ t quarrel with them .
Then why should they quarrel with us ?
<unk> and let live , we say to them .
<unk> upon your practical wisdom , and let us live upon you ! ” He laughed , but as usual seemed quite candid and really to mean what he said .
“ We have sympathy , my roses , ” said Mr. Skimpole , “ sympathy for everything .
Have we not ? ” “ Oh , yes , papa ! ” cried the three daughters .
“ In fact , that is our family <unk> , ” said Mr. Skimpole , “ in this <unk> of life .
We are capable of looking on and of being interested , and we DO look on , and we ARE interested .
What more can we do ?
Here is my Beauty daughter , married these three years .
Now I dare say her marrying another child , and having two more , was all wrong in point of <unk> <unk> , but it was very agreeable .
We had our little <unk> on those occasions and <unk> social ideas .
She brought her young husband home one day , and they and their young <unk> have their <unk> upstairs .
I dare say at some time or other Sentiment and Comedy will bring THEIR husbands home and have THEIR <unk> upstairs too .
So we get on , we don ’ t know how , but somehow . ” She looked very young indeed to be the mother of two children , and I could not help <unk> both her and them .
It was evident that the three daughters had grown up as they could and had had just as little <unk> <unk> as <unk> them to be their father ’ s <unk> in his <unk> hours .
His <unk> tastes were <unk> , I observed , in their <unk> <unk> of wearing their hair , the Beauty daughter being in the <unk> manner , the Sentiment daughter <unk> and <unk> , and the Comedy daughter in the arch style , with a good deal of sprightly forehead , and vivacious little <unk> <unk> about the corners of her eyes .
They were dressed to <unk> , though in a most untidy and <unk> way .
Ada and I <unk> with these young ladies and found them wonderfully like their father .
In the meanwhile Mr. Jarndyce ( who had been rubbing his head to a great extent , and hinted at a change in the wind ) talked with Mrs. Skimpole in a corner , where we could not help hearing the <unk> of money .
Mr. Skimpole had previously <unk> to go home with us and had <unk> to dress himself for the purpose .
“ My roses , ” he said when he came back , “ take care of mama .
She is poorly to-day .
By going home with Mr. Jarndyce for a day or two , I shall hear the <unk> sing and preserve my <unk> .
It has been tried , you know , and would be tried again if I remained at home . ” “ That bad man ! ” said the Comedy daughter .
“ At the very time when he knew papa was lying ill by his <unk> , looking at the blue sky , ” <unk> complained .
“ And when the smell of <unk> was in the air ! ” said <unk> .
“ It showed a want of poetry in the man , ” Mr. Skimpole assented , but with perfect good humour .
“ It was coarse .
There was an absence of the finer touches of humanity in it !
My daughters have taken great offence , ” he explained to us , “ at an honest man — ” “ Not honest , papa .
<unk> ! ” they all three <unk> .
“ At a rough kind of fellow — a sort of human <unk> rolled up , ” said Mr. Skimpole , “ who is a <unk> in this neighbourhood and from whom we borrowed a couple of <unk> .
We wanted a couple of <unk> , and we hadn ’ t got them , and therefore of course we looked to a man who HAD got them , to lend them .
Well !
This <unk> person <unk> them , and we wore them out .
When they were worn out , he wanted them back .
He had them back .
He was contented , you will say .
Not at all .
He <unk> to their being worn .
I <unk> with him , and pointed out his mistake .
I said , ‘ Can you , at your time of life , be so <unk> , my friend , as to <unk> that an arm-chair is a thing to put upon a shelf and look at ?
That it is an object to contemplate , to <unk> from a distance , to consider from a point of sight ?
Don ’ t you <unk> that these <unk> were borrowed to be sat upon ? ’ He was unreasonable and <unk> and used <unk> language .
Being as patient as I am at this minute , I addressed another appeal to him .
I said , ‘ Now , my good man , however our business <unk> may <unk> , we are all children of one great mother , Nature .
On this blooming summer morning here you see me ’ ( I was on the sofa ) ‘ with flowers before me , fruit upon the table , the <unk> sky above me , the air full of <unk> , contemplating Nature .
I entreat you , by our common <unk> , not to <unk> between me and a subject so <unk> , the absurd figure of an angry <unk> ! ’ But he did , ” said Mr. Skimpole , raising his laughing eyes in playful astonishment ; “ he did <unk> that ridiculous figure , and he does , and he will again .
And therefore I am very glad to get out of his way and to go home with my friend Jarndyce . ” It seemed to escape his consideration that Mrs. Skimpole and the daughters remained behind to encounter the <unk> , but this was so old a story to all of them that it had become a matter of course .
He took leave of his family with a tenderness as airy and graceful as any other aspect in which he showed himself and rode away with us in perfect <unk> of mind .
We had an opportunity of seeing through some open doors , as we went downstairs , that his own apartment was a <unk> to the rest of the house .
I could have no <unk> , and I had none , that something very <unk> to me at the moment , and ever memorable to me in what <unk> from it , was to happen before this day was out .
Our guest was in such spirits on the way home that I could do nothing but listen to him and wonder at him ; nor was I alone in this , for Ada yielded to the same fascination .
As to my guardian , the wind , which had <unk> to become fixed in the east when we left <unk> <unk> , <unk> completely round before we were a couple of miles from it .
Whether of <unk> <unk> or not in any other matters , Mr. Skimpole had a child ’ s enjoyment of change and bright weather .
In no way <unk> by his <unk> on the road , he was in the drawing-room before any of us ; and I heard him at the piano while I was yet looking after my housekeeping , singing <unk> of <unk> and drinking songs , Italian and German , by the score .
We were all assembled shortly before dinner , and he was still at the piano <unk> <unk> out in his <unk> way little <unk> of music , and talking between <unk> of finishing some <unk> of the ruined old <unk> wall to-morrow , which he had begun a year or two ago and had got tired of , when a card was brought in and my guardian read aloud in a surprised voice , “ Sir Leicester Dedlock ! ” The visitor was in the room while it was yet turning round with me and before I had the power to stir .
If I had had it , I should have hurried away .
I had not even the presence of mind , in my <unk> , to retire to Ada in the window , or to see the window , or to know where it was .
I heard my name and found that my guardian was <unk> me before I could move to a chair .
“ Pray be seated , Sir Leicester . ” “ Mr.
Jarndyce , ” said Sir Leicester in reply as he bowed and seated himself , “ I do myself the honour of calling here — ” “ You do ME the honour , Sir Leicester . ” “ Thank you — of calling here on my road from Lincolnshire to express my regret that any cause of complaint , however strong , that I may have against a gentleman who — who is known to you and has been your host , and to whom therefore I will make no farther reference , should have prevented you , still more ladies under your escort and charge , from seeing whatever little there may be to <unk> a polite and <unk> taste at my house , Chesney Wold . ” “ You are exceedingly obliging , Sir Leicester , and on behalf of those ladies ( who are present ) and for myself , I thank you very much . ” “ It is possible , Mr. Jarndyce , that the gentleman to whom , for the reasons I have mentioned , I <unk> from making further allusion — it is possible , Mr. Jarndyce , that that gentleman may have done me the honour so far to <unk> my character as to induce you to believe that you would not have been received by my <unk> establishment in Lincolnshire with that <unk> , that <unk> , which its members are <unk> to show to all ladies and gentlemen who present themselves at that house .
I merely beg to observe , sir , that the fact is the <unk> . ” My guardian delicately dismissed this remark without making any <unk> answer .
“ It has given me pain , Mr. Jarndyce , ” Sir Leicester <unk> proceeded .
“ I assure you , sir , it has given — me — pain — to learn from the housekeeper at Chesney Wold that a gentleman who was in your company in that part of the county , and who would appear to possess a <unk> taste for the fine arts , was likewise <unk> by some such cause from examining the family pictures with that leisure , that attention , that care , which he might have desired to bestow upon them and which some of them might possibly have <unk> . ” Here he produced a card and read , with much gravity and a little trouble , through his eye-glass , “ Mr.
<unk> — <unk> — Harold — <unk> — <unk> — I beg your pardon — Skimpole . ” “ This is Mr. Harold Skimpole , ” said my guardian , evidently surprised .
“ Oh ! ” exclaimed Sir Leicester , “ I am happy to meet Mr. Skimpole and to have the opportunity of <unk> my personal <unk> .
I hope , sir , that when you again find yourself in my part of the county , you will be under no similar sense of <unk> . ” “ You are very obliging , Sir Leicester Dedlock .
So encouraged , I shall certainly give myself the pleasure and advantage of another visit to your beautiful house .
The <unk> of such places as Chesney Wold , ” said Mr. Skimpole with his usual happy and easy air , “ are public <unk> .
They are good enough to maintain a number of delightful objects for the admiration and pleasure of us poor men ; and not to <unk> all the admiration and pleasure that they yield is to be ungrateful to our <unk> . ” Sir Leicester seemed to approve of this sentiment highly .
“ An artist , sir ? ” “ No , ” returned Mr. Skimpole .
“ A perfectly idle man .
A mere amateur . ” Sir Leicester seemed to approve of this even more .
He hoped he might have the good fortune to be at Chesney Wold when Mr. Skimpole next came down into Lincolnshire .
Mr. Skimpole <unk> himself much <unk> and honoured .
“ Mr.
Skimpole mentioned , ” pursued Sir Leicester , addressing himself again to my guardian , “ mentioned to the housekeeper , who , as he may have observed , is an old and attached <unk> of the family — ” ( “ That is , when I walked through the house the other day , on the occasion of my going down to visit Miss Summerson and Miss Clare , ” Mr. Skimpole <unk> explained to us . )
“ — That the friend with whom he had formerly been staying there was Mr. Jarndyce . ” Sir Leicester bowed to the <unk> of that name .
“ And hence I became aware of the circumstance for which I have <unk> my regret .
That this should have occurred to any gentleman , Mr. Jarndyce , but especially a gentleman formerly known to Lady Dedlock , and indeed <unk> some distant connexion with her , and for whom ( as I learn from my Lady herself ) she <unk> a high respect , does , I assure you , give — me — pain . ” “ Pray say no more about it , Sir Leicester , ” returned my guardian .
“ I am very sensible , as I am sure we all are , of your consideration .
Indeed the mistake was mine , and I ought to <unk> for it . ” I had not once looked up .
I had not seen the visitor and had not even appeared to myself to hear the conversation .
It <unk> me to find that I can recall it , for it seemed to make no impression on me as it passed .
I heard them speaking , but my mind was so confused and my <unk> <unk> of this gentleman made his presence so <unk> to me that I thought I understood nothing , through the rushing in my head and the beating of my heart .
“ I mentioned the subject to Lady Dedlock , ” said Sir Leicester , rising , “ and my Lady informed me that she had had the pleasure of <unk> a few words with Mr. Jarndyce and his wards on the occasion of an accidental meeting during their <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> me , Mr. Jarndyce , to repeat to yourself , and to these ladies , the assurance I have already <unk> to Mr. Skimpole .
<unk> undoubtedly prevent my saying that it would afford me any gratification to hear that Mr. Boythorn had favoured my house with his presence , but those circumstances are confined to that gentleman himself and do not extend beyond him . ” “ You know my old opinion of him , ” said Mr. Skimpole , lightly <unk> to us .
“ An amiable bull who is determined to make every colour <unk> ! ” Sir Leicester Dedlock <unk> as if he could not possibly hear another word in reference to such an individual and took his leave with great ceremony and politeness .
I got to my own room with all possible speed and remained there until I had recovered my <unk> .
It had been very much disturbed , but I was thankful to find when I went downstairs again that they only <unk> me for having been shy and <unk> before the great Lincolnshire baronet .
By that time I had made up my mind that the period was come when I must tell my guardian what I knew .
The possibility of my being brought into contact with my mother , of my being taken to her house , even of Mr. Skimpole ’ s , however <unk> associated with me , receiving <unk> and obligations from her husband , was so painful that I felt I could no longer guide myself without his assistance .
When we had retired for the night , and Ada and I had had our usual talk in our pretty room , I went out at my door again and sought my guardian among his books .
I knew he always read at that hour , and as I drew near I saw the light shining out into the passage from his <unk> .
“ May I come in , guardian ? ” “ Surely , little woman .
What ’ s the matter ? ” “ Nothing is the matter .
I thought I would like to take this quiet time of saying a word to you about myself . ” He put a chair for me , shut his book , and put it by , and turned his kind attentive face towards me .
I could not help observing that it wore that curious expression I had observed in it once before — on that night when he had said that he was in no trouble which I could readily understand .
“ What concerns you , my dear Esther , ” said he , “ concerns us all .
You cannot be more ready to speak than I am to hear . ” “ I know that , guardian .
But I have such need of your advice and support .
Oh !
You don ’ t know how much need I have to-night . ” He looked unprepared for my being so earnest , and even a little alarmed .
“ Or how anxious I have been to speak to you , ” said I , “ ever since the visitor was here to-day . ” “ The visitor , my dear !
Sir Leicester Dedlock ? ” “ Yes . ” He folded his arms and sat looking at me with an air of the <unk> astonishment , <unk> what I should say next .
I did not know how to prepare him .
“ Why , Esther , ” said he , breaking into a smile , “ our visitor and you are the two last persons on earth I should have thought of <unk> together ! ” “ Oh , yes , guardian , I know it .
And I too , but a little while ago . ” The smile passed from his face , and he became <unk> than before .
He crossed to the door to see that it was shut ( but I had seen to that ) and resumed his seat before me .
“ Guardian , ” said I , “ do you remember , when we were <unk> by the <unk> , Lady Dedlock ’ s speaking to you of her sister ? ” “ Of course .
Of course I do . ” “ And <unk> you that she and her sister had <unk> , had gone their several ways ? ” “ Of course . ” “ Why did they separate , guardian ? ” His face quite altered as he looked at me .
“ My child , what questions are these !
I never knew .
No one but themselves ever did know , I believe .
Who could tell what the secrets of those two handsome and proud women were !
You have seen Lady Dedlock .
If you had ever seen her sister , you would know her to have been as resolute and haughty as she . ” “ Oh , guardian , I have seen her many and many a time ! ” “ <unk> her ? ” He <unk> a little , biting his lip .
“ Then , Esther , when you spoke to me long ago of Boythorn , and when I told you that he was all but married once , and that the lady did not die , but died to him , and that that time had had its influence on his later life — did you know it all , and know who the lady was ? ” “ No , guardian , ” I returned , fearful of the light that dimly broke upon me .
“ Nor do I know yet . ” “ Lady Dedlock ’ s sister . ” “ And why , ” I could scarcely ask him , “ why , guardian , pray tell me why were THEY parted ? ” “ It was her act , and she kept its motives in her inflexible heart .
He afterwards did <unk> ( but it was mere <unk> ) that some injury which her haughty spirit had received in her cause of quarrel with her sister had wounded her beyond all reason , but she wrote him that from the date of that letter she died to him — as in literal truth she did — and that the resolution was <unk> from her by her knowledge of his proud temper and his <unk> sense of honour , which were both her nature too .
In consideration for those master points in him , and even in consideration for them in herself , she made the sacrifice , she said , and would live in it and die in it .
She did both , I fear ; certainly he never saw her , never heard of her from that hour .
Nor did any one . ” “ Oh , guardian , what have I done ! ” I cried , giving way to my grief ; “ what sorrow have I innocently caused ! ” “ You caused , Esther ? ” “ Yes , guardian .
<unk> , but most surely .
That <unk> sister is my first remembrance . ” “ No , no ! ” he cried , starting .
“ Yes , guardian , yes !
And HER sister is my mother ! ” I would have told him all my mother ’ s letter , but he would not hear it then .
He spoke so tenderly and <unk> to me , and he put so plainly before me all I had myself imperfectly thought and hoped in my better state of mind , that , <unk> as I had been with <unk> gratitude towards him through so many years , I believed I had never loved him so dearly , never thanked him in my heart so fully , as I did that night .
And when he had taken me to my room and kissed me at the door , and when at last I lay down to sleep , my thought was how could I ever be busy enough , how could I ever be good enough , how in my little way could I ever hope to be <unk> enough of myself , devoted enough to him , and useful enough to others , to show him how I blessed and honoured him .
CHAPTER <unk> The <unk> and the Answer My guardian called me into his room next morning , and then I told him what had been left <unk> on the previous night .
There was nothing to be done , he said , but to keep the secret and to avoid another such encounter as that of yesterday .
He understood my feeling and entirely <unk> it .
He charged himself even with <unk> Mr. Skimpole from improving his opportunity .
One person whom he need not name to me , it was not now possible for him to advise or help .
He wished it were , but no such thing could be .
If her mistrust of the lawyer whom she had mentioned were <unk> , which he scarcely doubted , he <unk> discovery .
He knew something of him , both by sight and by reputation , and it was certain that he was a dangerous man .
Whatever happened , he repeatedly impressed upon me with anxious affection and kindness , I was as innocent of as himself and as unable to influence .
“ Nor do I understand , ” said he , “ that any doubts <unk> towards you , my dear .
Much suspicion may <unk> without that connexion . ” “ With the lawyer , ” I returned .
“ But two other persons have come into my mind since I have been anxious .
Then I told him all about Mr. Guppy , who I feared might have had his vague <unk> when I little understood his meaning , but in whose silence after our last interview I expressed perfect confidence . ” “ Well , ” said my guardian .
“ Then we may dismiss him for the present .
Who is the other ? ” I called to his recollection the French maid and the eager offer of herself she had made to me .
“ Ha ! ” he returned thoughtfully .
“ That is a more <unk> person than the clerk .
But after all , my dear , it was but seeking for a new service .
She had seen you and Ada a little while before , and it was natural that you should come into her head .
She merely proposed herself for your maid , you know .
She did nothing more . ” “ Her manner was strange , ” said I.
“ Yes , and her manner was strange when she took her shoes off and showed that cool <unk> for a walk that might have ended in her <unk> , ” said my guardian .
“ It would be useless <unk> and <unk> to <unk> up such chances and <unk> .
There are very few harmless circumstances that would not seem full of <unk> meaning , so considered .
Be hopeful , little woman .
You can be nothing better than yourself ; be that , through this knowledge , as you were before you had it .
It is the best you can do for everybody ’ s sake .
I , <unk> the secret with you — ” “ And <unk> it , guardian , so much , ” said I.
“ — will be attentive to what passes in that family , so far as I can observe it from my distance .
And if the time should come when I can stretch out a hand to render the least service to one whom it is better not to name even here , I will not fail to do it for her dear daughter ’ s sake . ” I thanked him with my whole heart .
What could I ever do but thank him !
I was going out at the door when he asked me to stay a moment .
<unk> turning round , I saw that same expression on his face again ; and all at once , I don ’ t know how , it <unk> upon me as a new and <unk> possibility that I understood it .
“ My dear Esther , ” said my guardian , “ I have long had something in my thoughts that I have wished to say to you . ” “ Indeed ? ” “ I have had some difficulty in approaching it , and I still have .
I should wish it to be so deliberately said , and so deliberately considered .
Would you object to my writing it ? ” “ Dear guardian , how could I object to your writing anything for ME to read ? ” “ Then see , my love , ” said he with his <unk> smile , “ am I at this moment quite as plain and easy — do I seem as open , as honest and old-fashioned — as I am at any time ? ” I answered in all earnestness , “ Quite . ” With the <unk> truth , for his <unk> hesitation was gone ( it had not lasted a minute ) , and his fine , sensible , cordial , <unk> manner was restored .
“ Do I look as if I suppressed anything , meant anything but what I said , had any reservation at all , no matter what ? ” said he with his bright clear eyes on mine .
I answered , most assuredly he did not .
“ Can you fully trust me , and thoroughly rely on what I <unk> , Esther ? ” “ Most thoroughly , ” said I with my whole heart .
“ My dear girl , ” returned my guardian , “ give me your hand . ” He took it in his , holding me lightly with his arm , and looking down into my face with the same genuine <unk> and <unk> of manner — the old <unk> manner which had made that house my home in a moment — said , “ You have <unk> changes in me , little woman , since the winter day in the <unk> .
First and last you have done me a world of good since that time . ” “ Ah , guardian , what have you done for me since that time ! ” “ But , ” said he , “ that is not to be remembered now . ” “ It never can be forgotten . ” “ Yes , Esther , ” said he with a gentle <unk> , “ it is to be forgotten now , to be forgotten for a while .
You are only to remember now that nothing can change me as you know me .
Can you feel quite assured of that , my dear ? ” “ I can , and I do , ” I said .
“ That ’ s much , ” he answered .
“ That ’ s everything .
But I must not take that at a word .
I will not write this something in my thoughts until you have quite resolved within yourself that nothing can change me as you know me .
If you doubt that in the least degree , I will never write it .
If you are sure of that , on good consideration , send Charley to me this night week — ‘ for the letter . ’ But if you are not quite certain , never send .
<unk> , I trust to your truth , in this thing as in everything .
If you are not quite certain on that one point , never send ! ” “ Guardian , ” said I , “ I am already certain , I can no more be changed in that conviction than you can be changed towards me .
I shall send Charley for the letter . ” He shook my hand and said no more .
Nor was any more said in reference to this conversation , either by him or me , through the whole week .
When the appointed night came , I said to Charley as soon as I was alone , “ Go and knock at Mr. Jarndyce ’ s door , Charley , and say you have come from me — ‘ for the letter . ’ ” Charley went up the stairs , and down the stairs , and along the passages — the <unk> way about the old-fashioned house seemed very long in my listening ears that night — and so came back , along the passages , and down the stairs , and up the stairs , and brought the letter .
“ <unk> it on the table , Charley , ” said I.
So Charley laid it on the table and went to bed , and I sat looking at it without taking it up , thinking of many things .
I began with my <unk> childhood , and passed through those timid days to the heavy time when my aunt lay dead , with her resolute face so cold and set , and when I was more solitary with Mrs. Rachael than if I had had no one in the world to speak to or to look at .
I passed to the altered days when I was so blest as to find friends in all around me , and to be beloved .
I came to the time when I first saw my dear girl and was received into that <unk> affection which was the grace and beauty of my life .
I recalled the first bright <unk> of welcome which had shone out of those very windows upon our <unk> faces on that cold bright night , and which had never <unk> .
I lived my happy life there over again , I went through my illness and recovery , I thought of myself so altered and of those around me so <unk> ; and all this happiness shone like a light from one <unk> figure , represented before me by the letter on the table .
I opened it and read it .
It was so impressive in its love for me , and in the <unk> caution it gave me , and the consideration it showed for me in every word , that my eyes were too often <unk> to read much at a time .
But I read it through three times before I laid it down .
I had thought beforehand that I knew its <unk> , and I did .
It asked me , would I be the mistress of Bleak House .
It was not a love letter , though it expressed so much love , but was written just as he would at any time have spoken to me .
I saw his face , and heard his voice , and felt the influence of his kind <unk> manner in every line .
It addressed me as if our places were <unk> , as if all the good <unk> had been mine and all the feelings they had awakened his .
It dwelt on my being young , and he past the <unk> of life ; on his having <unk> a <unk> age , while I was a child ; on his writing to me with a <unk> head , and knowing all this so well as to set it in full before me for <unk> <unk> .
It told me that I would gain nothing by such a marriage and lose nothing by <unk> it , for no new relation could <unk> the tenderness in which he held me , and whatever my decision was , he was certain it would be right .
But he had considered this step anew since our late confidence and had decided on taking it , if it only served to show me through one poor instance that the whole world would readily <unk> to <unk> the stern <unk> of my childhood .
I was the last to know what happiness I could bestow upon him , but of that he said no more , for I was always to remember that I owed him nothing and that he was my <unk> , and for very much .
He had often thought of our future , and <unk> that the time must come , and <unk> that it might come soon , when Ada ( now very nearly of age ) would leave us , and when our present mode of life must be broken up , had become accustomed to reflect on this proposal .
Thus he made it .
If I felt that I could ever give him the best right he could have to be my <unk> , and if I felt that I could happily and justly become the dear companion of his remaining life , superior to all <unk> chances and changes than death , even then he could not have me <unk> myself <unk> while this letter was yet so new to me , but even then I must have <unk> time for <unk> .
In that case , or in the opposite case , let him be <unk> in his old relation , in his old manner , in the old name by which I called him .
And as to his bright Dame Durden and little housekeeper , she would ever be the same , he knew .
This was the substance of the letter , written throughout with a justice and a dignity as if he were indeed my responsible guardian <unk> <unk> the proposal of a friend against whom in his <unk> he stated the full case .
But he did not hint to me that when I had been better looking he had had this same proceeding in his thoughts and had <unk> from it .
That when my old face was gone from me , and I had no attractions , he could love me just as well as in my <unk> days .
That the discovery of my birth gave him no shock .
That his generosity rose above my <unk> and my inheritance of shame .
That the more I stood in need of such fidelity , the more <unk> I might trust in him to the last .
But I knew it , I knew it well now .
It came upon me as the close of the benignant history I had been pursuing , and I felt that I had but one thing to do .
To devote my life to his happiness was to thank him poorly , and what had I wished for the other night but some new means of thanking him ?
Still I cried very much , not only in the fullness of my heart after reading the letter , not only in the <unk> of the prospect — for it was strange though I had expected the contents — but as if something for which there was no name or <unk> idea were <unk> lost to me .
I was very happy , very thankful , very hopeful ; but I cried very much .
By and by I went to my old glass .
My eyes were red and <unk> , and I said , “ Oh , Esther , Esther , can that be you ! ” I am afraid the face in the glass was going to cry again at this reproach , but I held up my finger at it , and it stopped .
“ That is more like the composed look you <unk> me with , my dear , when you showed me such a change ! ” said I , beginning to let down my hair .
“ When you are mistress of Bleak House , you are to be as cheerful as a bird .
In fact , you are always to be cheerful ; so let us begin for once and for all . ” I went on with my hair now , quite comfortably .
I sobbed a little still , but that was because I had been crying , not because I was crying then .
“ And so Esther , my dear , you are happy for life .
<unk> with your best friends , happy in your old home , happy in the power of doing a great deal of good , and happy in the <unk> love of the best of men . ” I thought , all at once , if my guardian had married some one else , how should I have felt , and what should I have done !
That would have been a change indeed .
It presented my life in such a new and blank form that I rang my housekeeping keys and gave them a kiss before I laid them down in their basket again .
Then I went on to think , as I dressed my hair before the glass , how often had I considered within myself that the deep traces of my illness and the circumstances of my birth were only new reasons why I should be busy , busy , busy — useful , amiable , serviceable , in all honest , <unk> ways .
This was a good time , to be sure , to sit down <unk> and cry !
As to its seeming at all strange to me at first ( if that were any excuse for crying , which it was not ) that I was one day to be the mistress of Bleak House , why should it seem strange ?
Other people had thought of such things , if I had not .
“ Don ’ t you remember , my plain dear , ” I asked myself , looking at the glass , “ what Mrs. Woodcourt said before those <unk> were there about your marrying — ” Perhaps the name brought them to my remembrance .
The dried remains of the flowers .
It would be better not to keep them now .
They had only been preserved in memory of something wholly past and gone , but it would be better not to keep them now .
They were in a book , and it happened to be in the next room — our sitting-room , <unk> Ada ’ s chamber from mine .
I took a candle and went softly in to fetch it from its shelf .
After I had it in my hand , I saw my beautiful darling , through the open door , lying asleep , and I <unk> in to kiss her .
It was weak in me , I know , and I could have no reason for crying ; but I dropped a tear upon her dear face , and another , and another .
<unk> than that , I took the withered flowers out and put them for a moment to her lips .
I thought about her love for Richard , though , indeed , the flowers had nothing to do with that .
Then I took them into my own room and <unk> them at the candle , and they were dust in an instant .
On entering the <unk> next morning , I found my guardian just as usual , quite as frank , as open , and free .
There being not the least <unk> in his manner , there was none ( or I think there was none ) in mine .
I was with him several times in the course of the morning , in and out , when there was no one there , and I thought it not unlikely that he might speak to me about the letter , but he did not say a word .
So , on the next morning , and the next , and for at least a week , over which time Mr. Skimpole <unk> his stay .
I expected , every day , that my guardian might speak to me about the letter , but he never did .
I thought then , growing uneasy , that I ought to write an answer .
I tried over and over again in my own room at night , but I could not write an answer that at all began like a good answer , so I thought each night I would wait one more day .
And I waited seven more days , and he never said a word .
At last , Mr. Skimpole having departed , we three were one afternoon going out for a ride ; and I , being dressed before Ada and going down , came upon my guardian , with his back towards me , standing at the drawing-room window looking out .
He turned on my coming in and said , smiling , “ Aye , it ’ s you , little woman , is it ? ” and looked out again .
I had made up my mind to speak to him now .
In short , I had come down on purpose .
“ Guardian , ” I said , rather hesitating and trembling , “ when would you like to have the answer to the letter Charley came for ? ” “ When it ’ s ready , my dear , ” he replied .
“ I think it is ready , ” said I.
“ Is Charley to bring it ? ” he asked pleasantly .
“ No .
I have brought it myself , guardian , ” I returned .
I put my two arms round his neck and kissed him , and he said was this the mistress of Bleak House , and I said yes ; and it made no difference presently , and we all went out together , and I said nothing to my precious pet about it .
CHAPTER <unk> In Trust One morning when I had done <unk> about with my <unk> of keys , as my beauty and I were walking round and round the garden I happened to turn my eyes towards the house and saw a long thin shadow going in which looked like Mr. Vholes .
Ada had been telling me only that morning of her hopes that Richard might <unk> his ardour in the Chancery suit by being so very earnest in it ; and therefore , not to damp my dear girl ’ s spirits , I said nothing about Mr. Vholes ’ s shadow .
Presently came Charley , lightly winding among the <unk> and <unk> along the <unk> , as rosy and pretty as one of <unk> ’ s <unk> instead of my maid , saying , “ Oh , if you please , miss , would you step and speak to Mr. Jarndyce ! ” It was one of Charley ’ s <unk> that whenever she was charged with a message she always began to deliver it as soon as she beheld , at any distance , the person for whom it was intended .
Therefore I saw Charley asking me in her usual form of words to “ step and speak ” to Mr. Jarndyce long before I heard her .
And when I did hear her , she had said it so often that she was out of breath .
I told Ada I would make haste back and inquired of Charley as we went in whether there was not a gentleman with Mr. Jarndyce .
To which Charley , whose <unk> , I confess to my shame , never did any credit to my <unk> <unk> , replied , “ Yes , miss .
Him as come down in the country with Mr. Richard . ” A more complete contrast than my guardian and Mr. Vholes I suppose there could not be .
I found them looking at one another across a table , the one so open and the other so close , the one so broad and upright and the other so narrow and stooping , the one giving out what he had to say in such a rich ringing voice and the other keeping it in in such a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> manner that I thought I never had seen two people so <unk> .
“ You know Mr. Vholes , my dear , ” said my guardian .
Not with the greatest <unk> , I must say .
Mr. Vholes rose , <unk> and buttoned up as usual , and seated himself again , just as he had seated himself beside Richard in the gig .
Not having Richard to look at , he looked straight before him .
“ Mr.
Vholes , ” said my guardian , eyeing his black figure as if he were a bird of ill omen , “ has brought an ugly report of our most unfortunate Rick . ” <unk> a marked emphasis on “ most unfortunate ” as if the words were rather <unk> of his connexion with Mr. Vholes .
I sat down between them ; Mr. Vholes remained immovable , except that he secretly picked at one of the red <unk> on his yellow face with his black glove .
“ And as Rick and you are happily good friends , I should like to know , ” said my guardian , “ what you think , my dear .
Would you be so good as to — as to speak up , Mr. Vholes ? ” <unk> anything but that , Mr. Vholes observed , “ I have been saying that I have reason to know , Miss Summerson , as Mr. C. ’ s professional adviser , that Mr. C. ’ s circumstances are at the present moment in an embarrassed state .
Not so much in point of amount as <unk> to the peculiar and pressing nature of <unk> Mr. C. has <unk> and the means he has of <unk> or meeting the same .
I have <unk> off many little matters for Mr. C. , but there is a <unk> to <unk> off , and we have reached it .
I have made some advances out of pocket to accommodate these <unk> , but I <unk> look to being <unk> , for I do not pretend to be a man of capital , and I have a father to support in the Vale of Taunton , besides striving to <unk> some little independence for three dear girls at home .
My apprehension is , Mr. C. ’ s circumstances being such , lest it should end in his obtaining leave to part with his commission , which at all events is desirable to be made known to his connexions . ” Mr. Vholes , who had looked at me while speaking , here <unk> into the silence he could hardly be said to have broken , so <unk> was his tone , and looked before him again .
“ <unk> the poor fellow without even his present <unk> , ” said my guardian to me .
“ Yet what can I do ?
You know him , Esther .
He would never accept of help from me now .
To offer it or hint at it would be to drive him to an <unk> , if nothing else did . ” Mr. Vholes <unk> addressed me again .
“ What Mr. Jarndyce remarks , miss , is no doubt the case , and is the difficulty .
I do not see that anything is to be done .
I do not say that anything is to be done .
<unk> from it .
I merely come down here under the seal of confidence and mention it in order that everything may be openly carried on and that it may not be said afterwards that everything was not openly carried on .
My wish is that everything should be openly carried on .
I desire to leave a good name behind me .
If I <unk> merely my own interests with Mr. C. , I should not be here .
So <unk> , as you must well know , would be his objections .
This is not a professional attendance .
This can he charged to nobody .
I have no interest in it except as a member of society and a father — AND a son , ” said Mr. Vholes , who had nearly forgotten that point .
It appeared to us that Mr. Vholes said neither more nor less than the truth in <unk> that he sought to <unk> the responsibility , such as it was , of knowing Richard ’ s situation .
I could only <unk> that I should go down to <unk> , where Richard was then <unk> , and see him , and try if it were possible to <unk> the worst .
Without consulting Mr. Vholes on this point , I took my guardian aside to propose it , while Mr. Vholes <unk> <unk> to the fire and warmed his funeral gloves .
The fatigue of the journey formed an immediate objection on my guardian ’ s part , but as I saw he had no other , and as I was only too happy to go , I got his consent .
We had then merely to dispose of Mr. Vholes .
“ Well , sir , ” said Mr. Jarndyce , “ Miss Summerson will communicate with Mr. Carstone , and you can only hope that his position may be yet <unk> .
You will allow me to order you <unk> after your journey , sir . ” “ I thank you , Mr. Jarndyce , ” said Mr. Vholes , putting out his long black sleeve to check the ringing of the bell , “ not any .
I thank you , no , not a morsel .
My digestion is much <unk> , and I am but a poor knife and fork at any time .
If I was to partake of <unk> food at this period of the day , I don ’ t know what the consequences might be .
Everything having been openly carried on , sir , I will now with your permission take my leave . ” “ And I would that you could take your leave , and we could all take our leave , Mr. Vholes , ” returned my guardian bitterly , “ of a cause you know of . ” Mr. Vholes , whose black <unk> was so deep from head to foot that it had quite <unk> before the fire , <unk> a very unpleasant <unk> , made a short <unk> inclination of his head from the neck and slowly shook it .
“ We whose ambition it is to be looked upon in the light of respectable practitioners , sir , can but put our shoulders to the wheel .
We do it , sir .
At least , I do it myself ; and I wish to think well of my professional <unk> , one and all .
You are sensible of an obligation not to refer to me , miss , in communicating with Mr. C. ? ” I said I would be careful not to do it .
“ Just so , miss .
Good morning .
Mr. Jarndyce , good morning , sir . ” Mr. Vholes put his dead glove , which scarcely seemed to have any hand in it , on my fingers , and then on my guardian ’ s fingers , and took his long thin shadow away .
I thought of it on the outside of the coach , passing over all the sunny landscape between us and London , <unk> the <unk> in the ground as it <unk> along .
Of course it became necessary to tell Ada where I was going and why I was going , and of course she was anxious and distressed .
But she was too true to Richard to say anything but words of pity and words of excuse , and in a more loving spirit still — my dear devoted girl ! — she wrote him a long letter , of which I took charge .
Charley was to be my travelling companion , though I am sure I wanted none and would willingly have left her at home .
We all went to London that afternoon , and finding two places in the <unk> , secured them .
At our usual <unk> , Charley and I were rolling away <unk> with the <unk> letters .
It was a night ’ s journey in those coach times , but we had the <unk> to ourselves and did not find the night very <unk> .
It passed with me as I suppose it would with most people under such circumstances .
At one while my journey looked hopeful , and at another hopeless .
Now I thought I should do some good , and now I wondered how I could ever have supposed so .
Now it seemed one of the most reasonable things in the world that I should have come , and now one of the most unreasonable .
In what state I should find Richard , what I should say to him , and what he would say to me occupied my mind by turns with these two states of feeling ; and the wheels seemed to play one tune ( to which the burden of my guardian ’ s letter set itself ) over and over again all night .
At last we came into the narrow streets of <unk> , and very gloomy they were upon a raw <unk> morning .
The long flat <unk> , with its little <unk> houses , wooden and brick , and its litter of <unk> , and great boats , and <unk> , and bare upright <unk> with <unk> and <unk> , and loose <unk> waste places <unk> with grass and <unk> , wore as dull an appearance as any place I ever saw .
The sea was <unk> under a thick white fog ; and nothing else was moving but a few early <unk> , who , with the <unk> twisted round their bodies , looked as if , tired of their present state of existence , they were <unk> themselves into <unk> .
But when we got into a warm room in an excellent hotel and sat down , comfortably washed and dressed , to an early breakfast ( for it was too late to think of going to bed ) , <unk> began to look more cheerful .
Our little room was like a ship ’ s <unk> , and that delighted Charley very much .
Then the fog began to rise like a curtain , and <unk> of ships that we had had no idea were near appeared .
I don ’ t know how many <unk> the <unk> told us were then lying in the <unk> .
Some of these <unk> were of grand size — one was a large <unk> just come home ; and when the sun shone through the clouds , making <unk> <unk> in the dark sea , the way in which these ships brightened , and <unk> , and changed , <unk> a bustle of boats pulling off from the shore to them and from them to the shore , and a general life and motion in themselves and everything around them , was most beautiful .
The large <unk> was our great attraction because she had come into the <unk> in the night .
She was surrounded by boats , and we said how glad the people on board of her must be to come <unk> .
Charley was curious , too , about the voyage , and about the heat in India , and the <unk> and the <unk> ; and as she picked up such information much <unk> than <unk> , I told her what I knew on those points .
I told her , too , how people in such <unk> were sometimes <unk> and cast on <unk> , where they were saved by the <unk> and humanity of one man .
And Charley asking how that could be , I told her how we knew at home of such a case .
I had thought of sending Richard a note saying I was there , but it seemed so much better to go to him without preparation .
As he lived in <unk> I was a little doubtful whether this was <unk> , but we went out to <unk> .
<unk> in at the gate of the <unk> , we found everything very quiet at that time in the morning , and I asked a sergeant standing on the <unk> where he lived .
He sent a man before to show me , who went up some bare stairs , and knocked with his knuckles at a door , and left us .
“ Now then ! ” cried Richard from within .
So I left Charley in the little passage , and going on to the <unk> door , said , “ Can I come in , Richard ?
It ’ s only Dame Durden . ” He was writing at a table , with a great confusion of clothes , tin cases , books , boots , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> all about the floor .
He was only half dressed — in plain clothes , I observed , not in uniform — and his hair was <unk> , and he looked as wild as his room .
All this I saw after he had heartily <unk> me and I was seated near him , for he started upon hearing my voice and caught me in his arms in a moment .
Dear Richard !
He was ever the same to me .
Down to — <unk> , poor poor fellow ! — to the end , he never received me but with something of his old merry <unk> manner .
“ Good heaven , my dear little woman , ” said he , “ how do you come here ?
Who could have thought of seeing you !
Nothing the matter ?
Ada is well ? ” “ Quite well .
<unk> than ever , Richard ! ” “ Ah ! ” he said , leaning back in his chair .
“ My poor cousin !
I was writing to you , Esther . ” So worn and haggard as he looked , even in the fullness of his handsome youth , leaning back in his chair and crushing the closely written <unk> of paper in his hand !
“ Have you been at the trouble of writing all that , and am I not to read it after all ? ” I asked .
“ Oh , my dear , ” he returned with a hopeless gesture .
“ You may read it in the whole room .
It is all over here . ” I mildly entreated him not to be <unk> .
I told him that I had heard by chance of his being in difficulty and had come to consult with him what could best be done .
“ Like you , Esther , but useless , and so NOT like you ! ” said he with a melancholy smile .
“ I am away on leave this day — should have been gone in another hour — and that is to smooth it over , for my <unk> out .
Well !
Let <unk> be <unk> .
So this calling follows the rest .
I only want to have been in the church to have made the round of all the <unk> . ” “ Richard , ” I urged , “ it is not so hopeless as that ? ” “ Esther , ” he returned , “ it is indeed .
I am just so near disgrace as that those who are put in authority over me ( as the <unk> goes ) would far rather be without me than with me .
And they are right .
<unk> from <unk> and <unk> and all such <unk> , I am not fit even for this employment .
I have no care , no mind , no heart , no soul , but for one thing .
Why , if this <unk> hadn ’ t broken now , ” he said , tearing the letter he had written into fragments and moodily casting them away , by <unk> , “ how could I have gone abroad ?
I must have been <unk> abroad , but how could I have gone ?
How could I , with my experience of that thing , trust even Vholes unless I was at his back ! ” I suppose he knew by my face what I was about to say , but he caught the hand I had laid upon his arm and touched my own lips with it to prevent me from going on .
“ No , Dame Durden !
Two subjects I forbid — must forbid .
The first is John Jarndyce .
The second , you know what .
Call it <unk> , and I tell you I can ’ t help it now , and can ’ t be <unk> .
But it is no such thing ; it is the one object I have to pursue .
It is a pity I ever was <unk> upon to turn out of my road for any other .
It would be wisdom to abandon it now , after all the time , anxiety , and pains I have bestowed upon it !
Oh , yes , true wisdom .
It would be very agreeable , too , to some people ; but I never will . ” He was in that <unk> in which I thought it best not to <unk> his determination ( if anything could <unk> it ) by <unk> him .
I took out Ada ’ s letter and put it in his hand .
“ Am I to read it now ? ” he asked .
As I told him yes , he laid it on the table , and resting his head upon his hand , began .
He had not read far when he rested his head upon his two hands — to hide his face from me .
In a little while he rose as if the light were bad and went to the window .
He finished reading it there , with his back towards me , and after he had finished and had folded it up , stood there for some minutes with the letter in his hand .
When he came back to his chair , I saw tears in his eyes .
“ Of course , Esther , you know what she says here ? ” He spoke in a softened voice and kissed the letter as he asked me .
“ Yes , Richard . ” “ <unk> me , ” he went on , tapping his foot upon the floor , “ the little inheritance she is certain of so soon — just as little and as much as I have <unk> — and begs and <unk> me to take it , set myself right with it , and remain in the service . ” “ I know your welfare to be the dearest wish of her heart , ” said I.
“ And , oh , my dear Richard , Ada ’ s is a noble heart . ” “ I am sure it is .
I — I wish I was dead ! ” He went back to the window , and laying his arm across it , leaned his head down on his arm .
It greatly affected me to see him so , but I hoped he might become more yielding , and I remained silent .
My experience was very limited ; I was not at all prepared for his <unk> himself out of this emotion to a new sense of injury .
“ And this is the heart that the same John Jarndyce , who is not otherwise to be mentioned between us , <unk> in to <unk> from me , ” said he indignantly .
“ And the dear girl makes me this generous offer from under the same John Jarndyce ’ s roof , and with the same John Jarndyce ’ s gracious consent and <unk> , I dare say , as a new means of buying me off . ” “ Richard ! ” I cried out , rising hastily .
“ I will not hear you say such <unk> words ! ” I was very angry with him indeed , for the first time in my life , but it only lasted a moment .
When I saw his worn young face looking at me as if he were sorry , I put my hand on his shoulder and said , “ If you please , my dear Richard , do not speak in such a tone to me .
<unk> ! ” He <unk> himself exceedingly and told me in the most generous manner that he had been very wrong and that he begged my pardon a thousand times .
At that I laughed , but trembled a little too , for I was rather fluttered after being so fiery .
“ To accept this offer , my dear Esther , ” said he , sitting down beside me and resuming our conversation , “ — once more , pray , pray forgive me ; I am deeply grieved — to accept my dearest cousin ’ s offer is , I need not say , impossible .
Besides , I have letters and papers that I could show you which would <unk> you it is all over here .
I have done with the red coat , believe me .
But it is some satisfaction , in the midst of my <unk> and <unk> , to know that I am pressing Ada ’ s interests in pressing my own .
Vholes has his shoulder to the wheel , and he cannot help <unk> it on as much for her as for me , thank God ! ” His sanguine hopes were rising within him and lighting up his features , but they made his face more sad to me than it had been before .
“ No , no ! ” cried Richard <unk> .
“ If every <unk> of Ada ’ s little fortune were mine , no part of it should be spent in <unk> me in what I am not fit for , can take no interest in , and am weary of .
It should be devoted to what <unk> a better return , and should be used where she has a larger stake .
Don ’ t be uneasy for me !
I shall now have only one thing on my mind , and Vholes and I will work it .
I shall not be without means .
<unk> of my commission , I shall be able to compound with some small <unk> who will hear of nothing but their bond now — Vholes says so .
I should have a balance in my favour <unk> , but that would swell it .
Come , come !
You shall carry a letter to Ada from me , Esther , and you must both of you be more hopeful of me and not believe that I am quite cast away just yet , my dear . ” I will not repeat what I said to Richard .
I know it was tiresome , and nobody is to suppose for a moment that it was at all wise .
It only came from my heart .
He heard it patiently and feelingly , but I saw that on the two subjects he had reserved it was at present hopeless to make any <unk> to him .
I saw too , and had experienced in this very interview , the sense of my guardian ’ s remark that it was even more <unk> to use <unk> with him than to leave him as he was .
Therefore I was driven at last to asking Richard if he would mind <unk> me that it really was all over there , as he had said , and that it was not his mere impression .
He showed me without hesitation a correspondence making it quite plain that his <unk> was arranged .
I found , from what he told me , that Mr. Vholes had copies of these papers and had been in <unk> with him throughout .
<unk> <unk> this , and having been the <unk> of Ada ’ s letter , and being ( as I was going to be ) Richard ’ s companion back to London , I had done no good by coming down .
<unk> this to myself with a <unk> heart , I said I would return to the hotel and wait until he joined me there , so he threw a cloak over his shoulders and saw me to the gate , and Charley and I went back along the <unk> .
There was a <unk> of people in one spot , <unk> some <unk> officers who were landing from a <unk> , and pressing about them with unusual interest .
I said to Charley this would be one of the great <unk> ’ s boats now , and we stopped to look .
The gentlemen came slowly up from the <unk> , speaking good-humouredly to each other and to the people around and glancing about them as if they were glad to be in England again .
“ Charley , Charley , ” said I , “ come away ! ” And I hurried on so swiftly that my little maid was surprised .
It was not until we were shut up in our <unk> and I had had time to take breath that I began to think why I had made such haste .
In one of the sunburnt faces I had recognized Mr. Allan Woodcourt , and I had been afraid of his <unk> me .
I had been unwilling that he should see my altered looks .
I had been taken by surprise , and my courage had quite failed me .
But I knew this would not do , and I now said to myself , “ My dear , there is no reason — there is and there can be no reason at all — why it should be worse for you now than it ever has been .
What you were last month , you are to-day ; you are no worse , you are no better .
This is not your resolution ; call it up , Esther , call it up ! ” I was in a great tremble — with running — and at first was quite unable to calm myself ; but I got better , and I was very glad to know it .
The party came to the hotel .
I heard them speaking on the staircase .
I was sure it was the same gentlemen because I knew their voices again — I mean I knew Mr. Woodcourt ’ s .
It would still have been a great relief to me to have gone away without making myself known , but I was determined not to do so .
“ No , my dear , no .
No , no , no ! ” I <unk> my bonnet and put my veil half up — I think I mean half down , but it matters very little — and wrote on one of my cards that I happened to be there with Mr. Richard Carstone , and I sent it in to Mr. Woodcourt .
He came immediately .
I told him I was rejoiced to be by chance among the first to welcome him home to England .
And I saw that he was very sorry for me .
“ You have been in shipwreck and <unk> since you left us , Mr. Woodcourt , ” said I , “ but we can hardly call that a misfortune which <unk> you to be so useful and so brave .
We read of it with the <unk> interest .
It first came to my knowledge through your old patient , poor Miss Flite , when I was recovering from my severe illness . ” “ Ah !
Little Miss Flite ! ” he said .
“ She lives the same life yet ? ” “ Just the same . ” I was so comfortable with myself now as not to mind the veil and to be able to put it aside .
“ Her gratitude to you , Mr. Woodcourt , is delightful .
She is a most affectionate creature , as I have reason to say . ” “ You — you have found her so ? ” he returned .
“ I — I am glad of that . ” He was so very sorry for me that he could scarcely speak .
“ I assure you , ” said I , “ that I was deeply touched by her sympathy and pleasure at the time I have referred to . ” “ I was grieved to hear that you had been very ill . ” “ I was very ill . ” “ But you have quite recovered ? ” “ I have quite recovered my health and my cheerfulness , ” said I.
“ You know how good my guardian is and what a happy life we lead , and I have everything to be thankful for and nothing in the world to desire . ” I felt as if he had greater <unk> for me than I had ever had for myself .
It inspired me with new <unk> and new calmness to find that it was I who was under the necessity of <unk> him .
I spoke to him of his voyage out and home , and of his future plans , and of his probable return to India .
He said that was very doubtful .
He had not found himself more favoured by fortune there than here .
He had gone out a poor ship ’ s surgeon and had come home nothing better .
While we were talking , and when I was glad to believe that I had <unk> ( if I may use such a term ) the shock he had had in seeing me , Richard came in .
He had heard downstairs who was with me , and they met with cordial pleasure .
I saw that after their first <unk> were over , and when they spoke of Richard ’ s career , Mr. Woodcourt had a perception that all was not going well with him .
He frequently glanced at his face as if there were something in it that gave him pain , and more than once he looked towards me as though he sought to <unk> whether I knew what the truth was .
Yet Richard was in one of his sanguine states and in good spirits and was thoroughly pleased to see Mr. Woodcourt again , whom he had always liked .
Richard proposed that we all should go to London together ; but Mr. Woodcourt , having to remain by his ship a little longer , could not join us .
He <unk> with us , however , at an early hour , and became so much more like what he used to be that I was still more at peace to think I had been able to soften his <unk> .
Yet his mind was not relieved of Richard .
When the coach was almost ready and Richard ran down to look after his <unk> , he spoke to me about him .
I was not sure that I had a right to lay his whole story open , but I referred in a few words to his <unk> from Mr Jarndyce and to his being <unk> in the ill-fated Chancery suit .
Mr. Woodcourt listened with interest and expressed his regret .
“ I saw you observe him rather closely , ” said I , “ Do you think him so changed ? ” “ He is changed , ” he returned , shaking his head .
I felt the blood rush into my face for the first time , but it was only an <unk> emotion .
I turned my head aside , and it was gone .
“ It is not , ” said Mr. Woodcourt , “ his being so much younger or older , or <unk> or <unk> , or <unk> or <unk> , as there being upon his face such a singular expression .
I never saw so remarkable a look in a young person .
One cannot say that it is all anxiety or all <unk> ; yet it is both , and like <unk> despair . ” “ You do not think he is ill ? ” said I.
No .
He looked <unk> in body .
“ That he cannot be at peace in mind , we have too much reason to know , ” I proceeded .
“ Mr.
Woodcourt , you are going to London ? ” “ <unk> or the next day . ” “ There is nothing Richard wants so much as a friend .
He always liked you .
Pray see him when you get there .
Pray help him sometimes with your <unk> if you can .
You do not know of what service it might be .
You cannot think how Ada , and Mr. Jarndyce , and even I — how we should all thank you , Mr. Woodcourt ! ” “ Miss Summerson , ” he said , more moved than he had been from the first , “ before heaven , I will be a true friend to him !
I will accept him as a trust , and it shall be a sacred one ! ” “ God bless you ! ” said I , with my eyes filling fast ; but I thought they might , when it was not for myself .
“ Ada loves him — we all love him , but Ada loves him as we cannot .
I will tell her what you say .
Thank you , and God bless you , in her name ! ” Richard came back as we finished <unk> these hurried words and gave me his arm to take me to the coach .
“ Woodcourt , ” he said , unconscious with what application , “ pray let us meet in London ! ” “ <unk> ? ” returned the other .
“ I have scarcely a friend there now but you .
Where shall I find you ? ” “ Why , I must get a lodging of some sort , ” said Richard , pondering .
“ Say at Vholes ’ s , Symond ’ s Inn . ” “ Good !
Without loss of time . ” They shook hands heartily .
When I was seated in the coach and Richard was yet standing in the street , Mr. Woodcourt laid his friendly hand on Richard ’ s shoulder and looked at me .
I understood him and <unk> mine in thanks .
And in his last look as we drove away , I saw that he was very sorry for me .
I was glad to see it .
I felt for my old self as the dead may feel if they ever <unk> these <unk> .
I was glad to be tenderly remembered , to be gently pitied , not to be quite forgotten .
CHAPTER <unk> Stop Him !
<unk> rests upon <unk> ’ s .
<unk> and <unk> since the sun went down last night , it has gradually swelled until it fills every void in the place .
For a time there were some <unk> lights burning , as the lamp of life <unk> in Tom-all-Alone ’ s , heavily , heavily , in the <unk> air , and winking — as that lamp , too , winks in Tom-all-Alone ’ s — at many horrible things .
But they are blotted out .
The moon has eyed Tom with a dull cold stare , as <unk> some <unk> <unk> of herself in his desert region <unk> for life and <unk> by <unk> fires ; but she has passed on and is gone .
The <unk> <unk> in the infernal stables <unk> on Tom-all-Alone ’ s , and Tom is fast asleep .
Much mighty <unk> there has been , both in and out of Parliament , concerning Tom , and much <unk> <unk> how Tom shall be got right .
Whether he shall be put into the main road by <unk> , or by <unk> , or by <unk> , or by force of figures , or by correct principles of taste , or by high church , or by low church , or by no church ; whether he shall be set to <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with the crooked knife of his mind or whether he shall be put to <unk> instead .
In the midst of which dust and noise there is but one thing perfectly clear , to wit , that Tom only may and can , or shall and will , be <unk> according to somebody ’ s <unk> but nobody ’ s practice .
And in the hopeful meantime , Tom goes to <unk> head foremost in his old determined spirit .
But he has his <unk> .
Even the winds are his <unk> , and they serve him in these hours of darkness .
There is not a drop of Tom ’ s <unk> blood but <unk> <unk> and <unk> somewhere .
It shall <unk> , this very night , the choice stream ( in which <unk> on <unk> would find the genuine <unk> ) of a <unk> house , and his <unk> shall not be able to say <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
There is not an <unk> of Tom ’ s <unk> , not a <unk> <unk> of any <unk> gas in which he lives , not one <unk> or <unk> about him , not an ignorance , not a <unk> , not a <unk> of his <unk> , but shall work its <unk> through every order of society up to the <unk> of the proud and to the highest of the high .
<unk> , what with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , Tom has his <unk> .
It is a <unk> point whether Tom-all-Alone ’ s be <unk> by day or by night , but on the argument that the more that is seen of it the more shocking it must be , and that no part of it left to the imagination is at all likely to be made so bad as the reality , day carries it .
The day begins to break now ; and in truth it might be better for the national glory even that the sun should sometimes set upon the British <unk> than that it should ever rise upon so <unk> a wonder as Tom .
A brown sunburnt gentleman , who appears in some <unk> for sleep to be wandering abroad rather than <unk> the hours on a restless pillow , <unk> <unk> at this quiet time .
<unk> by curiosity , he often pauses and looks about him , up and down the miserable <unk> .
Nor is he merely curious , for in his bright dark eye there is compassionate interest ; and as he looks here and there , he seems to understand such <unk> and to have <unk> it before .
On the <unk> of the stagnant <unk> of mud which is the main street of Tom-all-Alone ’ s , nothing is to be seen but the crazy houses , shut up and silent .
No waking creature save himself appears except in one direction , where he sees the solitary figure of a woman sitting on a door-step .
He walks that way .
<unk> , he observes that she has <unk> a long distance and is <unk> and <unk> .
She sits on the door-step in the manner of one who is waiting , with her elbow on her knee and her head upon her hand .
<unk> her is a <unk> bag , or bundle , she has carried .
She is <unk> probably , for she gives no <unk> to his steps as he comes <unk> her .
The broken <unk> is so narrow that when Allan Woodcourt comes to where the woman sits , he has to turn into the road to pass her .
<unk> down at her face , his eye meets hers , and he stops .
“ What is the matter ? ” “ Nothing , sir . ” “ Can ’ t you make them hear ?
Do you want to be let in ? ” “ I ’ m waiting till they get up at another house — a <unk> — not here , ” the woman patiently returns .
“ I ’ m waiting here because there will be sun here presently to warm me . ” “ I am afraid you are tired .
I am sorry to see you sitting in the street . ” “ Thank you , sir .
It don ’ t matter . ” A habit in him of speaking to the poor and of <unk> patronage or condescension or <unk> ( which is the favourite <unk> , many people <unk> it quite a <unk> to talk to them like little <unk> books ) has put him on good terms with the woman easily .
“ Let me look at your forehead , ” he says , bending down .
“ I am a doctor .
Don ’ t be afraid .
I wouldn ’ t hurt you for the world . ” He knows that by touching her with his <unk> and accustomed hand he can <unk> her yet more readily .
She makes a slight objection , saying , “ It ’ s nothing ” ; but he has scarcely laid his fingers on the wounded place when she lifts it up to the light .
“ Aye !
A bad <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> broken .
This must be very <unk> . ” “ It do ache a little , sir , ” returns the woman with a started tear upon her cheek .
“ Let me try to make it more comfortable .
My handkerchief won ’ t hurt you . ” “ Oh , dear no , sir , I ’ m sure of that ! ” He <unk> the injured place and <unk> it , and having carefully examined it and gently pressed it with the palm of his hand , takes a small case from his pocket , dresses it , and <unk> it up .
While he is thus employed , he says , after laughing at his <unk> a <unk> in the street , “ And so your husband is a brickmaker ? ” “ How do you know that , sir ? ” asks the woman , astonished .
“ Why , I suppose so from the colour of the <unk> upon your bag and on your dress .
And I know <unk> go about working at <unk> in different places .
And I am sorry to say I have known them cruel to their wives too . ” The woman hastily lifts up her eyes as if she would deny that her injury is <unk> to such a cause .
But feeling the hand upon her forehead , and seeing his busy and composed face , she quietly drops them again .
“ Where is he now ? ” asks the surgeon .
“ He got into trouble last night , sir ; but he ’ ll look for me at the <unk> . ” “ He will get into worse trouble if he often <unk> his large and heavy hand as he has <unk> it here .
But you forgive him , <unk> as he is , and I say no more of him , except that I wish he <unk> it .
You have no young child ? ” The woman shakes her head .
“ One as I calls mine , sir , but it ’ s Liz ’ s . ” “ Your own is dead .
I see !
Poor little thing ! ” By this time he has finished and is putting up his case .
“ I suppose you have some settled home .
Is it far from here ? ” he asks , good-humouredly making light of what he has done as she gets up and <unk> .
“ It ’ s a good two or three and twenty mile from here , sir .
At Saint Albans .
You know Saint Albans , sir ?
I thought you gave a start like , as if you did . ” “ Yes , I know something of it .
And now I will ask you a question in return .
Have you money for your lodging ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” she says , “ really and truly . ” And she shows it .
He tells her , in acknowledgment of her many subdued thanks , that she is very welcome , gives her good day , and walks away .
Tom-all-Alone ’ s is still asleep , and nothing is <unk> .
Yes , something is !
As he <unk> his way to the point from which he <unk> the woman at a distance sitting on the step , he sees a ragged figure coming very <unk> along , <unk> close to the <unk> walls — which the <unk> figure might as well avoid — and <unk> <unk> a hand before it .
It is the figure of a youth whose face is hollow and whose eyes have an <unk> glare .
He is so intent on getting along <unk> that even the <unk> of a stranger in whole <unk> does not <unk> him to look back .
He shades his face with his ragged elbow as he passes on the other side of the way , and goes <unk> and creeping on with his anxious hand before him and his <unk> clothes hanging in <unk> .
<unk> made for what purpose , or of what material , it would be impossible to say .
They look , in colour and in substance , like a bundle of <unk> leaves of <unk> growth that <unk> long ago .
Allan Woodcourt pauses to look after him and note all this , with a shadowy belief that he has seen the boy before .
He cannot recall how or where , but there is some association in his mind with such a form .
He <unk> that he must have seen it in some hospital or refuge , still , cannot make out why it comes with any special force on his remembrance .
He is gradually <unk> from Tom-all-Alone ’ s in the morning light , thinking about it , when he hears running feet behind him , and looking round , sees the boy <unk> towards him at great speed , followed by the woman .
“ Stop him , stop him ! ” cries the woman , almost breathless .
“ Stop him , sir ! ” He <unk> across the road into the boy ’ s path , but the boy is <unk> than he , makes a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> under his hands , comes up half-a-dozen yards beyond him , and <unk> away again .
Still the woman follows , crying , “ Stop him , sir , pray stop him ! ” Allan , not knowing but that he has just robbed her of her money , follows in <unk> and runs so hard that he runs the boy down a dozen times , but each time he repeats the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and <unk> away again .
To strike at him on any of these occasions would be to fell and <unk> him , but the <unk> cannot resolve to do that , and so the grimly ridiculous pursuit continues .
At last the <unk> , <unk> , takes to a narrow passage and a court which has no thoroughfare .
Here , against a hoarding of decaying timber , he is brought to <unk> and <unk> down , lying <unk> at his <unk> , who stands and gasps at him until the woman comes up .
“ Oh , you , Jo ! ” cries the woman .
“ What ?
I have found you at last ! ” “ Jo , ” repeats Allan , looking at him with attention , “ Jo !
<unk> .
To be sure !
I recollect this lad some time ago being brought before the coroner . ” “ Yes , I see you once afore at the inkwhich , ” <unk> Jo .
“ What of that ?
Can ’ t you never let such an unfortnet as me alone ?
An ’ t I unfortnet enough for you yet ?
How unfortnet do you want me fur to be ?
I ’ ve been <unk> and <unk> , <unk> by one on you and <unk> by another on you , till I ’ m <unk> to <unk> and bones .
The inkwhich warn ’ t MY fault .
I done nothink .
He wos wery good to me , he wos ; he wos the only one I <unk> to speak to , as ever come across my crossing .
It ain ’ t wery likely I should want him to be <unk> .
I only wish I wos , myself .
I don ’ t know why I don ’ t go and make a <unk> in the water , I ’ m sure I don ’ t . ” He says it with such a <unk> air , and his <unk> tears appear so real , and he lies in the corner up against the hoarding so like a growth of <unk> or any unwholesome <unk> produced there in <unk> and <unk> , that Allan Woodcourt is softened towards him .
He says to the woman , “ <unk> creature , what has he done ? ” To which she only replies , shaking her head at the <unk> figure more <unk> than angrily , “ Oh , you Jo , you Jo .
I have found you at last ! ” “ What has he done ? ” says Allan .
“ Has he robbed you ? ” “ No , sir , no .
<unk> me ?
He did nothing but what was <unk> by me , and that ’ s the wonder of it . ” Allan looks from Jo to the woman , and from the woman to Jo , waiting for one of them to <unk> the <unk> .
“ But he was along with me , sir , ” says the woman .
“ Oh , you Jo !
He was along with me , sir , down at Saint Albans , ill , and a young lady , Lord bless her for a good friend to me , took pity on him when I <unk> ’ t , and took him home — ” Allan <unk> back from him with a sudden horror .
“ Yes , sir , yes .
Took him home , and made him comfortable , and like a <unk> monster he ran away in the night and never has been seen or heard of since till I set eyes on him just now .
And that young lady that was such a pretty dear caught his illness , lost her beautiful looks , and wouldn ’ t hardly be known for the same young lady now if it wasn ’ t for her angel temper , and her pretty shape , and her sweet voice .
Do you know it ?
You ungrateful wretch , do you know that this is all along of you and of her goodness to you ? ” demands the woman , beginning to rage at him as she recalls it and breaking into passionate tears .
The boy , in rough sort <unk> by what he hears , falls to <unk> his dirty forehead with his dirty palm , and to staring at the ground , and to shaking from head to foot until the crazy hoarding against which he leans rattles .
Allan <unk> the woman , merely by a quiet gesture , but <unk> .
“ Richard told me — ” He falters .
“ I mean , I have heard of this — don ’ t mind me for a moment , I will speak presently . ” He turns away and stands for a while looking out at the covered passage .
When he comes back , he has recovered his composure , except that he <unk> against an <unk> of the boy , which is so very remarkable that it <unk> the woman ’ s attention .
“ You hear what she says .
But get up , get up ! ” Jo , shaking and chattering , slowly rises and stands , after the manner of his <unk> in a difficulty , sideways against the hoarding , resting one of his high shoulders against it and <unk> rubbing his right hand over his left and his left foot over his right .
“ You hear what she says , and I know it ’ s true .
Have you been here ever since ? ” “ <unk> if I seen Tom-all-Alone ’ s till this blessed morning , ” replies Jo <unk> .
“ Why have you come here now ? ” Jo looks all round the confined court , looks at his <unk> no higher than the knees , and finally answers , “ I don ’ t know how to do nothink , and I can ’ t get nothink to do .
I ’ m wery poor and ill , and I thought I ’ d come back here when there warn ’ t nobody about , and lay down and hide somewheres as I knows on till <unk> dark , and then go and beg a trifle of Mr. Snagsby .
He wos allus <unk> fur to give me <unk> he wos , though Mrs. Snagsby she was allus <unk> on me — like everybody <unk> . ” “ Where have you come from ? ” Jo looks all round the court again , looks at his <unk> ’ s knees again , and concludes by laying his <unk> against the hoarding in a sort of resignation .
“ Did you hear me ask you where you have come from ? ” “ <unk> then , ” says Jo .
“ Now tell me , ” proceeds Allan , making a strong effort to overcome his <unk> , going very near to him , and leaning over him with an expression of confidence , “ tell me how it came about that you left that house when the good young lady had been so unfortunate as to pity you and take you home . ” Jo suddenly comes out of his resignation and <unk> declares , addressing the woman , that he never known about the young lady , that he never <unk> about it , that he never went fur to hurt her , that he would sooner have hurt his own self , that he ’ d sooner have had his unfortnet <unk> <unk> off than ever gone <unk> her , and that she wos wery good to him , she wos .
<unk> himself throughout as if in his poor fashion he really meant it , and winding up with some very miserable <unk> .
Allan Woodcourt sees that this is not a <unk> .
He <unk> himself to touch him .
“ Come , Jo .
Tell me . ” “ No .
I <unk> ’ t , ” says Jo , relapsing into the <unk> state .
“ I <unk> ’ t , or I would . ” “ But I must know , ” returns the other , “ all the same .
Come , Jo . ” After two or three such <unk> , Jo lifts up his head again , looks round the court again , and says in a low voice , “ Well , I ’ ll tell you something .
I was took away .
There ! ” “ Took away ?
In the night ? ” “ Ah ! ” Very apprehensive of being overheard , Jo looks about him and even glances up some ten feet at the top of the hoarding and through the <unk> in it lest the object of his distrust should be looking over or hidden on the other side .
“ Who took you away ? ” “ I <unk> ’ t name him , ” says Jo .
“ I <unk> ’ t do it , sir .
“ But I want , in the young lady ’ s name , to know .
You may trust me .
No one else shall hear . ” “ Ah , but I don ’ t know , ” replies Jo , shaking his head fearfully , “ as he DON ’ T hear . ” “ Why , he is not in this place . ” “ Oh , ain ’ t he though ? ” says Jo .
“ He ’ s in all manner of places , all at <unk> . ” Allan looks at him in perplexity , but <unk> some real meaning and good faith at the bottom of this <unk> reply .
He patiently <unk> an <unk> answer ; and Jo , more <unk> by his patience than by anything else , at last <unk> whispers a name in his ear .
“ Aye ! ” says Allan .
“ Why , what had you been doing ? ” “ <unk> , sir .
Never done nothink to get myself into no trouble , ’ <unk> in not moving on and the inkwhich .
But I ’ m a-moving on now .
I ’ m a-moving on to the berryin ground — that ’ s the move as I ’ m up to . ” “ No , no , we will try to prevent that .
But what did he do with you ? ” “ Put me in a <unk> , ” replied Jo , whispering , “ till I was discharged , then giv me a little money — four <unk> , wot you may call <unk> — and ses ‘ <unk> it !
Nobody wants you here , ’ he ses .
‘ You hook it .
You go and <unk> , ’ he ses .
‘ You move on , ’ he ses .
‘ Don ’ t let me ever see you <unk> within forty mile of London , or you ’ ll <unk> it . ’ So I shall , if ever he <unk> see me , and he ’ ll see me if I ’ m above ground , ” concludes Jo , <unk> repeating all his former precautions and <unk> .
Allan considers a little , then remarks , turning to the woman but keeping an encouraging eye on Jo , “ He is not so ungrateful as you supposed .
He had a reason for going away , though it was an <unk> one . ” “ Thankee , sir , <unk> ! ” exclaims Jo .
“ There now !
See how hard you wos upon me .
But <unk> you tell the young lady wot the <unk> ses , and it ’ s all right .
For YOU wos wery good to me too , and I knows it . ” “ Now , Jo , ” says Allan , keeping his eye upon him , “ come with me and I will find you a better place than this to lie down and hide in .
If I take one side of the way and you the other to avoid observation , you will not run away , I know very well , if you make me a promise . ” “ I won ’ t , not unless I wos to see HIM <unk> , sir . ” “ Very well .
I take your word .
<unk> the town is getting up by this time , and the whole town will be broad awake in another hour .
Come along .
Good day again , my good woman . ” “ Good day again , sir , and I thank you kindly many times again . ” She has been sitting on her bag , deeply attentive , and now rises and takes it up .
Jo , repeating , “ <unk> you tell the young lady as I never went fur to hurt her and wot the <unk> ses ! ” nods and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> , and half laughs and half cries , a farewell to her , and takes his creeping way along after Allan Woodcourt , close to the houses on the opposite side of the street .
In this order , the two come up out of Tom-all-Alone ’ s into the broad <unk> of the sunlight and the <unk> air .
CHAPTER <unk> Jo ’ s Will As Allan Woodcourt and Jo proceed along the streets where the high church <unk> and the <unk> are so near and clear in the morning light that the city itself seems renewed by rest , Allan <unk> in his mind how and where he shall bestow his companion .
“ It surely is a strange fact , ” he considers , “ that in the heart of a <unk> world this creature in human form should be more difficult to dispose of than an <unk> dog . ” But it is none the less a fact because of its <unk> , and the difficulty remains .
At first he looks behind him often to assure himself that Jo is still really following .
But look where he will , he still beholds him close to the opposite houses , making his way with his <unk> hand from brick to brick and from door to door , and often , as he <unk> along , glancing over at him <unk> .
<unk> satisfied that the last thing in his thoughts is to give him the slip , Allan goes on , considering with a less divided attention what he shall do .
A <unk> at a <unk> suggests the first thing to be done .
He stops there , looks round , and beckons Jo .
Jo crosses and comes <unk> and shuffling up , slowly <unk> the knuckles of his right hand round and round in the <unk> palm of his left , <unk> dirt with a natural <unk> and mortar .
What is a <unk> <unk> to Jo is then set before him , and he begins to <unk> the coffee and to <unk> the bread and butter , looking anxiously about him in all directions as he <unk> and drinks , like a <unk> animal .
But he is so sick and miserable that even <unk> has abandoned him .
“ I thought I was <unk> <unk> , sir , ” says Jo , soon putting down his food , “ but I don ’ t know nothink — not even that .
I don ’ t care for eating <unk> nor yet for drinking on ’ em . ” And Jo stands shivering and looking at the breakfast <unk> .
Allan Woodcourt lays his hand upon his <unk> and on his chest .
“ Draw breath , Jo ! ” “ It draws , ” says Jo , “ as heavy as a cart . ” He might add , “ And rattles like it , ” but he only mutters , “ I ’ m a-moving on , sir . ” Allan looks about for an <unk> ’ s shop .
There is none at hand , but a <unk> does as well or better .
He <unk> a little measure of wine and gives the lad a portion of it very carefully .
He begins to <unk> almost as soon as it passes his lips .
“ We may repeat that <unk> , Jo , ” observes Allan after watching him with his attentive face .
“ So !
Now we will take five minutes ’ rest , and then go on again . ” Leaving the boy sitting on the bench of the <unk> , with his back against an iron <unk> , Allan Woodcourt paces up and down in the early sunshine , casting an occasional look towards him without appearing to watch him .
It requires no <unk> to perceive that he is warmed and refreshed .
If a face so shaded can brighten , his face <unk> somewhat ; and by little and little he <unk> the <unk> of bread he had so <unk> laid down .
<unk> of these signs of <unk> , Allan engages him in conversation and <unk> to his no small wonder the <unk> of the lady in the veil , with all its consequences .
Jo slowly <unk> as he slowly tells it .
When he has finished his story and his bread , they go on again .
<unk> to refer his difficulty in finding a temporary place of refuge for the boy to his old patient , zealous little Miss Flite , Allan leads the way to the court where he and Jo first <unk> .
But all is changed at the rag and bottle shop ; Miss Flite no longer lodges there ; it is shut up ; and a <unk> female , much <unk> by dust , whose age is a <unk> , but who is indeed no other than the interesting Judy , is <unk> and spare in her replies .
These <unk> , however , to inform the visitor that Miss Flite and her birds are <unk> with a Mrs. Blinder , in Bell Yard , he repairs to that neighbouring place , where Miss Flite ( who rises early that she may be punctual at the <unk> of justice held by her excellent friend the Chancellor ) comes running downstairs with tears of welcome and with open arms .
“ My dear physician ! ” cries Miss Flite .
“ My <unk> , distinguished , honourable officer ! ” She uses some odd expressions , but is as cordial and full of heart as <unk> itself can be — more so than it often is .
Allan , very patient with her , <unk> until she has no more <unk> to express , then points out Jo , trembling in a doorway , and tells her how he comes there .
“ Where can I lodge him <unk> for the present ?
Now , you have a <unk> of knowledge and good sense and can advise me . ” Miss Flite , mighty proud of the compliment , sets herself to consider ; but it is long before a bright thought <unk> to her .
Mrs. Blinder is entirely let , and she herself <unk> poor Gridley ’ s room .
“ Gridley ! ” exclaims Miss Flite , clapping her hands after a <unk> <unk> of this remark .
“ Gridley !
To be sure !
Of course !
My dear physician !
General George will help us out . ” It is hopeless to ask for any information about General George , and would be , though Miss Flite had not already run upstairs to put on her pinched bonnet and her poor little shawl and to arm herself with her reticule of documents .
But as she informs her physician in her <unk> manner on coming down in full array that General George , whom she often calls upon , knows her dear Fitz Jarndyce and takes a great interest in all connected with her , Allan is induced to think that they may be in the right way .
So he tells Jo , for his encouragement , that this walking about will soon be over now ; and they repair to the general ’ s .
<unk> it is not far .
From the <unk> of George ’ s Shooting Gallery , and the long entry , and the bare perspective beyond it , Allan Woodcourt <unk> well .
He also <unk> promise in the figure of Mr. George himself , <unk> towards them in his morning exercise with his pipe in his mouth , no stock on , and his <unk> arms , developed by broadsword and <unk> , <unk> <unk> themselves through his light <unk> .
“ Your servant , sir , ” says Mr. George with a military salute .
<unk> smiling all over his broad forehead up into his <unk> hair , he then <unk> to Miss Flite , as , with great <unk> , and at some length , she <unk> the courtly ceremony of <unk> .
He winds it up with another “ Your servant , sir ! ” and another salute .
“ Excuse me , sir .
A sailor , I believe ? ” says Mr. George .
“ I am proud to find I have the air of one , ” returns Allan ; “ but I am only a <unk> doctor . ” “ Indeed , sir !
I should have thought you was a regular <unk> myself . ” Allan hopes Mr. George will forgive his <unk> the more readily on that account , and particularly that he will not lay aside his pipe , which , in his politeness , he has <unk> some intention of doing .
“ You are very good , sir , ” returns the trooper .
“ As I know by experience that it ’ s not disagreeable to Miss Flite , and since it ’ s equally agreeable to yourself — ” and <unk> the sentence by putting it between his lips again .
Allan proceeds to tell him all he knows about Jo , unto which the trooper listens with a grave face .
“ And that ’ s the lad , sir , is it ? ” he inquires , looking along the entry to where Jo stands staring up at the great letters on the whitewashed front , which have no meaning in his eyes .
“ That ’ s he , ” says Allan .
“ And , Mr. George , I am in this difficulty about him .
I am unwilling to place him in a hospital , even if I could <unk> him immediate admission , because I <unk> that he would not stay there many hours if he could be so much as got there .
The same objection <unk> to a <unk> , supposing I had the patience to be <unk> and <unk> , and handed about from post to pillar in trying to get him into one , which is a system that I don ’ t take kindly to . ” “ No man does , sir , ” returns Mr. George .
“ I am convinced that he would not remain in either place , because he is possessed by an extraordinary terror of this person who <unk> him to keep out of the way ; in his ignorance , he believes this person to be everywhere , and <unk> of everything . ” “ I ask your pardon , sir , ” says Mr. George .
“ But you have not mentioned that party ’ s name .
Is it a secret , sir ? ” “ The boy makes it one .
But his name is Bucket . ” “ Bucket the <unk> , sir ? ” “ The same man . ” “ The man is known to me , sir , ” returns the trooper after blowing out a cloud of smoke and <unk> his chest , “ and the boy is so far correct that he undoubtedly is a — <unk> customer . ” Mr. George smokes with a profound meaning after this and <unk> Miss Flite in silence .
“ Now , I wish Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson at least to know that this Jo , who tells so strange a story , has <unk> , and to have it in their power to speak with him if they should desire to do so .
Therefore I want to get him , for the present moment , into any poor lodging kept by decent people where he would be admitted .
<unk> people and Jo , Mr. George , ” says Allan , following the direction of the trooper ’ s eyes along the entry , “ have not been much acquainted , as you see .
Hence the difficulty .
Do you happen to know any one in this neighbourhood who would receive him for a while on my paying for him beforehand ? ” As he puts the question , he becomes aware of a <unk> little man standing at the trooper ’ s elbow and looking up , with an <unk> twisted figure and countenance , into the trooper ’ s face .
After a few more <unk> at his pipe , the trooper looks down <unk> at the little man , and the little man winks up at the trooper .
“ Well , sir , ” says Mr. George , “ I can assure you that I would willingly be knocked on the head at any time if it would be at all agreeable to Miss Summerson , and consequently I esteem it a privilege to do that young lady any service , however small .
We are naturally in the vagabond way here , sir , both myself and Phil .
You see what the place is .
You are welcome to a quiet corner of it for the boy if the same would meet your views .
No charge made , except for <unk> .
We are not in a <unk> state of circumstances here , sir .
We are liable to be tumbled out neck and <unk> at a moment ’ s notice .
However , sir , such as the place is , and so long as it <unk> , here it is at your service . ” With a <unk> wave of his pipe , Mr. George places the whole building at his visitor ’ s disposal .
“ I take it for granted , sir , ” he adds , “ you being one of the medical staff , that there is no present <unk> about this unfortunate subject ? ” Allan is quite sure of it .
“ Because , sir , ” says Mr. George , shaking his head <unk> , “ we have had enough of that . ” His tone is no less <unk> echoed by his new acquaintance .
“ Still I am bound to tell you , ” observes Allan after repeating his former assurance , “ that the boy is <unk> low and <unk> and that he may be — I do not say that he is — too far gone to recover . ” “ Do you consider him in present danger , sir ? ” inquires the trooper .
“ Yes , I fear so . ” “ Then , sir , ” returns the trooper in a <unk> manner , “ it appears to me — being naturally in the vagabond way myself — that the sooner he comes out of the street , the better .
You , Phil !
Bring him in ! ” Mr. Squod <unk> out , all on one side , to execute the word of command ; and the trooper , having smoked his pipe , lays it by .
Jo is brought in .
He is not one of Mrs. Pardiggle ’ s <unk> Indians ; he is not one of Mrs. Jellyby ’ s <unk> , being wholly <unk> with Borrioboola-Gha ; he is not softened by distance and <unk> ; he is not a genuine <unk> <unk> ; he is the ordinary <unk> article .
<unk> , ugly , disagreeable to all the senses , in body a common creature of the common streets , only in soul a heathen .
<unk> <unk> <unk> him , homely <unk> <unk> him , homely <unk> are in him , homely rags are on him ; native ignorance , the growth of English <unk> and <unk> , <unk> his <unk> nature lower than the <unk> that <unk> .
<unk> forth , Jo , in <unk> colours !
From the sole of thy foot to the crown of thy head , there is nothing interesting about thee .
He <unk> slowly into Mr. George ’ s gallery and stands <unk> together in a bundle , looking all about the floor .
He seems to know that they have an inclination to <unk> from him , partly for what he is and partly for what he has caused .
He , too , <unk> from them .
He is not of the same order of things , not of the same place in <unk> .
He is of no order and no place , neither of the <unk> nor of humanity .
“ Look here , Jo ! ” says Allan .
“ This is Mr. George . ” Jo <unk> the floor for some time longer , then looks up for a moment , and then down again .
“ He is a kind friend to you , for he is going to give you lodging room here . ” Jo makes a <unk> with one hand , which is supposed to be a bow .
After a little more consideration and some <unk> and changing of the foot on which he rests , he mutters that he is “ wery thankful . ” “ You are quite safe here .
All you have to do at present is to be <unk> and to get strong .
And mind you tell us the truth here , whatever you do , Jo . ” “ <unk> if I don ’ t , sir , ” says Jo , <unk> to his favourite declaration .
“ I never done nothink <unk> , but wot you knows on , to get myself into no trouble .
I never was in no other trouble at all , sir , ’ <unk> not <unk> ’ nothink and <unk> . ” “ I believe it , now attend to Mr. George .
I see he is going to speak to you . ” “ My intention merely was , sir , ” observes Mr. George , <unk> broad and upright , “ to point out to him where he can lie down and get a <unk> good <unk> of sleep .
Now , look here . ” As the trooper speaks , he <unk> them to the other end of the gallery and opens one of the little <unk> .
“ There you are , you see !
Here is a <unk> , and here you may rest , on good behaviour , as long as Mr. , I ask your pardon , sir ” — he refers <unk> to the card Allan has given him — “ Mr.
Woodcourt <unk> .
Don ’ t you be alarmed if you hear <unk> ; they ’ ll be <unk> at the <unk> , and not you .
Now , there ’ s another thing I would recommend , sir , ” says the trooper , turning to his visitor .
“ Phil , come here ! ” Phil bears down upon them according to his usual <unk> .
“ Here is a man , sir , who was found , when a baby , in the <unk> .
Consequently , it is to be expected that he takes a natural interest in this poor creature .
You do , don ’ t you , Phil ? ” “ Certainly and surely I do , guv ’ ner , ” is Phil ’ s reply .
“ Now I was thinking , sir , ” says Mr. George in a martial sort of confidence , as if he were giving his opinion in a <unk> of <unk> at a <unk> , “ that if this man was to take him to a <unk> and was to lay out a few shillings in getting him one or two coarse articles — ” “ Mr.
George , my considerate friend , ” returns Allan , taking out his purse , “ it is the very favour I would have asked . ” Phil Squod and Jo are sent out immediately on this work of <unk> .
Miss Flite , quite <unk> by her success , makes the best of her way to court , having great fears that otherwise her friend the Chancellor may be uneasy about her or may give the judgment she has so long expected in her absence , and observing “ which you know , my dear physician , and general , after so many years , would be too <unk> unfortunate ! ” Allan takes the opportunity of going out to <unk> some <unk> <unk> , and obtaining them near at hand , soon returns to find the trooper walking up and down the gallery , and to fall into step and walk with him .
“ I take it , sir , ” says Mr. George , “ that you know Miss Summerson pretty well ? ” Yes , it appears .
“ Not related to her , sir ? ” No , it appears .
“ Excuse the <unk> curiosity , ” says Mr. George .
“ It seemed to me probable that you might take more than a common interest in this poor creature because Miss Summerson had taken that unfortunate interest in him .
’ Tis MY case , sir , I assure you . ” “ And mine , Mr. George . ” The trooper looks sideways at Allan ’ s sunburnt cheek and bright dark eye , rapidly <unk> his height and <unk> , and seems to approve of him .
“ Since you have been out , sir , I have been thinking that I unquestionably know the rooms in Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields , where Bucket took the lad , according to his account .
Though he is not acquainted with the name , I can help you to it .
It ’ s Tulkinghorn .
That ’ s what it is . ” Allan looks at him inquiringly , repeating the name .
“ Tulkinghorn .
That ’ s the name , sir .
I know the man , and know him to have been in communication with Bucket before , respecting a deceased person who had given him offence .
I know the man , sir .
To my sorrow . ” Allan naturally asks what kind of man he is .
“ What kind of man !
Do you mean to look at ? ” “ I think I know that much of him .
I mean to deal with .
<unk> , what kind of man ? ” “ Why , then I ’ ll tell you , sir , ” returns the trooper , stopping short and folding his arms on his square chest so angrily that his face fires and <unk> all over ; “ he is a <unk> bad kind of man .
He is a <unk> kind of man .
He is no more like flesh and blood than a rusty old <unk> is .
He is a kind of man — by George ! — that has caused me more <unk> , and more uneasiness , and more <unk> with myself than all other men put together .
That ’ s the kind of man Mr. Tulkinghorn is ! ” “ I am sorry , ” says Allan , “ to have touched so <unk> a place . ” “ <unk> ? ” The trooper plants his legs <unk> apart , <unk> the palm of his broad right hand , and lays it on the imaginary <unk> .
“ It ’ s no fault of yours , sir ; but you shall judge .
He has got a power over me .
He is the man I spoke of just now as being able to <unk> me out of this place neck and <unk> .
He keeps me on a constant <unk> .
He won ’ t hold off , and he won ’ t come on .
If I have a <unk> to make him , or time to ask him for , or anything to go to him about , he don ’ t see me , don ’ t hear me — passes me on to <unk> ’ s in <unk> ’ s Inn , <unk> ’ s in <unk> ’ s Inn passes me back again to him — he keeps me <unk> and <unk> about him as if I was made of the same stone as himself .
Why , I spend half my life now , pretty well , <unk> and <unk> about his door .
What does he care ?
Nothing .
Just as much as the rusty old <unk> I have <unk> him to .
He <unk> and <unk> me till — <unk> !
<unk> !
I am <unk> myself .
Mr. Woodcourt , ” the trooper resumes his march , “ all I say is , he is an old man ; but I am glad I shall never have the chance of setting <unk> to my horse and riding at him in a fair field .
For if I had that chance , in one of the <unk> he drives me into — he ’ d go down , sir ! ” Mr. George has been so excited that he finds it necessary to <unk> his forehead on his <unk> .
Even while he whistles his <unk> away with the national <unk> , some <unk> <unk> of his head and <unk> of his chest still linger behind , not to mention an occasional hasty <unk> with both hands of his open <unk> , as if it were scarcely open enough to prevent his being troubled by a choking sensation .
In short , Allan Woodcourt has not much doubt about the going down of Mr. Tulkinghorn on the field referred to .
Jo and his <unk> presently return , and Jo is assisted to his <unk> by the careful Phil , to whom , after due administration of medicine by his own hands , Allan <unk> all <unk> means and instructions .
The morning is by this time getting on <unk> .
He repairs to his lodgings to dress and breakfast , and then , without seeking rest , goes away to Mr. Jarndyce to communicate his discovery .
With him Mr. Jarndyce returns alone , confidentially telling him that there are reasons for keeping this matter very quiet indeed and showing a serious interest in it .
To Mr. Jarndyce , Jo repeats in substance what he said in the morning , without any material <unk> .
Only that cart of his is <unk> to draw , and draws with a <unk> sound .
“ Let me lay here quiet and not be <unk> no more , ” falters Jo , “ and be so kind any person as is <unk> <unk> where I used fur to sleep , as <unk> to say to Mr. Sangsby that Jo , wot he known once , is a-moving on right <unk> with his duty , and I ’ ll be wery thankful .
I ’ d be more thankful than I am <unk> if it wos any ways possible for an unfortnet to be it . ” He makes so many of these references to the law-stationer in the course of a day or two that Allan , after <unk> with Mr. Jarndyce , <unk> <unk> to call in Cook ’ s Court , the rather , as the cart seems to be breaking down .
To Cook ’ s Court , therefore , he repairs .
Mr. Snagsby is behind his counter in his grey coat and sleeves , <unk> an <unk> of several <unk> which has just come in from the <unk> ’ s , an immense desert of <unk> and parchment , with here and there a <unk> of a few large letters to break the awful <unk> and save the <unk> from despair .
Mr Snagsby puts up at one of these inky <unk> and <unk> the stranger with his cough of general preparation for business .
“ You don ’ t remember me , Mr. Snagsby ? ” The stationer ’ s heart begins to <unk> heavily , for his old <unk> have never <unk> .
It is as much as he can do to answer , “ No , sir , I can ’ t say I do .
I should have considered — not to put too fine a point upon it — that I never saw you before , sir . ” “ <unk> before , ” says Allan Woodcourt .
“ Once at a poor bedside , and once — ” “ It ’ s come at last ! ” thinks the afflicted stationer , as recollection breaks upon him .
“ It ’ s got to a head now and is going to burst ! ” But he has sufficient presence of mind to conduct his visitor into the little <unk> and to shut the door .
“ Are you a married man , sir ? ” “ No , I am not . ” “ Would you make the attempt , though single , ” says Mr. Snagsby in a melancholy whisper , “ to speak as low as you can ?
For my little woman is <unk> somewheres , or I ’ ll <unk> the business and five hundred pound ! ” In deep <unk> Mr. Snagsby sits down on his stool , with his back against his desk , protesting , “ I never had a secret of my own , sir .
I can ’ t charge my memory with ever having once <unk> to deceive my little woman on my own account since she named the day .
I wouldn ’ t have done it , sir .
Not to put too fine a point upon it , I couldn ’ t have done it , I <unk> ’ t have done it .
Whereas , and <unk> , I find myself wrapped round with secrecy and mystery , till my life is a burden to me . ” His visitor <unk> his regret to hear it and asks him does he remember Jo .
Mr. Snagsby answers with a suppressed groan , oh , don ’ t he !
“ You couldn ’ t name an individual human being — except myself — that my little woman is more set and determined against than Jo , ” says Mr. Snagsby .
Allan asks why .
“ Why ? ” repeats Mr. Snagsby , in his <unk> <unk> at the <unk> of hair at the back of his bald head .
“ How should I know why ?
But you are a single person , sir , and may you long be spared to ask a married person such a question ! ” With this <unk> wish , Mr. Snagsby coughs a cough of dismal resignation and <unk> himself to hear what the visitor has to communicate .
“ There again ! ” says Mr. Snagsby , who , between the earnestness of his feelings and the suppressed tones of his voice is discoloured in the face .
“ At it again , in a new direction !
A certain person charges me , in the <unk> way , not to talk of Jo to any one , even my little woman .
Then comes another certain person , in the person of yourself , and charges me , in an equally solemn way , not to mention Jo to that other certain person above all other persons .
Why , this is a private <unk> !
Why , not to put too fine a point upon it , this is <unk> , sir ! ” says Mr. Snagsby .
But it is better than he expected after all , being no <unk> of the mine below him or <unk> of the pit into which he has fallen .
And being <unk> and affected by the account he hears of Jo ’ s condition , he readily engages to “ look round ” as early in the evening as he can manage it quietly .
He looks round very quietly when the evening comes , but it may turn out that Mrs. Snagsby is as quiet a <unk> as he .
Jo is very glad to see his old friend and says , when they are left alone , that he takes it uncommon kind as Mr. Sangsby should come so far out of his way on accounts of <unk> as him .
Mr. Snagsby , touched by the spectacle before him , immediately lays upon the table half a crown , that <unk> <unk> of his for all kinds of <unk> .
“ And how do you find yourself , my poor lad ? ” inquires the stationer with his cough of sympathy .
“ I am in luck , Mr. Sangsby , I am , ” returns Jo , “ and don ’ t want for nothink .
I ’ m more <unk> nor you can ’ t think .
Mr. Sangsby !
I ’ m wery sorry that I done it , but I didn ’ t go fur to do it , sir . ” The stationer softly lays down another half-crown and asks him what it is that he is sorry for having done .
“ Mr.
Sangsby , ” says Jo , “ I went and giv a illness to the lady as wos and <unk> as warn ’ t the t ’ other lady , and none of ’ em never says nothink to me for having done it , on accounts of their being <unk> good and my having been s ’ unfortnet .
The lady come herself and see me <unk> , and she ses , ‘ Ah , Jo ! ’ she ses .
‘ We thought we ’ d lost you , Jo ! ’ she ses .
And she sits down <unk> so quiet , and don ’ t pass a word nor <unk> a look upon me for having done it , she don ’ t , and I turns <unk> the wall , I <unk> , Mr. Sangsby .
And Mr. <unk> , I see him <unk> to turn away his own self .
And Mr. <unk> , he come fur to giv me <unk> fur to ease me , wot he ’ s allus <unk> ’ on day and night , and <unk> he come <unk> over me and <unk> up so bold , I see his tears <unk> , Mr. Sangsby . ” The softened stationer deposits another half-crown on the table .
Nothing less than a <unk> of that <unk> remedy will <unk> his feelings .
“ <unk> I was <unk> on , Mr. Sangsby , ” proceeds Jo , “ wos , as you wos able to write wery large , <unk> ’ raps ? ” “ Yes , Jo , please God , ” returns the stationer .
“ <unk> precious large , <unk> ’ raps ? ” says Jo with <unk> .
“ Yes , my poor boy . ” Jo laughs with pleasure .
“ <unk> I wos <unk> on then , Mr. Sangsby , wos , that when I wos moved on as fur as ever I could go and couldn ’ t be moved no <unk> , whether you might be so good <unk> ’ raps as to write out , wery large so that any one could see it <unk> , as that I wos wery truly hearty sorry that I done it and that I never went fur to do it , and that though I didn ’ t know nothink at all , I <unk> as Mr. <unk> once cried over it and wos allus grieved over it , and that I hoped as he ’ d be able to forgive me in his mind .
If the <unk> could be made to say it wery large , he might . ” “ It shall say it , Jo .
Very large . ” Jo laughs again .
“ Thankee , Mr. Sangsby .
It ’ s wery kind of you , sir , and it makes me more <unk> nor I was afore . ” The meek little stationer , with a broken and unfinished cough , <unk> down his <unk> half-crown — he has never been so close to a case <unk> so many — and is <unk> to depart .
And Jo and he , upon this little earth , shall meet no more .
No more .
For the cart so hard to draw is near its journey ’ s end and <unk> over <unk> ground .
All round the clock it labours up the broken steps , shattered and worn .
Not many times can the sun rise and behold it still upon its weary road .
Phil Squod , with his <unk> gunpowder <unk> , at once <unk> as nurse and works as <unk> at his little table in a corner , often looking round and saying with a nod of his <unk> cap and an encouraging <unk> of his one eyebrow , “ Hold up , my boy !
Hold up ! ” There , too , is Mr. Jarndyce many a time , and Allan Woodcourt almost always , both thinking , much , how strangely fate has <unk> this rough <unk> in the <unk> of very different lives .
There , too , the trooper is a frequent visitor , filling the doorway with his <unk> figure and , from his <unk> of life and strength , seeming to shed down temporary <unk> upon Jo , who never <unk> to speak more <unk> in answer to his cheerful words .
Jo is in a sleep or in a <unk> to-day , and Allan Woodcourt , newly arrived , stands by him , looking down upon his <unk> form .
After a while he softly seats himself upon the bedside with his face towards him — just as he sat in the law-writer ’ s room — and touches his chest and heart .
The cart had very nearly given up , but labours on a little more .
The trooper stands in the doorway , still and silent .
Phil has stopped in a low <unk> noise , with his little hammer in his hand .
Mr. Woodcourt looks round with that grave professional interest and attention on his face , and glancing <unk> at the trooper , signs to Phil to carry his table out .
When the little hammer is next used , there will be a speck of <unk> upon it .
“ Well , Jo !
What is the matter ?
Don ’ t be frightened . ” “ I thought , ” says Jo , who has started and is looking round , “ I thought I was in Tom-all-Alone ’ s <unk> .
Ain ’ t there nobody here but you , Mr. <unk> ? ” “ Nobody . ” “ And I ain ’ t took back to Tom-all-Alone ’ s .
Am I , sir ? ” “ No . ” Jo closes his eyes , muttering , “ I ’ m wery thankful . ” After watching him closely a little while , Allan puts his mouth very near his ear and says to him in a low , <unk> voice , “ Jo !
Did you ever know a prayer ? ” “ Never <unk> nothink , sir . ” “ Not so much as one short prayer ? ” “ No , sir .
<unk> at all .
Mr. Chadbands he wos <unk> <unk> at Mr. Sangsby ’ s and I heerd him , but he sounded as if he wos <unk> ’ to <unk> , and not to me .
He prayed a lot , but I couldn ’ t make out nothink on it .
<unk> times there was other <unk> come down Tom-all-Alone ’ s <unk> , but they all <unk> <unk> as the t ’ other ’ <unk> prayed wrong , and all <unk> sounded to be <unk> to <unk> , or <unk> blame on the t ’ others , and not <unk> to us .
<unk> never <unk> nothink .
I never <unk> what it wos all about . ” It takes him a long time to say this , and few but an experienced and attentive <unk> could hear , or , hearing , understand him .
After a short <unk> into sleep or <unk> , he makes , of a sudden , a strong effort to get out of bed .
“ <unk> , Jo !
What now ? ” “ It ’ s time for me to go to that there berryin ground , sir , ” he returns with a wild look .
“ Lie down , and tell me .
What burying ground , Jo ? ” “ Where they laid him as wos wery good to me , wery good to me indeed , he wos .
It ’ s time fur me to go down to that there berryin ground , sir , and ask to be put along with him .
I wants to go there and be <unk> .
He used fur to say to me , ‘ I am as poor as you to-day , Jo , ’ he ses .
I wants to tell him that I am as poor as him now and have come there to be laid along with him . ” “ By and by , Jo .
By and by . ” “ Ah !
<unk> ’ raps they wouldn ’ t do it if I wos to go myself .
But will you promise to have me took there , sir , and laid along with him ? ” “ I will , indeed . ” “ Thankee , sir .
Thankee , sir .
They ’ ll have to get the key of the gate afore they can take me in , for it ’ s allus locked .
And there ’ s a step there , as I used for to clean with my broom .
It ’ s turned wery dark , sir .
Is there any light <unk> ? ” “ It is coming fast , Jo . ” <unk> .
The cart is shaken all to pieces , and the <unk> road is very near its end .
“ Jo , my poor fellow ! ” “ I hear you , sir , in the dark , but I ’ m <unk> — <unk> — let me catch hold of your hand . ” “ Jo , can you say what I say ? ” “ I ’ ll say <unk> as you say , sir , for I knows it ’ s good . ” “ Our Father . ” “ Our Father !
Yes , that ’ s wery good , sir . ” “ Which art in heaven . ” “ <unk> in heaven — is the light <unk> , sir ? ” “ It is close at hand .
<unk> be thy name ! ” “ <unk> be — thy — ” The light is come upon the dark <unk> way .
Dead !
Dead , your <unk> .
Dead , my <unk> and gentlemen .
Dead , right <unk> and wrong <unk> of every order .
Dead , men and women , born with <unk> compassion in your hearts .
And dying thus around us every day .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> In The place in Lincolnshire has shut its many eyes again , and the house in town is awake .
In Lincolnshire the Dedlocks of the past <unk> in their <unk> , and the low wind murmurs through the long drawing-room as if they were breathing pretty regularly .
In town the Dedlocks of the present rattle in their <unk> carriages through the darkness of the night , and the Dedlock Mercuries , with ashes ( or <unk> ) on their heads , <unk> of their great humility , <unk> away the drowsy <unk> in the little windows of the hall .
The fashionable world — tremendous <unk> , nearly five miles round — is in full <unk> , and the <unk> system works respectfully at its appointed <unk> .
Where the <unk> is <unk> , where the lights are brightest , where all the senses are <unk> to with the greatest delicacy and <unk> , Lady Dedlock is .
From the shining heights she has <unk> and taken , she is never absent .
Though the belief she of old <unk> in herself as one able to reserve whatsoever she would under her <unk> of pride is beaten down , though she has no assurance that what she is to those around her she will remain another day , it is not in her nature when <unk> eyes are looking on to yield or to <unk> .
They say of her that she has lately grown more handsome and more haughty .
The debilitated cousin says of her that she ’ s beauty <unk> — <unk> <unk> — but rather <unk> kind — <unk> — inconvenient woman — who WILL <unk> — <unk> .
Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing , looks nothing .
Now , as <unk> , he is to be found in <unk> of rooms , with his limp white cravat <unk> twisted into its old-fashioned tie , receiving patronage from the peerage and making no sign .
Of all men he is still the last who might be supposed to have any influence upon my Lady .
Of all women she is still the last who might be supposed to have any dread of him .
One thing has been much on her mind since their late interview in his <unk> at Chesney Wold .
She is now decided , and prepared to throw it off .
It is morning in the great world , afternoon according to the little sun .
The Mercuries , exhausted by looking out of window , are <unk> in the hall and hang their heavy heads , the <unk> creatures , like <unk> <unk> .
Like them , too , they seem to run to a deal of <unk> in their <unk> and <unk> .
Sir Leicester , in the library , has fallen asleep for the good of the country over the report of a <unk> <unk> .
My Lady sits in the room in which she gave audience to the young man of the name of Guppy .
Rosa is with her and has been writing for her and reading to her .
Rosa is now at work upon <unk> or some such pretty thing , and as she bends her head over it , my Lady watches her in silence .
Not for the first time to-day .
“ Rosa . ” The pretty village face looks brightly up .
Then , seeing how serious my Lady is , looks <unk> and surprised .
“ See to the door .
Is it shut ? ” Yes .
She goes to it and returns , and looks yet more surprised .
“ I am about to place confidence in you , child , for I know I may trust your attachment , if not your judgment .
In what I am going to do , I will not <unk> myself to you at least .
But I confide in you .
Say nothing to any one of what passes between us . ” The timid little beauty <unk> in all earnestness to be <unk> .
“ Do you know , ” Lady Dedlock asks her , <unk> to her to bring her chair nearer , “ do you know , Rosa , that I am different to you from what I am to any one ? ” “ Yes , my Lady .
Much <unk> .
But then I often think I know you as you really are . ” “ You often think you know me as I really am ?
Poor child , poor child ! ” She says it with a kind of scorn — though not of Rosa — and sits <unk> , looking <unk> at her .
“ Do you think , Rosa , you are any relief or comfort to me ?
Do you suppose your being young and natural , and fond of me and grateful to me , makes it any pleasure to me to have you near me ? ” “ I don ’ t know , my Lady ; I can scarcely hope so .
But with all my heart , I wish it was so . ” “ It is so , little one . ” The pretty face is checked in its flush of pleasure by the dark expression on the handsome face before it .
It looks timidly for an explanation .
“ And if I were to say to-day , ‘ Go !
<unk> me ! ’ I should say what would give me great pain and <unk> , child , and what would leave me very solitary . ” “ My Lady !
Have I offended you ? ” “ In nothing .
Come here . ” Rosa bends down on the <unk> at my Lady ’ s feet .
My Lady , with that motherly touch of the famous ironmaster night , lays her hand upon her dark hair and gently keeps it there .
“ I told you , Rosa , that I wished you to be happy and that I would make you so if I could make anybody happy on this earth .
I cannot .
There are reasons now known to me , reasons in which you have no part , rendering it far better for you that you should not remain here .
You must not remain here .
I have determined that you shall not .
I have written to the father of your lover , and he will be here to-day .
All this I have done for your sake . ” The weeping girl <unk> her hand with kisses and says what shall she do , what shall she do , when they are separated !
Her mistress kisses her on the cheek and makes no other answer .
“ Now , be happy , child , under better circumstances .
Be beloved and happy ! ” “ Ah , my Lady , I have sometimes thought — forgive my being so free — that YOU are not happy . ” “ I ! ” “ Will you be more so when you have sent me away ?
Pray , pray , think again .
Let me stay a little while ! ” “ I have said , my child , that what I do , I do for your sake , not my own .
It is done .
What I am towards you , Rosa , is what I am now — not what I shall be a little while hence .
<unk> this , and keep my confidence .
Do so much for my sake , and thus all ends between us ! ” She <unk> herself from her <unk> companion and leaves the room .
<unk> in the afternoon , when she next appears upon the staircase , she is in her <unk> and <unk> state .
As indifferent as if all passion , feeling , and interest had been worn out in the earlier ages of the world and had <unk> from its surface with its other departed <unk> .
Mercury has announced Mr. Rouncewell , which is the cause of her appearance .
Mr. Rouncewell is not in the library , but she repairs to the library .
Sir Leicester is there , and she wishes to speak to him first .
“ Sir Leicester , I am desirous — but you are engaged . ” Oh , dear no !
Not at all .
Only Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Always at hand .
<unk> every place .
No relief or security from him for a moment .
“ I beg your pardon , Lady Dedlock .
Will you allow me to retire ? ” With a look that plainly says , “ You know you have the power to remain if you will , ” she tells him it is not necessary and moves towards a chair .
Mr. Tulkinghorn brings it a little forward for her with his <unk> bow and retires into a window opposite .
<unk> between her and the <unk> light of day in the now quiet street , his shadow falls upon her , and he <unk> all before her .
Even so does he <unk> her life .
It is a dull street under the best conditions , where the two long rows of houses stare at each other with that severity that half-a-dozen of its greatest <unk> seem to have been slowly <unk> into stone rather than originally built in that material .
It is a street of such dismal grandeur , so determined not to <unk> to <unk> , that the doors and windows hold a gloomy state of their own in black <unk> and dust , and the echoing <unk> behind have a dry and massive appearance , as if they were reserved to stable the stone <unk> of noble <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> itself over the <unk> of steps in this awful street , and from these <unk> <unk> , <unk> for <unk> <unk> gasp at the <unk> gas .
Here and there a weak little iron <unk> , through which bold boys <unk> to throw their friends ’ <unk> ( its only present use ) , <unk> its place among the rusty <unk> , sacred to the memory of departed oil .
<unk> , even oil itself , yet lingering at long intervals in a little absurd glass pot , with a <unk> in the bottom like an oyster , <unk> and <unk> at <unk> lights every night , like its high and dry master in the House of <unk> .
Therefore there is not much that Lady Dedlock , seated in her chair , could wish to see through the window in which Mr. Tulkinghorn stands .
And yet — and yet — she sends a look in that direction as if it were her heart ’ s desire to have that figure moved out of the way .
Sir Leicester begs his Lady ’ s pardon .
She was about to say ?
“ Only that Mr. Rouncewell is here ( he has called by my appointment ) and that we had better make an end of the question of that girl .
I am tired to death of the matter . ” “ What can I do — to — assist ? ” demands Sir Leicester in some considerable doubt .
“ Let us see him here and have done with it .
Will you tell them to send him up ? ” “ Mr.
Tulkinghorn , be so good as to ring .
Thank you .
<unk> , ” says Sir Leicester to Mercury , not immediately remembering the business term , “ request the iron gentleman to walk this way . ” Mercury departs in search of the iron gentleman , finds , and produces him .
Sir Leicester receives that <unk> person <unk> .
“ I hope you are well , Mr. Rouncewell .
Be seated .
( My solicitor , Mr.
Tulkinghorn . )
My Lady was desirous , Mr. Rouncewell , ” Sir Leicester <unk> <unk> him with a solemn wave of his hand , “ was desirous to speak with you .
Hem ! ” “ I shall be very happy , ” returns the iron gentleman , “ to give my best attention to anything Lady Dedlock does me the honour to say . ” As he turns towards her , he finds that the impression she makes upon him is less agreeable than on the former occasion .
A distant <unk> air makes a cold atmosphere about her , and there is nothing in her bearing , as there was before , to encourage <unk> .
“ Pray , sir , ” says Lady Dedlock <unk> , “ may I be allowed to inquire whether anything has passed between you and your son respecting your son ’ s fancy ? ” It is almost too troublesome to her languid eyes to bestow a look upon him as she asks this question .
“ If my memory <unk> me , Lady Dedlock , I said , when I had the pleasure of seeing you before , that I should seriously advise my son to conquer that — fancy . ” The ironmaster repeats her expression with a little emphasis .
“ And did you ? ” “ Oh !
Of course I did . ” Sir Leicester gives a nod , approving and <unk> .
Very proper .
The iron gentleman , having said that he would do it , was bound to do it .
No difference in this respect between the base <unk> and the precious .
<unk> proper .
“ And pray has he done so ? ” “ Really , Lady Dedlock , I cannot make you a <unk> reply .
I fear not .
Probably not yet .
In our condition of life , we sometimes couple an intention with our — our <unk> which <unk> them not altogether easy to throw off .
I think it is rather our way to be in earnest . ” Sir Leicester has a <unk> that there may be a hidden Wat <unk> meaning in this expression , and <unk> a little .
Mr. Rouncewell is perfectly good-humoured and polite , but within such limits , evidently <unk> his tone to his reception .
“ Because , ” proceeds my Lady , “ I have been thinking of the subject , which is tiresome to me . ” “ I am very sorry , I am sure . ” “ And also of what Sir Leicester said upon it , in which I quite <unk> ” — Sir Leicester <unk> — “ and if you cannot give us the assurance that this fancy is at an end , I have come to the conclusion that the girl had better leave me . ” “ I can give no such assurance , Lady Dedlock .
Nothing of the kind . ” “ Then she had better go . ” “ Excuse me , my Lady , ” Sir Leicester <unk> interposes , “ but perhaps this may be doing an injury to the young woman which she has not <unk> .
Here is a young woman , ” says Sir Leicester , <unk> laying out the matter with his right hand like a service of plate , “ whose good fortune it is to have attracted the notice and favour of an eminent lady and to live , under the protection of that eminent lady , surrounded by the various advantages which such a position <unk> , and which are unquestionably very great — I believe unquestionably very great , sir — for a young woman in that station of life .
The question then arises , should that young woman be <unk> of these many advantages and that good fortune simply because she has ” — Sir Leicester , with an apologetic but dignified inclination of his head towards the ironmaster , winds up his sentence — “ has attracted the notice of Mr Rouncewell ’ s son ?
Now , has she <unk> this <unk> ?
Is this just towards her ?
Is this our previous understanding ? ” “ I beg your pardon , ” interposes Mr. Rouncewell ’ s son ’ s father .
“ Sir Leicester , will you allow me ?
I think I may <unk> the subject .
Pray dismiss that from your consideration .
If you remember anything so <unk> — which is not to be expected — you would recollect that my first thought in the affair was directly <unk> to her remaining here . ” <unk> the Dedlock patronage from consideration ?
Oh !
Sir Leicester is bound to believe a pair of ears that have been handed down to him through such a family , or he really might have <unk> their report of the iron gentleman ’ s observations .
“ It is not necessary , ” observes my Lady in her <unk> manner before he can do anything but breathe <unk> , “ to enter into these matters on either side .
The girl is a very good girl ; I have nothing whatever to say against her , but she is so far insensible to her many advantages and her good fortune that she is in love — or supposes she is , poor little fool — and unable to <unk> them . ” Sir Leicester begs to observe that wholly <unk> the case .
He might have been sure that my Lady had the best grounds and reasons in support of her view .
He entirely <unk> with my Lady .
The young woman had better go .
“ As Sir Leicester observed , Mr. Rouncewell , on the last occasion when we were fatigued by this business , ” Lady Dedlock languidly proceeds , “ we cannot make conditions with you .
Without conditions , and under present circumstances , the girl is quite <unk> here and had better go .
I have told her so .
Would you wish to have her sent back to the village , or would you like to take her with you , or what would you prefer ? ” “ Lady Dedlock , if I may speak plainly — ” “ By all means . ” “ — I should prefer the course which will the <unk> <unk> you of the <unk> and remove her from her present position . ” “ And to speak as plainly , ” she returns with the same <unk> <unk> , “ so should I.
Do I understand that you will take her with you ? ” The iron gentleman makes an iron bow .
“ Sir Leicester , will you ring ? ” Mr. Tulkinghorn steps forward from his window and <unk> the bell .
“ I had forgotten you .
Thank you . ” He makes his usual bow and goes quietly back again .
Mercury , <unk> , appears , receives instructions whom to produce , <unk> away , produces the aforesaid , and departs .
Rosa has been crying and is yet in distress .
On her coming in , the ironmaster leaves his chair , takes her arm in his , and remains with her near the door ready to depart .
“ You are taken charge of , you see , ” says my Lady in her weary manner , “ and are going away well protected .
I have mentioned that you are a very good girl , and you have nothing to cry for . ” “ She seems after all , ” observes Mr. Tulkinghorn , <unk> a little forward with his hands behind him , “ as if she were crying at going away . ” “ Why , she is not <unk> , you see , ” returns Mr. Rouncewell with some quickness in his manner , as if he were glad to have the lawyer to <unk> upon , “ and she is an <unk> little thing and knows no better .
If she had remained here , sir , she would have improved , no doubt . ” “ No doubt , ” is Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s composed reply .
Rosa <unk> out that she is very sorry to leave my Lady , and that she was happy at Chesney Wold , and has been happy with my Lady , and that she thanks my Lady over and over again .
“ Out , you silly little <unk> ! ” says the ironmaster , <unk> her in a low voice , though not angrily .
“ Have a spirit , if you ’ re fond of Watt ! ” My Lady merely <unk> her off with indifference , saying , “ There , there , child !
You are a good girl .
Go away ! ” Sir Leicester has <unk> <unk> himself from the subject and retired into the sanctuary of his blue coat .
Mr. Tulkinghorn , an indistinct form against the dark street now <unk> with lamps , <unk> in my Lady ’ s view , <unk> and <unk> than before .
“ Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , ” says Mr. Rouncewell after a pause of a few moments , “ I beg to take my leave , with an apology for having again troubled you , though not of my own act , on this tiresome subject .
I can very well understand , I assure you , how tiresome so small a matter must have become to Lady Dedlock .
If I am doubtful of my dealing with it , it is only because I did not at first quietly <unk> my influence to take my young friend here away without <unk> you at all .
But it appeared to me — I dare say <unk> the importance of the thing — that it was <unk> to explain to you how the matter stood and candid to consult your wishes and <unk> .
I hope you will excuse my want of acquaintance with the polite world . ” Sir Leicester considers himself <unk> out of the sanctuary by these remarks .
“ Mr.
Rouncewell , ” he returns , “ do not mention it .
<unk> are unnecessary , I hope , on either side . ” “ I am glad to hear it , Sir Leicester ; and if I may , by way of a last word , <unk> to what I said before of my mother ’ s long connexion with the family and the worth it <unk> on both sides , I would point out this little instance here on my arm who shows herself so affectionate and faithful in parting and in whom my mother , I dare say , has done something to <unk> such feelings — though of course Lady Dedlock , by her <unk> interest and her genial condescension , has done much more . ” If he mean this <unk> , it may be <unk> than he thinks .
He points it , however , by no <unk> from his <unk> manner of speech , though in saying it he turns towards that part of the dim room where my Lady sits .
Sir Leicester stands to return his parting <unk> , Mr. Tulkinghorn again rings , Mercury takes another flight , and Mr. Rouncewell and Rosa leave the house .
Then lights are brought in , discovering Mr. Tulkinghorn still standing in his window with his hands behind him and my Lady still sitting with his figure before her , closing up her view of the night as well as of the day .
She is very pale .
Mr. Tulkinghorn , observing it as she rises to retire , thinks , “ Well she may be !
The power of this woman is astonishing .
She has been <unk> a part the whole time . ” But he can act a part too — his one <unk> character — and as he holds the door open for this woman , fifty <unk> of eyes , each fifty times <unk> than Sir Leicester ’ s pair , should find no <unk> in him .
Lady Dedlock <unk> alone in her own room to-day .
Sir Leicester is <unk> in to the <unk> of the Doodle <unk> and the <unk> of the Coodle <unk> .
Lady Dedlock asks on sitting down to dinner , still deadly pale ( and quite an <unk> of the debilitated cousin ’ s <unk> ) , whether he is gone out ?
Yes .
Whether Mr. Tulkinghorn is gone yet ?
No .
Presently she asks again , is he gone <unk> ?
No .
What is he doing ?
Mercury thinks he is writing letters in the library .
Would my Lady wish to see him ?
Anything but that .
But he wishes to see my Lady .
<unk> a few more minutes he is reported as sending his respects , and could my Lady please to receive him for a word or two after her dinner ?
My Lady will receive him now .
He comes now , <unk> for <unk> , even by her permission , while she is at table .
When they are alone , my Lady <unk> her hand to dispense with such <unk> .
“ What do you want , sir ? ” “ Why , Lady Dedlock , ” says the lawyer , taking a chair at a little distance from her and slowly rubbing his rusty legs up and down , up and down , up and down , “ I am rather surprised by the course you have taken . ” “ Indeed ? ” “ Yes , decidedly .
I was not prepared for it .
I consider it a departure from our agreement and your promise .
It puts us in a new position , Lady Dedlock .
I feel myself under the necessity of saying that I don ’ t approve of it . ” He stops in his rubbing and looks at her , with his hands on his knees .
<unk> and <unk> as he is , there is still an <unk> <unk> in his manner which is new and which does not escape this woman ’ s observation .
“ I do not quite understand you . ” “ Oh , yes you do , I think .
I think you do .
Come , come , Lady Dedlock , we must not <unk> and <unk> now .
You know you like this girl . ” “ Well , sir ? ” “ And you know — and I know — that you have not sent her away for the reasons you have <unk> , but for the purpose of <unk> her as much as possible from — excuse my mentioning it as a matter of business — any reproach and <unk> that <unk> over yourself . ” “ Well , sir ? ” “ Well , Lady Dedlock , ” returns the lawyer , crossing his legs and nursing the <unk> knee .
“ I object to that .
I consider that a dangerous proceeding .
I know it to be unnecessary and calculated to <unk> speculation , doubt , <unk> , I don ’ t know what , in the house .
Besides , it is a <unk> of our agreement .
You were to be exactly what you were before .
Whereas , it must be evident to yourself , as it is to me , that you have been this evening very different from what you were before .
Why , bless my soul , Lady Dedlock , <unk> so ! ” “ If , sir , ” she begins , “ in my knowledge of my secret — ” But he interrupts her .
“ Now , Lady Dedlock , this is a matter of business , and in a matter of business the ground cannot be kept too clear .
It is no longer your secret .
Excuse me .
That is just the mistake .
It is my secret , in trust for Sir Leicester and the family .
If it were your secret , Lady Dedlock , we should not be here holding this conversation . ” “ That is very true .
If in my knowledge of THE secret I do what I can to spare an innocent girl ( especially , remembering your own reference to her when you told my story to the assembled guests at Chesney Wold ) from the <unk> of my <unk> shame , I act upon a resolution I have taken .
Nothing in the world , and no one in the world , could shake it or could move me . ” This she says with great <unk> and distinctness and with no more outward passion than himself .
As for him , he <unk> <unk> his matter of business as if she were any insensible instrument used in business .
“ Really ?
Then you see , Lady Dedlock , ” he returns , “ you are not to be trusted .
You have put the case in a perfectly plain way , and according to the literal fact ; and that being the case , you are not to be trusted . ” “ Perhaps you may remember that I expressed some anxiety on this same point when we spoke at night at Chesney Wold ? ” “ Yes , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , coolly getting up and standing on the hearth .
“ Yes .
I recollect , Lady Dedlock , that you certainly referred to the girl , but that was before we came to our arrangement , and both the letter and the spirit of our arrangement altogether <unk> any action on your part founded upon my discovery .
There can be no doubt about that .
As to sparing the girl , of what importance or value is she ?
<unk> !
Lady Dedlock , here is a family name <unk> .
One might have supposed that the course was straight on — over everything , neither to the right nor to the left , <unk> of all considerations in the way , sparing nothing , <unk> everything under foot . ” She has been looking at the table .
She lifts up her eyes and looks at him .
There is a stern expression on her face and a part of her lower lip is <unk> under her teeth .
“ This woman <unk> me , ” Mr. Tulkinghorn thinks as she lets her glance fall again .
“ <unk> cannot be spared .
Why should she spare others ? ” For a little while they are silent .
Lady Dedlock has <unk> no dinner , but has twice or <unk> poured out water with a steady hand and drunk it .
She rises from table , takes a <unk> , and <unk> in it , shading her face .
There is nothing in her manner to express weakness or <unk> compassion .
It is thoughtful , gloomy , <unk> .
“ This woman , ” thinks Mr. Tulkinghorn , standing on the hearth , again a dark object closing up her view , “ is a study . ” He studies her at his leisure , not speaking for a time .
She too studies something at her leisure .
She is not the first to speak , appearing indeed so unlikely to be so , though he stood there until midnight , that even he is driven upon breaking silence .
“ Lady Dedlock , the most disagreeable part of this business interview remains , but it is business .
Our agreement is broken .
A lady of your sense and strength of character will be prepared for my now <unk> it void and taking my own course . ” “ I am quite prepared . ” Mr. Tulkinghorn inclines his head .
“ That is all I have to trouble you with , Lady Dedlock . ” She stops him as he is moving out of the room by asking , “ This is the notice I was to receive ?
I wish not to <unk> you . ” “ Not exactly the notice you were to receive , Lady Dedlock , because the contemplated notice supposed the agreement to have been observed .
But <unk> the same , <unk> the same .
The difference is merely in a lawyer ’ s mind . ” “ You intend to give me no other notice ? ” “ You are right .
No . ” “ Do you contemplate <unk> Sir Leicester to-night ? ” “ A home question ! ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn with a slight smile and <unk> shaking his head at the shaded face .
“ No , not to-night . ” “ <unk> ? ” “ All things considered , I had better decline answering that question , Lady Dedlock .
If I were to say I don ’ t know when , exactly , you would not believe me , and it would answer no purpose .
It may be to-morrow .
I would rather say no more .
You are prepared , and I hold out no expectations which circumstances might fail to <unk> .
I wish you good evening . ” She <unk> her hand , turns her pale face towards him as he walks silently to the door , and stops him once again as he is about to open it .
“ Do you intend to remain in the house any time ?
I heard you were writing in the library .
Are you going to return there ? ” “ Only for my hat .
I am going home . ” She bows her eyes rather than her head , the movement is so slight and curious , and he withdraws .
<unk> of the room he looks at his watch but is inclined to doubt it by a minute or <unk> .
There is a <unk> clock upon the staircase , famous , as <unk> clocks not often are , for its <unk> .
“ And what do YOU say , ” Mr. Tulkinghorn inquires , referring to it .
“ What do you say ? ” If it said now , “ Don ’ t go home ! ” What a famous clock , <unk> , if it said to-night of all the nights that it has counted off , to this old man of all the young and old men who have ever stood before it , “ Don ’ t go home ! ” With its sharp clear bell it strikes three quarters after seven and <unk> on again .
“ Why , you are worse than I thought you , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , muttering <unk> to his watch .
“ Two minutes wrong ?
At this rate you won ’ t last my time . ” What a watch to return good for evil if it <unk> in answer , “ Don ’ t go home ! ” He passes out into the streets and walks on , with his hands behind him , under the shadow of the lofty houses , many of whose mysteries , difficulties , <unk> , delicate affairs of all kinds , are <unk> up within his old black <unk> waistcoat .
He is in the confidence of the very bricks and mortar .
The high <unk> <unk> family secrets to him .
Yet there is not a voice in a mile of them to whisper , “ Don ’ t go home ! ” Through the stir and motion of the <unk> streets ; through the <unk> and <unk> of many vehicles , many feet , many voices ; with the blazing <unk> lighting him on , the west wind blowing him on , and the crowd pressing him on , he is <unk> urged upon his way , and nothing meets him <unk> , “ Don ’ t go home ! ” <unk> at last in his dull room to light his candles , and look round and up , and see the Roman pointing from the ceiling , there is no new <unk> in the Roman ’ s hand to-night or in the <unk> of the attendant groups to give him the late warning , “ Don ’ t come here ! ” It is a moonlight night , but the moon , being past the full , is only now rising over the great wilderness of London .
The stars are shining as they shone above the <unk> at Chesney Wold .
This woman , as he has of late been so accustomed to call her , looks out upon them .
Her soul is <unk> within her ; she is sick at heart and restless .
The large rooms are too <unk> and close .
She cannot <unk> their <unk> and will walk alone in a neighbouring garden .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> in all she does to be the cause of much surprise in those about her as to anything she does , this woman , <unk> muffled , goes out into the moonlight .
Mercury <unk> with the key .
Having opened the <unk> , he delivers the key into his Lady ’ s hands at her request and is bidden to go back .
She will walk there some time to ease her <unk> head .
She may be an hour , she may be more .
She <unk> no further escort .
The gate shuts upon its spring with a <unk> , and he leaves her passing on into the dark shade of some trees .
A fine night , and a bright large moon , and <unk> of stars .
Mr. Tulkinghorn , in <unk> to his cellar and in opening and shutting those <unk> doors , has to cross a little <unk> yard .
He looks up casually , thinking what a fine night , what a bright large moon , what <unk> of stars !
A quiet night , too .
A very quiet night .
When the moon shines very <unk> , a <unk> and stillness seem to proceed from her that influence even <unk> places full of life .
Not only is it a still night on dusty high roads and on <unk> , whence a wide <unk> of country may be seen in repose , quieter and quieter as it <unk> away into a <unk> of trees against the sky with the grey ghost of a bloom upon them ; not only is it a still night in <unk> and in woods , and on the river where the <unk> are fresh and green , and the stream <unk> on among pleasant <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and whispering <unk> ; not only does the stillness attend it as it <unk> where houses <unk> thick , where many bridges are reflected in it , where <unk> and <unk> make it black and awful , where it winds from these <unk> through marshes whose grim <unk> stand like <unk> washed <unk> , where it <unk> through the <unk> region of rising grounds , rich in <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and where it <unk> with the <unk> sea ; not only is it a still night on the deep , and on the shore where the <unk> stands to see the ship with her spread wings cross the path of light that appears to be presented to only him ; but even on this stranger ’ s wilderness of London there is some rest .
Its <unk> and towers and its one great <unk> grow more <unk> ; its <unk> <unk> lose their <unk> in the pale <unk> ; the <unk> that arise from the streets are <unk> and are softened , and the footsteps on the <unk> pass more <unk> away .
In these fields of Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s <unk> , where the <unk> play on Chancery pipes that have no stop , and keep their sheep in the <unk> by hook and by crook until they have <unk> them <unk> close , every noise is <unk> , this moonlight night , into a distant ringing hum , as if the city were a vast glass , <unk> .
What ’ s that ?
Who <unk> a gun or pistol ?
Where was it ?
The few <unk> start , stop , and stare about them .
Some windows and doors are opened , and people come out to look .
It was a loud report and echoed and rattled heavily .
It shook one house , or so a man says who was passing .
It has aroused all the dogs in the neighbourhood , who bark <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> across the road .
While the dogs are yet <unk> and <unk> — there is one dog <unk> like a demon — the <unk> , as if they were startled too , begin to strike .
The hum from the streets , likewise , seems to swell into a <unk> .
But it is soon over .
Before the last clock begins to strike ten , there is a <unk> .
When it has ceased , the fine night , the bright large moon , and <unk> of stars , are left at peace again .
Has Mr. Tulkinghorn been disturbed ?
His windows are dark and quiet , and his door is shut .
It must be something unusual indeed to bring him out of his <unk> .
Nothing is heard of him , nothing is seen of him .
What power of <unk> might it take to shake that rusty old man out of his immovable composure ?
For many years the <unk> Roman has been pointing , with no particular meaning , from that ceiling .
It is not likely that he has any new meaning in him to-night .
Once pointing , always pointing — like any Roman , or even <unk> , with a single idea .
There he is , no doubt , in his impossible attitude , pointing , <unk> , all night long .
<unk> , darkness , <unk> , <unk> , day .
There he is still , <unk> pointing , and no one minds him .
But a little after the coming of the day come people to clean the rooms .
And either the Roman has some new meaning in him , not expressed before , or the foremost of them goes wild , for looking up at his <unk> hand and looking down at what is below it , that person <unk> and flies .
The others , looking in as the first one looked , <unk> and fly too , and there is an alarm in the street .
What does it mean ?
No light is admitted into the darkened chamber , and people <unk> to it enter , and <unk> softly but heavily , carry a weight into the bedroom and lay it down .
There is whispering and wondering all day , strict search of every corner , careful <unk> of steps , and careful <unk> of the disposition of every article of furniture .
All eyes look up at the Roman , and all voices murmur , “ If he could only tell what he saw ! ” He is pointing at a table with a bottle ( nearly full of wine ) and a glass upon it and two candles that were blown out suddenly soon after being lighted .
He is pointing at an empty chair and at a <unk> upon the ground before it that might be almost covered with a hand .
These objects lie directly within his <unk> .
An excited imagination might suppose that there was something in them so terrific as to drive the rest of the composition , not only the attendant <unk> boys , but the clouds and flowers and <unk> too — in short , the very body and soul of Allegory , and all the brains it has — <unk> mad .
It happens surely that every one who comes into the darkened room and looks at these things looks up at the Roman and that he is <unk> in all eyes with mystery and awe , as if he were a <unk> dumb witness .
So it shall happen surely , through many years to come , that ghostly stories shall be told of the <unk> upon the floor , so easy to be covered , so hard to be got out , and that the Roman , pointing from the ceiling shall point , so long as dust and damp and <unk> spare him , with far greater <unk> than he ever had in Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s time , and with a deadly meaning .
For Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s time is over for evermore , and the Roman pointed at the murderous hand <unk> against his life , and pointed <unk> at him , from night to morning , lying face downward on the floor , shot through the heart .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> <unk> A great <unk> occasion has come round in the establishment of Mr. Matthew Bagnet , otherwise Lignum <unk> , <unk> and present <unk> .
An occasion of <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> of a birthday in the family .
It is not Mr. Bagnet ’ s birthday .
Mr. Bagnet merely <unk> that <unk> in the musical instrument business by kissing the children with an extra <unk> before breakfast , smoking an additional pipe after dinner , and wondering towards evening what his poor old mother is thinking about it — a subject of infinite speculation , and rendered so by his mother having departed this life twenty years .
Some men rarely <unk> to their father , but seem , in the <unk> of their remembrance , to have <unk> all the stock of <unk> affection into their mother ’ s name .
Mr. Bagnet is one of these .
Perhaps his <unk> appreciation of the merits of the old girl causes him usually to make the <unk> “ goodness ” of the <unk> <unk> .
It is not the birthday of one of the three children .
Those occasions are kept with some marks of distinction , but they rarely <unk> the <unk> of happy returns and a <unk> .
On young Woolwich ’ s last birthday , Mr. Bagnet certainly did , after observing on his growth and general <unk> , proceed , in a moment of profound reflection on the changes <unk> by time , to <unk> him in the <unk> , <unk> with extreme <unk> the questions number one and two , “ What is your name ? ” and “ Who gave you that name ? ” but there <unk> in the exact <unk> of his memory and <unk> for number three the question “ And how do you like that name ? ” which he <unk> with a sense of its importance , in itself so <unk> and improving as to give it quite an <unk> air .
This , however , was a <unk> on that particular birthday , and not a general <unk> .
It is the old girl ’ s birthday , and that is the greatest <unk> and <unk> day in Mr. Bagnet ’ s <unk> .
The <unk> event is always <unk> according to certain forms settled and <unk> by Mr. Bagnet some years since .
Mr. Bagnet , being deeply convinced that to have a pair of fowls for dinner is to <unk> the highest pitch of <unk> <unk> , invariably goes forth himself very early in the morning of this day to buy a pair ; he is , as invariably , taken in by the <unk> and <unk> in the possession of the oldest inhabitants of any <unk> in Europe .
<unk> with these <unk> of <unk> tied up in a clean blue and white <unk> handkerchief ( essential to the arrangements ) , he in a <unk> manner <unk> Mrs. Bagnet to declare at breakfast what she would like for dinner .
Mrs. Bagnet , by a coincidence never known to fail , replying fowls , Mr. Bagnet instantly produces his bundle from a place of <unk> <unk> general amazement and <unk> .
He further requires that the old girl shall do nothing all day long but sit in her very best gown and be served by himself and the young people .
As he is not illustrious for his <unk> , this may be supposed to be a matter of state rather than enjoyment on the old girl ’ s part , but she keeps her state with all <unk> cheerfulness .
On this present birthday , Mr. Bagnet has accomplished the usual <unk> .
He has bought two specimens of poultry , which , if there be any truth in <unk> , were certainly not caught with <unk> , to be prepared for the <unk> ; he has amazed and rejoiced the family by their <unk> <unk> ; he is himself directing the <unk> of the poultry ; and Mrs. Bagnet , with her wholesome brown fingers <unk> to prevent what she sees going wrong , sits in her gown of ceremony , an honoured guest .
Quebec and Malta lay the cloth for dinner , while Woolwich , <unk> , as <unk> him , under his father , keeps the fowls revolving .
To these young <unk> Mrs. Bagnet occasionally <unk> a wink , or a shake of the head , or a crooked face , as they made mistakes .
“ At half after one . ” Says Mr. Bagnet .
“ To the minute .
They ’ ll be done . ” Mrs. Bagnet , with <unk> , beholds one of them at a <unk> before the fire and beginning to burn .
“ You shall have a dinner , old girl , ” says Mr. Bagnet .
“ <unk> for a queen . ” Mrs. Bagnet shows her white teeth cheerfully , but to the perception of her son , <unk> so much uneasiness of spirit that he is <unk> by the <unk> of affection to ask her , with his eyes , what is the matter , thus standing , with his eyes wide open , more <unk> of the fowls than before , and not <unk> the least hope of a return to consciousness .
<unk> his elder sister perceives the cause of the agitation in Mrs. Bagnet ’ s breast and with an <unk> poke recalls him .
The stopped fowls going round again , Mrs. Bagnet closes her eyes in the <unk> of her relief .
“ George will look us up , ” says Mr. Bagnet .
“ At half after four .
To the moment .
How many years , old girl .
Has George looked us up .
This afternoon ? ” “ Ah , Lignum , Lignum , as many as make an old woman of a young one , I begin to think .
Just about that , and no less , ” returns Mrs. Bagnet , laughing and shaking her head .
“ Old girl , ” says Mr. Bagnet , “ never mind .
You ’ d be as young as ever you was .
If you wasn ’ t younger .
Which you are .
As everybody knows . ” Quebec and Malta here <unk> , with clapping of hands , that Bluffy is sure to bring mother something , and begin to <unk> on what it will be .
“ Do you know , Lignum , ” says Mrs. Bagnet , casting a glance on the <unk> , and winking “ <unk> ! ” at Malta with her right eye , and shaking the <unk> away from Quebec with her head , “ I begin to think George is in the <unk> way again . ” “ George , ” returns Mr. Bagnet , “ will never desert .
And leave his old comrade .
In the <unk> .
Don ’ t be afraid of it . ” “ No , Lignum .
No .
I don ’ t say he will .
I don ’ t think he will .
But if he could get over this money trouble of his , I believe he would be off . ” Mr. Bagnet asks why .
“ Well , ” returns his wife , considering , “ George seems to me to be getting not a little impatient and restless .
I don ’ t say but what he ’ s as free as ever .
Of course he must be free or he wouldn ’ t be George , but he <unk> and seems put out . ” “ He ’ s <unk> , ” says Mr. Bagnet .
“ By a lawyer .
Who would put the devil out . ” “ There ’ s something in that , ” his wife <unk> ; “ but so it is , Lignum . ” <unk> conversation is prevented , for the time , by the necessity under which Mr. Bagnet finds himself of directing the whole force of his mind to the dinner , which is a little <unk> by the dry humour of the fowls in not yielding any gravy , and also by the made gravy <unk> no flavour and turning out of a <unk> complexion .
With a similar <unk> , the potatoes <unk> off <unk> in the process of <unk> , <unk> from their <unk> in every direction , as if they were subject to <unk> .
The legs of the fowls , too , are longer than could be desired , and extremely <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> to the best of his <unk> , Mr. Bagnet at last <unk> and they sit down at table , Mrs. Bagnet <unk> the guest ’ s place at his right hand .
It is well for the old girl that she has but one birthday in a year , for two such <unk> in poultry might be <unk> .
Every kind of finer <unk> and <unk> that is in the nature of poultry to possess is developed in these specimens in the singular form of <unk> .
Their <unk> appear to have struck <unk> into their <unk> and bodies , as aged trees strike <unk> into the earth .
Their legs are so hard as to encourage the idea that they must have devoted the greater part of their long and <unk> lives to <unk> <unk> and the walking of <unk> .
But Mr. Bagnet , unconscious of these little <unk> , sets his heart on Mrs. Bagnet eating a most severe quantity of the <unk> before her ; and as that good old girl would not cause him a moment ’ s disappointment on any day , least of all on such a day , for any consideration , she <unk> her digestion fearfully .
How young Woolwich <unk> the <unk> without being of <unk> <unk> , his anxious mother is at a loss to understand .
The old girl has another trial to <unk> after the conclusion of the <unk> in sitting in state to see the room cleared , the hearth <unk> , and the <unk> washed up and <unk> in the backyard .
The great delight and energy with which the two young ladies apply themselves to these duties , turning up their skirts in imitation of their mother and <unk> in and out on little <unk> of pattens , <unk> the highest hopes for the future , but some anxiety for the present .
The same causes lead to confusion of <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> of tin <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> , and an <unk> of water , all in <unk> , while the <unk> of the young ladies themselves is almost too moving a spectacle for Mrs. Bagnet to look upon with the calmness proper to her position .
At last the various <unk> <unk> are triumphantly completed ; Quebec and Malta appear in fresh <unk> , smiling and dry ; pipes , tobacco , and something to drink are placed upon the table ; and the old girl <unk> the first peace of mind she ever knows on the day of this delightful entertainment .
When Mr. Bagnet takes his usual seat , the hands of the clock are very near to half-past four ; as they mark it <unk> , Mr. Bagnet <unk> , “ George !
<unk> time . ” It is George , and he has hearty <unk> for the old girl ( whom he kisses on the great occasion ) , and for the children , and for Mr. Bagnet .
“ <unk> returns to all ! ” says Mr. George .
“ But , George , old man ! ” cries Mrs. Bagnet , looking at him curiously .
“ What ’ s come to you ? ” “ Come to me ? ” “ Ah !
You are so white , George — for you — and look so shocked .
Now don ’ t he , Lignum ? ” “ George , ” says Mr. Bagnet , “ tell the old girl .
What ’ s the matter . ” “ I didn ’ t know I looked white , ” says the trooper , passing his hand over his brow , “ and I didn ’ t know I looked shocked , and I ’ m sorry I do .
But the truth is , that boy who was taken in at my place died yesterday afternoon , and it has rather knocked me over . ” “ Poor <unk> ! ” says Mrs. Bagnet with a mother ’ s pity .
“ Is he gone ?
Dear , dear ! ” “ I didn ’ t mean to say anything about it , for it ’ s not birthday talk , but you have got it out of me , you see , before I sit down .
I should have <unk> up in a minute , ” says the trooper , making himself speak more gaily , “ but you ’ re so quick , Mrs. Bagnet . ” “ You ’ re right .
The old girl , ” says Mr. Bagnet .
“ Is as quick .
As powder . ” “ And what ’ s more , she ’ s the subject of the day , and we ’ ll stick to her , ” cries Mr. George .
“ See here , I have brought a little <unk> along with me .
It ’ s a poor thing , you know , but it ’ s a <unk> .
That ’ s all the good it is , Mrs. Bagnet . ” Mr. George produces his present , which is <unk> with admiring <unk> and <unk> by the young family , and with a species of <unk> admiration by Mr. Bagnet .
“ Old girl , ” says Mr. Bagnet .
“ Tell him my opinion of it . ” “ Why , it ’ s a wonder , George ! ” Mrs. Bagnet exclaims .
“ It ’ s the <unk> thing that ever was seen ! ” “ Good ! ” says Mr. Bagnet .
“ My opinion . ” “ It ’ s so pretty , George , ” cries Mrs. Bagnet , turning it on all sides and holding it out at arm ’ s length , “ that it seems too choice for me . ” “ <unk> ! ” says Mr. Bagnet .
“ Not my opinion . ” “ But whatever it is , a hundred thousand thanks , old fellow , ” says Mrs. Bagnet , her eyes sparkling with pleasure and her hand stretched out to him ; “ and though I have been a <unk> soldier ’ s wife to you sometimes , George , we are as strong friends , I am sure , in reality , as ever can be .
Now you shall <unk> it on yourself , for good luck , if you will , George . ” The children close up to see it done , and Mr. Bagnet looks over young Woolwich ’ s head to see it done with an interest so <unk> wooden , yet pleasantly childish , that Mrs. Bagnet cannot help laughing in her airy way and saying , “ Oh , Lignum , Lignum , what a precious old chap you are ! ” But the trooper <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
His hand shakes , he is nervous , and it falls off .
“ Would any one believe this ? ” says he , catching it as it drops and looking round .
“ I am so out of sorts that I <unk> at an easy job like this ! ” Mrs. Bagnet concludes that for such a case there is no remedy like a pipe , and <unk> the <unk> herself in a <unk> , causes the trooper to be <unk> into his usual <unk> place and the pipes to be got into action .
“ If that don ’ t bring you round , George , ” says she , “ just throw your eye across here at your present now and then , and the two together MUST do it . ” “ You ought to do it of yourself , ” George answers ; “ I know that very well , Mrs. Bagnet .
I ’ ll tell you how , one way and another , the <unk> have got to be too many for me .
Here was this poor lad .
’ <unk> dull work to see him dying as he did , and not be able to help him . ” “ What do you mean , George ?
You did help him .
You took him under your roof . ” “ I helped him so far , but that ’ s little .
I mean , Mrs. Bagnet , there he was , dying without ever having been taught much more than to know his right hand from his left .
And he was too far gone to be helped out of that . ” “ Ah , poor <unk> ! ” says Mrs. Bagnet .
“ Then , ” says the trooper , not yet lighting his pipe , and passing his heavy hand over his hair , “ that brought up Gridley in a man ’ s mind .
His was a bad case too , in a different way .
Then the two got mixed up in a man ’ s mind with a <unk> old <unk> who had to do with both .
And to think of that rusty <unk> , stock and <unk> , standing up on end in his corner , hard , indifferent , taking everything so <unk> — it made flesh and blood <unk> , I do assure you . ” “ My advice to you , ” returns Mrs. Bagnet , “ is to light your pipe and <unk> that way .
It ’ s <unk> and <unk> , and better for the health altogether . ” “ You ’ re right , ” says the trooper , “ and I ’ ll do it . ” So he does it , though still with an indignant gravity that <unk> the young <unk> , and even causes Mr. Bagnet to <unk> the ceremony of drinking Mrs. Bagnet ’ s health , always given by himself on these occasions in a speech of exemplary <unk> .
But the young ladies having composed what Mr. Bagnet is in the habit of calling “ the <unk> , ” and George ’ s pipe being now in a glow , Mr. Bagnet considers it his duty to proceed to the toast of the evening .
He addresses the assembled company in the following terms .
“ George .
Woolwich .
Quebec .
Malta .
This is her birthday .
Take a day ’ s march .
And you won ’ t find such another .
Here ’ s towards her ! ” The toast having been drunk with enthusiasm , Mrs. Bagnet returns thanks in a neat address of <unk> <unk> .
This model composition is limited to the three words “ And <unk> yours ! ” which the old girl follows up with a nod at everybody in succession and a <unk> <unk> of the mixture .
This she again follows up , on the present occasion , by the wholly unexpected exclamation , “ Here ’ s a man ! ” Here IS a man , much to the astonishment of the little company , looking in at the <unk> .
He is a <unk> man — a quick keen man — and he takes in everybody ’ s look at him , all at once , <unk> and <unk> , in a manner that <unk> him a remarkable man .
“ George , ” says the man , nodding , “ how do you find yourself ? ” “ Why , it ’ s Bucket ! ” cries Mr. George .
“ Yes , ” says the man , coming in and closing the door .
“ I was going down the street here when I happened to stop and look in at the musical <unk> in the <unk> — a friend of mine is in want of a second-hand wiolinceller of a good tone — and I saw a party enjoying themselves , and I thought it was you in the corner ; I thought I couldn ’ t be mistaken .
How goes the world with you , George , at the present moment ?
Pretty smooth ?
And with you , ma ’ am ?
And with you , governor ?
And Lord , ” says Mr. Bucket , opening his arms , “ here ’ s children too !
You may do anything with me if you only show me children .
Give us a kiss , my <unk> .
No occasion to inquire who YOUR father and mother is .
Never saw such a likeness in my life ! ” Mr. Bucket , not <unk> , has sat himself down next to Mr. George and taken Quebec and Malta on his knees .
“ You pretty dears , ” says Mr. Bucket , “ give us another kiss ; it ’ s the only thing I ’ m <unk> in .
Lord bless you , how healthy you look !
And what may be the ages of these two , ma ’ am ?
I should put ’ em down at the figures of about eight and ten . ” “ You ’ re very near , sir , ” says Mrs. Bagnet .
“ I generally am near , ” returns Mr. Bucket , “ being so fond of children .
A friend of mine has had <unk> of ’ em , ma ’ am , all by one mother , and she ’ s still as fresh and rosy as the morning .
Not so much so as yourself , but , upon my soul , she comes near you !
And what do you call these , my darling ? ” pursues Mr. Bucket , pinching Malta ’ s cheeks .
“ These are <unk> , these are .
Bless your heart !
And what do you think about father ?
Do you think father could recommend a second-hand wiolinceller of a good tone for Mr. Bucket ’ s friend , my dear ?
My name ’ s Bucket .
Ain ’ t that a <unk> name ? ” These <unk> have entirely won the family heart .
Mrs. Bagnet <unk> the day to the extent of filling a pipe and a glass for Mr. Bucket and waiting upon him <unk> .
She would be glad to receive so pleasant a character under any circumstances , but she tells him that as a friend of George ’ s she is particularly glad to see him this evening , for George has not been in his usual spirits .
“ Not in his usual spirits ? ” exclaims Mr. Bucket .
“ Why , I never heard of such a thing !
What ’ s the matter , George ?
You don ’ t intend to tell me you ’ ve been out of spirits .
What should you be out of spirits for ?
You haven ’ t got anything on your mind , you know . ” “ Nothing particular , ” returns the trooper .
“ I should think not , ” rejoins Mr. Bucket .
“ What could you have on your mind , you know !
And have these <unk> got anything on THEIR minds , eh ?
Not they , but they ’ ll be upon the minds of some of the young <unk> , some of these days , and make ’ em precious low-spirited .
I ain ’ t much of a <unk> , but I can tell you that , ma ’ am . ” Mrs. Bagnet , quite charmed , hopes Mr. Bucket has a family of his own .
“ There , ma ’ am ! ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Would you believe it ?
No , I haven ’ t .
My wife and a lodger <unk> my family .
Mrs. Bucket is as fond of children as myself and as <unk> to have ’ em , but no .
So it is .
<unk> <unk> are divided <unk> , and man must not <unk> .
What a very nice backyard , ma ’ am !
Any way out of that yard , now ? ” There is no way out of that yard .
“ Ain ’ t there really ? ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ I should have thought there might have been .
Well , I don ’ t know as I ever saw a backyard that took my fancy more .
Would you allow me to look at it ?
Thank you .
No , I see there ’ s no way out .
But what a very <unk> yard it is ! ” Having cast his sharp eye all about it , Mr. Bucket returns to his chair next his friend Mr. George and <unk> Mr. George affectionately on the shoulder .
“ How are your spirits now , George ? ” “ All right now , ” returns the trooper .
“ That ’ s your sort ! ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Why should you ever have been otherwise ?
A man of your fine figure and <unk> has no right to be out of spirits .
That ain ’ t a chest to be out of spirits , is it , ma ’ am ?
And you haven ’ t got anything on your mind , you know , George ; what could you have on your mind ! ” <unk> <unk> on this phrase , considering the extent and variety of his <unk> <unk> , Mr. Bucket twice or <unk> repeats it to the pipe he lights , and with a listening face that is particularly his own .
But the sun of his <unk> soon recovers from this brief <unk> and shines again .
“ And this is brother , is it , my dears ? ” says Mr. Bucket , referring to Quebec and Malta for information on the subject of young Woolwich .
“ And a nice brother he is — <unk> I mean to say .
For he ’ s too old to be your boy , ma ’ am . ” “ I can <unk> at all events that he is not anybody else ’ s , ” returns Mrs. Bagnet , laughing .
“ Well , you do surprise me !
Yet he ’ s like you , there ’ s no <unk> .
Lord , he ’ s wonderfully like you !
But about what you may call the brow , you know , <unk> his father comes out ! ” Mr. Bucket <unk> the faces with one eye shut up , while Mr. Bagnet smokes in <unk> satisfaction .
This is an opportunity for Mrs. Bagnet to inform him that the boy is George ’ s godson .
“ George ’ s godson , is he ? ” rejoins Mr. Bucket with extreme <unk> .
“ I must shake hands over again with George ’ s godson .
<unk> and godson do credit to one another .
And what do you intend to make of him , ma ’ am ?
Does he show any turn for any musical instrument ? ” Mr. Bagnet suddenly interposes , “ <unk> the fife .
<unk> . ” “ Would you believe it , governor , ” says Mr. Bucket , struck by the coincidence , “ that when I was a boy I played the fife myself ?
Not in a <unk> way , as I expect he does , but by ear .
Lord bless you !
‘ British <unk> ’ — there ’ s a tune to warm an <unk> up !
<unk> you give us ‘ British <unk> , ’ my fine fellow ? ” Nothing could be more <unk> to the little circle than this call upon young Woolwich , who immediately <unk> his fife and <unk> the stirring <unk> , during which <unk> Mr. Bucket , much <unk> , beats time and never <unk> to come in sharp with the burden , “ British <unk> ! ” In short , he shows so much musical taste that Mr. Bagnet actually takes his pipe from his lips to express his conviction that he is a <unk> .
Mr. Bucket receives the <unk> <unk> so modestly , <unk> how that he did once <unk> a little , for the expression of the feelings of his own bosom , and with no <unk> idea of <unk> his friends , that he is asked to sing .
Not to be <unk> in the <unk> of the evening , he <unk> and gives them “ <unk> Me , if All Those <unk> Young <unk> . ” This <unk> , he informs Mrs. Bagnet , he considers to have been his most powerful <unk> in moving the heart of Mrs. Bucket when a <unk> , and <unk> her to approach the <unk> — Mr.
Bucket ’ s own words are “ to come up to the scratch . ” This sparkling stranger is such a new and agreeable feature in the evening that Mr. George , who <unk> no great emotions of pleasure on his entrance , begins , in spite of himself , to be rather proud of him .
He is so friendly , is a man of so many <unk> , and so easy to get on with , that it is something to have made him known there .
Mr. Bagnet becomes , after another pipe , so sensible of the value of his acquaintance that he <unk> the honour of his company on the old girl ’ s next birthday .
If anything can more closely <unk> and <unk> the esteem which Mr. Bucket has formed for the family , it is the discovery of the nature of the occasion .
He drinks to Mrs. Bagnet with a warmth approaching to rapture , engages himself for that day <unk> more than <unk> , makes a <unk> of the day in a large black <unk> with a <unk> to it , and <unk> a hope that Mrs. Bucket and Mrs. Bagnet may before then become , in a manner , sisters .
As he says himself , what is public life without private <unk> ?
He is in his humble way a public man , but it is not in that <unk> that he finds happiness .
No , it must be sought within the <unk> of domestic <unk> .
It is natural , under these circumstances , that he , in his turn , should remember the friend to whom he is <unk> for so promising an acquaintance .
And he does .
He keeps very close to him .
Whatever the subject of the conversation , he keeps a tender eye upon him .
He <unk> to walk home with him .
He is interested in his very boots and observes even them attentively as Mr. George sits smoking <unk> in the <unk> .
At length Mr. George rises to depart .
At the same moment Mr. Bucket , with the secret sympathy of friendship , also rises .
He <unk> upon the children to the last and remembers the commission he has <unk> for an absent friend .
“ <unk> that second-hand wiolinceller , governor — could you recommend me such a thing ? ” “ <unk> , ” says Mr. Bagnet .
“ I am obliged to you , ” returns Mr. Bucket , <unk> his hand .
“ You ’ re a friend in need .
A good tone , mind you !
My friend is a regular <unk> at it .
<unk> , he <unk> away at <unk> and <unk> and the rest of the <unk> like a <unk> workman .
And you needn ’ t , ” says Mr. Bucket in a considerate and private voice , “ you needn ’ t commit yourself to too low a figure , governor .
I don ’ t want to pay too large a price for my friend , but I want you to have your proper <unk> and be <unk> for your loss of time .
That is but fair .
Every man must live , and ought to it . ” Mr. Bagnet shakes his head at the old girl to the effect that they have found a jewel of price .
“ Suppose I was to give you a look in , say , at half <unk> ten to-morrow morning .
Perhaps you could name the figures of a few <unk> of a good tone ? ” says Mr. Bucket .
Nothing easier .
Mr. and Mrs. Bagnet both engage to have the <unk> information ready and even hint to each other at the <unk> of having a small stock collected there for approval .
“ Thank you , ” says Mr. Bucket , “ thank you .
Good night , ma ’ am .
Good night , governor .
Good night , <unk> .
I am much obliged to you for one of the pleasantest evenings I ever spent in my life . ” They , on the contrary , are much obliged to him for the pleasure he has given them in his company ; and so they part with many expressions of <unk> on both sides .
“ Now George , old boy , ” says Mr. Bucket , taking his arm at the shop-door , “ come along ! ” As they go down the little street and the <unk> pause for a minute looking after them , Mrs. Bagnet remarks to the worthy Lignum that Mr. Bucket “ almost <unk> to George like , and seems to be really fond of him . ” The neighbouring streets being narrow and <unk> , it is a little inconvenient to walk there two <unk> and arm in arm .
Mr. George therefore soon proposes to walk <unk> .
But Mr. Bucket , who cannot make up his mind to <unk> his friendly hold , replies , “ <unk> half a minute , George .
I should wish to speak to you first . ” <unk> afterwards , he <unk> him into a public-house and into a parlour , where he <unk> him and <unk> his own back against the door .
“ Now , George , ” says Mr. Bucket , “ duty is duty , and friendship is friendship .
I never want the two to <unk> if I can help it .
I have <unk> to make things pleasant to-night , and I put it to you whether I have done it or not .
You must consider yourself in custody , George . ” “ <unk> ?
What for ? ” returns the trooper , <unk> .
“ Now , George , ” says Mr. Bucket , <unk> a sensible view of the case upon him with his fat forefinger , “ duty , as you know very well , is one thing , and conversation is another .
It ’ s my duty to inform you that any observations you may make will be liable to be used against you .
Therefore , George , be careful what you say .
You don ’ t happen to have heard of a murder ? ” “ <unk> ! ” “ Now , George , ” says Mr. Bucket , keeping his forefinger in an impressive state of action , “ bear in mind what I ’ ve said to you .
I ask you nothing .
You ’ ve been in low spirits this afternoon .
I say , you don ’ t happen to have heard of a murder ? ” “ No .
Where has there been a murder ? ” “ Now , George , ” says Mr. Bucket , “ don ’ t you go and commit yourself .
I ’ m a-going to tell you what I want you for .
There has been a murder in Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields — gentleman of the name of Tulkinghorn .
He was shot last night .
I want you for that . ” The trooper <unk> upon a seat behind him , and great drops start out upon his forehead , and a deadly <unk> <unk> his face .
“ Bucket !
It ’ s not possible that Mr. Tulkinghorn has been killed and that you suspect ME ? ” “ George , ” returns Mr. Bucket , keeping his forefinger going , “ it is certainly possible , because it ’ s the case .
This deed was done last night at ten o ’ clock .
Now , you know where you were last night at ten o ’ clock , and you ’ ll be able to prove it , no doubt . ” “ <unk> night !
<unk> night ? ” repeats the trooper thoughtfully .
Then it <unk> upon him .
“ Why , great heaven , I was there last night ! ” “ So I have understood , George , ” returns Mr. Bucket with great <unk> .
“ So I have understood .
<unk> you ’ ve been very often there .
You ’ ve been seen hanging about the place , and you ’ ve been heard more than once in a <unk> with him , and it ’ s possible — I don ’ t say it ’ s certainly so , mind you , but it ’ s possible — that he may have been heard to call you a threatening , <unk> , dangerous fellow . ” The trooper gasps as if he would admit it all if he could speak .
“ Now , George , ” continues Mr. Bucket , putting his hat upon the table with an air of business rather in the <unk> way than otherwise , “ my wish is , as it has been all the evening , to make things pleasant .
I tell you plainly there ’ s a reward out , of a hundred guineas , offered by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet .
You and me have always been pleasant together ; but I have got a duty to discharge ; and if that hundred guineas is to be made , it may as well be made by me as any other man .
On all of which accounts , I should hope it was clear to you that I must have you , and that I ’ m <unk> if I don ’ t have you .
Am I to call in any assistance , or is the <unk> done ? ” Mr. George has recovered himself and stands up like a soldier .
“ Come , ” he says ; “ I am ready . ” “ George , ” continues Mr. Bucket , “ wait a bit ! ” With his <unk> manner , as if the trooper were a window to be <unk> up , he takes from his pocket a pair of <unk> .
“ This is a serious charge , George , and such is my duty . ” The trooper <unk> angrily and <unk> a moment , but holds out his two hands , clasped together , and says , “ There !
Put them on ! ” Mr. Bucket adjusts them in a moment .
“ How do you find them ?
Are they comfortable ?
If not , say so , for I wish to make things as pleasant as is <unk> with my duty , and I ’ ve got another pair in my pocket . ” This remark he offers like a most respectable <unk> anxious to execute an order neatly and to the perfect satisfaction of his customer .
“ They ’ ll do as they are ?
Very well !
Now , you see , George ” — he takes a cloak from a corner and begins adjusting it about the trooper ’ s neck — “ I was <unk> of your feelings when I come out , and brought this on purpose .
There !
Who ’ s the wiser ? ” “ Only I , ” returns the trooper , “ but as I know it , do me one more good turn and pull my hat over my eyes . ” “ Really , though !
Do you mean it ?
Ain ’ t it a pity ?
It looks so . ” “ I can ’ t look chance men in the face with these things on , ” Mr. George hurriedly replies .
“ Do , for God ’ s sake , pull my hat forward . ” So strongly entreated , Mr. Bucket <unk> , puts his own hat on , and <unk> his <unk> into the streets , the trooper <unk> on as steadily as usual , though with his head less <unk> , and Mr. Bucket <unk> him with his elbow over the <unk> and up the <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> Esther ’ s Narrative It happened that when I came home from <unk> I found a note from Caddy Jellyby ( as we always continued to call her ) , informing me that her health , which had been for some time very delicate , was worse and that she would be more glad than she could tell me if I would go to see her .
It was a note of a few lines , written from the couch on which she lay and enclosed to me in another from her husband , in which he <unk> her entreaty with much <unk> .
Caddy was now the mother , and I the godmother , of such a poor little baby — such a tiny <unk> mite , with a countenance that seemed to be scarcely anything but <unk> , and a little lean , <unk> hand , always <unk> under its chin .
It would lie in this attitude all day , with its bright <unk> of eyes open , wondering ( as I used to imagine ) how it came to be so small and weak .
Whenever it was moved it cried , but at all other times it was so patient that the sole desire of its life appeared to be to lie quiet and think .
It had curious little dark <unk> in its face and curious little dark marks under its eyes like faint remembrances of poor Caddy ’ s inky days , and altogether , to those who were not used to it , it was quite a <unk> little sight .
But it was enough for Caddy that <unk> was used to it .
The <unk> with which she <unk> her illness , for little Esther ’ s education , and little Esther ’ s marriage , and even for her own old age as the grandmother of little Esther ’ s little <unk> , was so <unk> expressive of devotion to this pride of her life that I should be tempted to recall some of them but for the <unk> remembrance that I am getting on <unk> as it is .
To return to the letter .
Caddy had a <unk> about me which had been strengthening in her mind ever since that night long ago when she had <unk> asleep with her head in my lap .
She almost — I think I must say quite — believed that I did her good whenever I was near her .
Now although this was such a fancy of the affectionate girl ’ s that I am almost ashamed to mention it , still it might have all the force of a fact when she was really ill .
Therefore I set off to Caddy , with my guardian ’ s consent , <unk> ; and she and Prince made so much of me that there never was anything like it .
Next day I went again to sit with her , and next day I went again .
It was a very easy journey , for I had only to rise a little earlier in the morning , and keep my accounts , and attend to housekeeping matters before leaving home .
But when I had made these three visits , my guardian said to me , on my return at night , “ Now , little woman , little woman , this will never do .
<unk> <unk> will wear away a stone , and constant <unk> will wear out a Dame Durden .
We will go to London for a while and take possession of our old lodgings . ” “ Not for me , dear guardian , ” said I , “ for I never feel tired , ” which was strictly true .
I was only too happy to be in such request .
“ For me then , ” returned my guardian , “ or for Ada , or for both of us .
It is somebody ’ s birthday to-morrow , I think . ” “ Truly I think it is , ” said I , kissing my darling , who would be <unk> to-morrow .
“ Well , ” observed my guardian , half pleasantly , half seriously , “ that ’ s a great occasion and will give my fair cousin some necessary business to <unk> in <unk> of her independence , and will make London a more convenient place for all of us .
So to London we will go .
That being settled , there is another thing — how have you left Caddy ? ” “ Very <unk> , guardian .
I fear it will be some time before she <unk> her health and strength . ” “ What do you call some time , now ? ” asked my guardian thoughtfully .
“ Some weeks , I am afraid . ” “ Ah ! ” He began to walk about the room with his hands in his pockets , showing that he had been thinking as much .
“ Now , what do you say about her doctor ?
Is he a good doctor , my love ? ” I felt obliged to confess that I knew nothing to the contrary but that Prince and I had agreed only that evening that we would like his opinion to be confirmed by some one .
“ Well , you know , ” returned my guardian quickly , “ there ’ s Woodcourt . ” I had not meant that , and was rather taken by surprise .
For a moment all that I had had in my mind in connexion with Mr. Woodcourt seemed to come back and <unk> me .
“ You don ’ t object to him , little woman ? ” “ <unk> to him , guardian ?
Oh no ! ” “ And you don ’ t think the patient would object to him ? ” So far from that , I had no doubt of her being prepared to have a great reliance on him and to like him very much .
I said that he was no stranger to her personally , for she had seen him often in his kind attendance on Miss Flite .
“ Very good , ” said my guardian .
“ He has been here to-day , my dear , and I will see him about it to-morrow . ” I felt in this short conversation — though I did not know how , for she was quiet , and we <unk> no look — that my dear girl well remembered how <unk> she had clasped me round the waist when no other hands than Caddy ’ s had brought me the little parting <unk> .
This caused me to feel that I ought to tell her , and Caddy too , that I was going to be the mistress of Bleak House and that if I <unk> that <unk> any longer I might become less worthy in my own eyes of its master ’ s love .
Therefore , when we went upstairs and had waited listening until the clock struck twelve in order that only I might be the first to wish my darling all good wishes on her birthday and to take her to my heart , I set before her , just as I had set before myself , the goodness and honour of her cousin John and the happy life that was in <unk> for me .
If ever my darling were <unk> of me at one time than another in all our <unk> , she was surely <unk> of me that night .
And I was so rejoiced to know it and so <unk> by the sense of having done right in casting this last idle reservation away that I was ten times happier than I had been before .
I had scarcely thought it a reservation a few hours ago , but now that it was gone I felt as if I understood its nature better .
Next day we went to London .
We found our old lodging vacant , and in half an hour were quietly established there , as if we had never gone away .
Mr. Woodcourt <unk> with us to <unk> my darling ’ s birthday , and we were as pleasant as we could be with the great blank among us that Richard ’ s absence naturally made on such an occasion .
After that day I was for some weeks — eight or nine as I remember — very much with Caddy , and thus it fell out that I saw less of Ada at this time than any other since we had first come together , except the time of my own illness .
She often came to Caddy ’ s , but our <unk> there was to <unk> and cheer her , and we did not talk in our usual confidential manner .
Whenever I went home at night we were together , but Caddy ’ s rest was broken by pain , and I often remained to nurse her .
With her husband and her poor little mite of a baby to love and their home to <unk> for , what a good creature Caddy was !
So <unk> , so <unk> , so anxious to get well on their account , so afraid of giving trouble , and so thoughtful of the <unk> labours of her husband and the comforts of old Mr. Turveydrop ; I had never known the best of her until now .
And it seemed so curious that her pale face and helpless figure should be lying there day after day where dancing was the business of life , where the kit and the apprentices began early every morning in the <unk> , and where the untidy little boy <unk> by himself in the kitchen all the afternoon .
At Caddy ’ s request I took the <unk> direction of her apartment , <unk> it up , and pushed her , couch and all , into a <unk> and more airy and more cheerful corner than she had yet occupied ; then , every day , when we were in our <unk> array , I used to lay my small small <unk> in her arms and sit down to <unk> or work or read to her .
It was at one of the first of these quiet times that I told Caddy about Bleak House .
We had other visitors besides Ada .
First of all we had Prince , who in his hurried intervals of teaching used to come softly in and sit softly down , with a face of loving anxiety for Caddy and the very little child .
Whatever Caddy ’ s condition really was , she never failed to declare to Prince that she was all but well — which I , heaven forgive me , never failed to confirm .
This would put Prince in such good spirits that he would sometimes take the kit from his pocket and play a <unk> or two to <unk> the baby , which I never knew it to do in the least degree , for my tiny <unk> never noticed it at all .
Then there was Mrs. Jellyby .
She would come occasionally , with her usual <unk> manner , and sit calmly looking miles beyond her <unk> as if her attention were absorbed by a young Borrioboolan on its native <unk> .
As bright-eyed as ever , as serene , and as untidy , she would say , “ Well , Caddy , child , and how do you do to-day ? ” And then would sit <unk> smiling and taking no notice of the reply or would <unk> <unk> off into a calculation of the number of letters she had lately received and answered or of the <unk> power of Borrioboola-Gha .
This she would always do with a serene contempt for our limited <unk> of action , not to be <unk> .
Then there was old Mr. Turveydrop , who was from morning to night and from night to morning the subject of innumerable precautions .
If the baby cried , it was nearly <unk> lest the noise should make him uncomfortable .
If the fire wanted stirring in the night , it was <unk> done lest his rest should be broken .
If Caddy required any little comfort that the house contained , she first carefully discussed whether he was likely to require it too .
In return for this consideration he would come into the room once a day , all but blessing it — showing a condescension , and a patronage , and a grace of manner in <unk> the light of his high-shouldered presence from which I might have supposed him ( if I had not known better ) to have been the benefactor of Caddy ’ s life .
“ My Caroline , ” he would say , making the nearest approach that he could to bending over her .
“ Tell me that you are better to-day . ” “ Oh , much better , thank you , Mr. Turveydrop , ” Caddy would reply .
“ <unk> !
<unk> !
And our dear Miss Summerson .
She is not quite <unk> by fatigue ? ” Here he would <unk> up his <unk> and kiss his fingers to me , though I am happy to say he had ceased to be particular in his <unk> since I had been so altered .
“ Not at all , ” I would assure him .
“ <unk> !
We must take care of our dear Caroline , Miss Summerson .
We must spare nothing that will restore her .
We must <unk> her .
My dear Caroline ” — he would turn to his <unk> with infinite generosity and protection — “ want for nothing , my love .
<unk> a wish and <unk> it , my daughter .
Everything this house <unk> , everything my room <unk> , is at your service , my dear .
Do not , ” he would sometimes add in a burst of deportment , “ even allow my simple requirements to be considered if they should at any time <unk> with your own , my Caroline .
Your <unk> are greater than mine . ” He had established such a long <unk> right to this deportment ( his son ’ s inheritance from his mother ) that I several times knew both Caddy and her husband to be melted to tears by these affectionate <unk> .
“ <unk> , my dears , ” he would <unk> ; and when I saw Caddy ’ s thin arm about his fat neck as he said it , I would be melted too , though not by the same process .
“ <unk> , <unk> !
I have promised never to leave ye .
Be dutiful and affectionate towards me , and I ask no other return .
Now , bless ye !
I am going to the <unk> . ” He would take the air there presently and get an appetite for his hotel dinner .
I hope I do old Mr. Turveydrop no wrong , but I never saw any better <unk> in him than these I faithfully <unk> , except that he certainly <unk> a liking for Peepy and would take the child out walking with great <unk> , always on those occasions sending him home before he went to dinner himself , and occasionally with a <unk> in his pocket .
But even this <unk> was attended with no <unk> cost , to my knowledge , for before Peepy was sufficiently <unk> to walk hand in hand with the professor of deportment , he had to be newly dressed , at the expense of Caddy and her husband , from top to <unk> .
<unk> of our visitors , there was Mr. Jellyby .
Really when he used to come in of an evening , and ask Caddy in his meek voice how she was , and then sit down with his head against the wall , and make no attempt to say anything more , I liked him very much .
If he found me <unk> about doing any little thing , he sometimes half took his coat off , as if with an intention of helping by a great exertion ; but he never got any further .
His sole occupation was to sit with his head against the wall , looking hard at the thoughtful baby ; and I could not quite <unk> my mind of a fancy that they understood one another .
I have not counted Mr. Woodcourt among our visitors because he was now Caddy ’ s regular attendant .
She soon began to improve under his care , but he was so gentle , so <unk> , so <unk> in the pains he took that it is not to be wondered at , I am sure .
I saw a good deal of Mr. Woodcourt during this time , though not so much as might be supposed , for knowing Caddy to be safe in his hands , I often slipped home at about the hours when he was expected .
We frequently met , notwithstanding .
I was quite <unk> to myself now , but I still felt glad to think that he was sorry for me , and he still WAS sorry for me I believed .
He helped Mr. Badger in his professional <unk> , which were numerous , and had as yet no settled <unk> for the future .
It was when Caddy began to recover that I began to notice a change in my dear girl .
I cannot say how it first presented itself to me , because I observed it in many slight particulars which were nothing in themselves and only became something when they were <unk> together .
But I made it out , by putting them together , that Ada was not so <unk> cheerful with me as she used to be .
Her tenderness for me was as loving and true as ever ; I did not for a moment doubt that ; but there was a quiet sorrow about her which she did not confide to me , and in which I <unk> some hidden regret .
Now , I could not understand this , and I was so anxious for the happiness of my own pet that it caused me some uneasiness and set me thinking often .
At length , feeling sure that Ada suppressed this something from me lest it should make me unhappy too , it came into my head that she was a little grieved — for me — by what I had told her about Bleak House .
How I persuaded myself that this was likely , I don ’ t know .
I had no idea that there was any selfish reference in my doing so .
I was not grieved for myself : I was quite contented and quite happy .
Still , that Ada might be thinking — for me , though I had abandoned all such thoughts — of what once was , but was now all changed , seemed so easy to believe that I believed it .
What could I do to <unk> my darling ( I considered then ) and show her that I had no such feelings ?
Well !
I could only be as <unk> and busy as possible , and that I had tried to be all along .
However , as Caddy ’ s illness had certainly <unk> , more or less , with my home duties — though I had always been there in the morning to make my guardian ’ s breakfast , and he had a hundred times laughed and said there must be two little women , for his little woman was never <unk> — I resolved to be <unk> diligent and gay .
So I went about the house <unk> all the <unk> I knew , and I sat working and working in a desperate manner , and I talked and talked , morning , noon , and night .
And still there was the same shade between me and my darling .
“ So , Dame Trot , ” observed my guardian , shutting up his book one night when we were all three together , “ so Woodcourt has restored Caddy Jellyby to the full enjoyment of life again ? ” “ Yes , ” I said ; “ and to be <unk> by such gratitude as hers is to be made rich , guardian . ” “ I wish it was , ” he returned , “ with all my heart . ” So did I too , for that matter .
I said so .
“ Aye !
We would make him as rich as a <unk> if we knew how .
Would we not , little woman ? ” I laughed as I worked and replied that I was not sure about that , for it might spoil him , and he might not be so useful , and there might be many who could ill spare him .
As Miss Flite , and Caddy herself , and many others .
“ True , ” said my guardian .
“ I had forgotten that .
But we would agree to make him rich enough to live , I suppose ?
<unk> enough to work with <unk> peace of mind ?
<unk> enough to have his own happy home and his own household <unk> — and household <unk> , too , perhaps ? ” That was quite another thing , I said .
We must all agree in that .
“ To be sure , ” said my guardian .
“ All of us .
I have a great regard for Woodcourt , a high esteem for him ; and I have been sounding him delicately about his plans .
It is difficult to offer aid to an <unk> man with that just kind of pride which he <unk> .
And yet I would be glad to do it if I might or if I knew how .
He seems half inclined for another voyage .
But that appears like casting such a man away . ” “ It might open a new world to him , ” said I.
“ So it might , little woman , ” my guardian assented .
“ I doubt if he <unk> much of the old world .
Do you know I have fancied that he sometimes feels some particular disappointment or misfortune <unk> in it .
You never heard of anything of that sort ? ” I shook my head .
“ <unk> , ” said my guardian .
“ I am mistaken , I dare say . ” As there was a little pause here , which I thought , for my dear girl ’ s satisfaction , had better be filled up , I <unk> an air as I worked which was a favourite with my guardian .
“ And do you think Mr. Woodcourt will make another voyage ? ” I asked him when I had <unk> it quietly all through .
“ I don ’ t quite know what to think , my dear , but I should say it was likely at present that he will give a long <unk> to another country . ” “ I am sure he will take the best wishes of all our hearts with him wherever he goes , ” said I ; “ and though they are not <unk> , he will never be the poorer for them , guardian , at least . ” “ Never , little woman , ” he replied .
I was sitting in my usual place , which was now beside my guardian ’ s chair .
That had not been my usual place before the letter , but it was now .
I looked up to Ada , who was sitting opposite , and I saw , as she looked at me , that her eyes were filled with tears and that tears were falling down her face .
I felt that I had only to be placid and merry once for all to <unk> my dear and set her loving heart at rest .
I really was so , and I had nothing to do but to be myself .
So I made my sweet girl lean upon my shoulder — how little thinking what was heavy on her mind ! — and I said she was not quite well , and put my arm about her , and took her upstairs .
When we were in our own room , and when she might perhaps have told me what I was so unprepared to hear , I gave her no encouragement to confide in me ; I never thought she stood in need of it .
“ Oh , my dear good Esther , ” said Ada , “ if I could only make up my mind to speak to you and my cousin John when you are together ! ” “ Why , my love ! ” I remonstrated .
“ Ada , why should you not speak to us ! ” Ada only dropped her head and pressed me closer to her heart .
“ You surely don ’ t forget , my beauty , ” said I , smiling , “ what quiet , old-fashioned people we are and how I have settled down to be the <unk> of <unk> ?
You don ’ t forget how happily and <unk> my life is all marked out for me , and by whom ?
I am certain that you don ’ t forget by what a noble character , Ada .
That can never be . ” “ No , never , Esther . ” “ Why then , my dear , ” said I , “ there can be nothing <unk> — and why should you not speak to us ? ” “ Nothing <unk> , Esther ? ” returned Ada .
“ Oh , when I think of all these years , and of his fatherly care and kindness , and of the old relations among us , and of you , what shall I do , what shall I do ! ” I looked at my child in some wonder , but I thought it better not to answer otherwise than by <unk> her , and so I turned off into many little <unk> of our life together and prevented her from saying more .
When she lay down to sleep , and not before , I returned to my guardian to say good night , and then I came back to Ada and sat near her for a little while .
She was asleep , and I thought as I looked at her that she was a little changed .
I had thought so more than once lately .
I could not decide , even looking at her while she was unconscious , how she was changed , but something in the familiar beauty of her face looked different to me .
My guardian ’ s old hopes of her and Richard arose <unk> in my mind , and I said to myself , “ She has been anxious about him , ” and I wondered how that love would end .
When I had come home from Caddy ’ s while she was ill , I had often found Ada at work , and she had always put her work away , and I had never known what it was .
Some of it now lay in a drawer near her , which was not quite closed .
I did not open the drawer , but I still rather wondered what the work could be , for it was evidently nothing for herself .
And I noticed as I kissed my dear that she lay with one hand under her pillow so that it was hidden .
How much less amiable I must have been than they thought me , how much less amiable than I thought myself , to be so <unk> with my own cheerfulness and <unk> as to think that it only rested with me to put my dear girl right and set her mind at peace !
But I lay down , <unk> , in that belief .
And I awoke in it next day to find that there was still the same shade between me and my darling .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> When Mr. Woodcourt arrived in London , he went , that very same day , to Mr. Vholes ’ s in Symond ’ s Inn .
For he never once , from the moment when I entreated him to be a friend to Richard , neglected or forgot his promise .
He had told me that he accepted the charge as a sacred trust , and he was ever true to it in that spirit .
He found Mr. Vholes in his office and informed Mr. Vholes of his agreement with Richard that he should call there to learn his address .
“ Just so , sir , ” said Mr. Vholes .
“ Mr.
C. ’ s address is not a hundred miles from here , sir , Mr. C. ’ s address is not a hundred miles from here .
Would you take a seat , sir ? ” Mr. Woodcourt thanked Mr. Vholes , but he had no business with him beyond what he had mentioned .
“ Just so , sir .
I believe , sir , ” said Mr. Vholes , still quietly <unk> on the seat by not giving the address , “ that you have influence with Mr. C. Indeed I am aware that you have . ” “ I was not aware of it myself , ” returned Mr. Woodcourt ; “ but I suppose you know best . ” “ Sir , ” rejoined Mr. Vholes , <unk> as usual , voice and all , “ it is a part of my professional duty to know best .
It is a part of my professional duty to study and to understand a gentleman who <unk> his interests to me .
In my professional duty I shall not be wanting , sir , if I know it .
I may , with the best intentions , be wanting in it without knowing it ; but not if I know it , sir . ” Mr. Woodcourt again mentioned the address .
“ Give me leave , sir , ” said Mr. Vholes .
“ <unk> with me for a moment .
Sir , Mr. C. is playing for a considerable stake , and cannot play without — need I say what ? ” “ <unk> , I presume ? ” “ Sir , ” said Mr. Vholes , “ to be honest with you ( <unk> being my golden <unk> , whether I gain by it or lose , and I find that I generally lose ) , money is the word .
Now , sir , upon the chances of Mr. C. ’ s game I express to you no opinion , NO opinion .
It might be highly <unk> in Mr. C. , after playing so long and so high , to leave off ; it might be the <unk> ; I say nothing .
No , sir , ” said Mr. Vholes , bringing his hand flat down upon his desk in a positive manner , “ nothing . ” “ You seem to forget , ” returned Mr. Woodcourt , “ that I ask you to say nothing and have no interest in anything you say . ” “ Pardon me , sir ! ” retorted Mr. Vholes .
“ You do yourself an injustice .
No , sir !
Pardon me !
You shall not — shall not in my office , if I know it — do yourself an injustice .
You are interested in anything , and in everything , that relates to your friend .
I know human nature much better , sir , than to admit for an instant that a gentleman of your appearance is not interested in whatever concerns his friend . ” “ Well , ” replied Mr. Woodcourt , “ that may be .
I am particularly interested in his address . ” “ The number , sir , ” said Mr. Vholes <unk> , “ I believe I have already mentioned .
If Mr. C. is to continue to play for this considerable stake , sir , he must have funds .
<unk> me !
There are funds in hand at present .
I ask for nothing ; there are funds in hand .
But for the <unk> play , more funds must be provided , unless Mr. C. is to throw away what he has already ventured , which is wholly and <unk> a point for his consideration .
This , sir , I take the opportunity of stating openly to you as the friend of Mr. C. Without funds I shall always be happy to appear and act for Mr. C. to the extent of all such costs as are safe to be allowed out of the estate , not beyond that .
I could not go beyond that , sir , without <unk> some one .
I must either wrong my three dear girls or my venerable father , who is entirely dependent on me , in the Vale of Taunton ; or some one .
Whereas , sir , my resolution is ( call it weakness or folly if you please ) to wrong no one . ” Mr. Woodcourt rather sternly rejoined that he was glad to hear it .
“ I wish , sir , ” said Mr. Vholes , “ to leave a good name behind me .
Therefore I take every opportunity of openly stating to a friend of Mr. C. how Mr. C. is situated .
As to myself , sir , the <unk> is worthy of his <unk> .
If I undertake to put my shoulder to the wheel , I do it , and I <unk> what I get .
I am here for that purpose .
My name is painted on the door outside , with that object . ” “ And Mr. Carstone ’ s address , Mr. Vholes ? ” “ Sir , ” returned Mr. Vholes , “ as I believe I have already mentioned , it is next door .
On the second story you will find Mr. C. ’ s <unk> .
Mr. C. <unk> to be near his professional adviser , and I am far from <unk> , for I court inquiry . ” Upon this Mr. Woodcourt wished Mr. Vholes good day and went in search of Richard , the change in whose appearance he began to understand now but too well .
He found him in a dull room , <unk> furnished , much as I had found him in his <unk> but a little while before , except that he was not writing but was sitting with a book before him , from which his eyes and thoughts were far <unk> .
As the door <unk> to be standing open , Mr. Woodcourt was in his presence for some moments without being perceived , and he told me that he never could forget the <unk> of his face and the <unk> of his manner before he was aroused from his dream .
“ Woodcourt , my dear fellow , ” cried Richard , starting up with extended hands , “ you come upon my <unk> like a ghost . ” “ A friendly one , ” he replied , “ and only waiting , as they say ghosts do , to be addressed .
How does the mortal world go ? ” They were seated now , near together .
“ <unk> enough , and slowly enough , ” said Richard , “ speaking at least for my part of it . ” “ What part is that ? ” “ The Chancery part . ” “ I never heard , ” returned Mr. Woodcourt , shaking his head , “ of its going well yet . ” “ Nor I , ” said Richard moodily .
“ Who ever did ? ” He brightened again in a moment and said with his natural <unk> , “ Woodcourt , I should be sorry to be <unk> by you , even if I gained by it in your <unk> .
You must know that I have done no good this long time .
I have not intended to do much harm , but I seem to have been capable of nothing else .
It may be that I should have done better by keeping out of the <unk> into which my <unk> has worked me , but I think not , though I dare say you will soon hear , if you have not already heard , a very different opinion .
To make short of a long story , I am afraid I have wanted an object ; but I have an object now — or it has me — and it is too late to <unk> it .
Take me as I am , and make the best of me . ” “ A bargain , ” said Mr. Woodcourt .
“ Do as much by me in return . ” “ Oh !
You , ” returned Richard , “ you can pursue your art for its own sake , and can put your hand upon the <unk> and never turn , and can strike a purpose out of anything .
You and I are very different creatures . ” He spoke <unk> and <unk> for a moment into his weary condition .
“ Well , well ! ” he cried , shaking it off .
“ Everything has an end .
We shall see !
So you will take me as I am , and make the best of me ? ” “ Aye !
Indeed I will . ” They shook hands upon it laughingly , but in deep earnestness .
I can answer for one of them with my heart of hearts .
“ You come as a <unk> , ” said Richard , “ for I have seen nobody here yet but Vholes .
Woodcourt , there is one subject I should like to mention , for once and for all , in the beginning of our <unk> .
You can hardly make the best of me if I don ’ t .
You know , I dare say , that I have an attachment to my cousin Ada ? ” Mr. Woodcourt replied that I had hinted as much to him .
“ Now pray , ” returned Richard , “ don ’ t think me a heap of <unk> .
Don ’ t suppose that I am <unk> my head and half breaking my heart over this miserable Chancery suit for my own rights and interests alone .
Ada ’ s are bound up with mine ; they can ’ t be separated ; Vholes works for both of us .
Do think of that ! ” He was so very <unk> on this head that Mr. Woodcourt gave him the strongest assurances that he did him no injustice .
“ You see , ” said Richard , with something <unk> in his manner of lingering on the point , though it was off-hand and <unk> , “ to an upright fellow like you , bringing a friendly face like yours here , I cannot bear the thought of appearing selfish and mean .
I want to see Ada <unk> , Woodcourt , as well as myself ; I want to do my utmost to right her , as well as myself ; I venture what I can scrape together to <unk> her , as well as myself .
Do , I <unk> you , think of that ! ” <unk> , when Mr. Woodcourt came to reflect on what had passed , he was so very much impressed by the strength of Richard ’ s anxiety on this point that in telling me generally of his first visit to Symond ’ s Inn he particularly dwelt upon it .
It revived a fear I had had before that my dear girl ’ s little property would be absorbed by Mr. Vholes and that Richard ’ s <unk> to himself would be sincerely this .
It was just as I began to take care of Caddy that the interview took place , and I now return to the time when Caddy had recovered and the shade was still between me and my darling .
I proposed to Ada that morning that we should go and see Richard .
It a little surprised me to find that she <unk> and was not so <unk> willing as I had expected .
“ My dear , ” said I , “ you have not had any difference with Richard since I have been so much away ? ” “ No , Esther . ” “ Not heard of him , perhaps ? ” said I.
“ Yes , I have heard of him , ” said Ada .
Such tears in her eyes , and such love in her face .
I could not make my darling out .
<unk> I go to Richard ’ s by myself ?
I said .
No , Ada thought I had better not go by myself .
Would she go with me ?
Yes , Ada thought she had better go with me .
<unk> we go now ?
Yes , let us go now .
Well , I could not understand my darling , with the tears in her eyes and the love in her face !
We were soon <unk> and went out .
It was a <unk> day , and drops of <unk> rain fell at intervals .
It was one of those <unk> days when everything looks heavy and <unk> .
The houses <unk> at us , the dust rose at us , the smoke <unk> at us , nothing made any compromise about itself or wore a softened aspect .
I fancied my beautiful girl quite out of place in the <unk> streets , and I thought there were more <unk> passing along the dismal <unk> than I had ever seen before .
We had first to find out Symond ’ s Inn .
We were going to inquire in a shop when Ada said she thought it was near Chancery Lane .
“ We are not likely to be far out , my love , if we go in that direction , ” said I.
So to Chancery Lane we went , and there , sure enough , we saw it written up .
Symond ’ s Inn .
We had next to find out the number .
“ Or Mr. Vholes ’ s office will do , ” I <unk> , “ for Mr. Vholes ’ s office is next door . ” Upon which Ada said , perhaps that was Mr. Vholes ’ s office in the corner there .
And it really was .
Then came the question , which of the two next doors ?
I was going for the one , and my darling was going for the other ; and my darling was right again .
So up we went to the second story , when we came to Richard ’ s name in great white letters on a <unk> <unk> .
I should have knocked , but Ada said perhaps we had better turn the handle and go in .
Thus we came to Richard , <unk> over a table covered with dusty bundles of papers which seemed to me like dusty mirrors <unk> his own mind .
<unk> I looked I saw the <unk> words that ran in it repeated .
Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
He received us very affectionately , and we sat down .
“ If you had come a little earlier , ” he said , “ you would have found Woodcourt here .
There never was such a good fellow as Woodcourt is .
He finds time to look in <unk> , when anybody else with half his work to do would be thinking about not being able to come .
And he is so <unk> , so fresh , so sensible , so earnest , so — everything that I am not , that the place <unk> whenever he comes , and <unk> whenever he goes again . ” “ God bless him , ” I thought , “ for his truth to me ! ” “ He is not so sanguine , Ada , ” continued Richard , casting his dejected look over the bundles of papers , “ as Vholes and I are usually , but he is only an <unk> and is not in the mysteries .
We have gone into them , and he has not .
He can ’ t be expected to know much of such a <unk> . ” As his look wandered over the papers again and he passed his two hands over his head , I noticed how <unk> and how large his eyes appeared , how dry his lips were , and how his <unk> were all <unk> away .
“ Is this a healthy place to live in , Richard , do you think ? ” said I.
“ Why , my dear <unk> , ” answered Richard with his old gay laugh , “ it is neither a <unk> nor a cheerful place ; and when the sun shines here , you may lay a pretty heavy wager that it is shining brightly in an open spot .
But it ’ s well enough for the time .
It ’ s near the offices and near Vholes . ” “ Perhaps , ” I hinted , “ a change from both — ” “ Might do me good ? ” said Richard , <unk> a laugh as he finished the sentence .
“ I shouldn ’ t wonder !
But it can only come in one way now — in one of two ways , I should rather say .
<unk> the suit must be ended , Esther , or the suitor .
But it shall be the suit , my dear girl , the suit , my dear girl ! ” These latter words were addressed to Ada , who was sitting nearest to him .
Her face being turned away from me and towards him , I could not see it .
“ We are doing very well , ” pursued Richard .
“ Vholes will tell you so .
We are really <unk> along .
Ask Vholes .
We are giving them no rest .
Vholes knows all their <unk> and <unk> , and we are upon them everywhere .
We have astonished them already .
We shall <unk> up that <unk> of <unk> , mark my words ! ” His <unk> had long been more painful to me than his <unk> ; it was so unlike <unk> , had something so fierce in its determination to be it , was so hungry and eager , and yet so conscious of being forced and <unk> that it had long touched me to the heart .
But the <unk> upon it now <unk> written in his handsome face made it far more <unk> than it used to be .
I say <unk> , for I felt persuaded that if the fatal cause could have been for ever terminated , according to his brightest <unk> , in that same hour , the traces of the <unk> anxiety , <unk> , and disappointment it had <unk> him would have remained upon his features to the hour of his death .
“ The sight of our dear little woman , ” said Richard , Ada still remaining silent and quiet , “ is so natural to me , and her compassionate face is so like the face of old days — ” Ah !
No , no .
I smiled and shook my head .
“ — So exactly like the face of old days , ” said Richard in his cordial voice , and taking my hand with the brotherly regard which nothing ever changed , “ that I can ’ t make <unk> with her .
I <unk> a little ; that ’ s the truth .
Sometimes I hope , my dear , and sometimes I — don ’ t quite despair , but nearly .
I get , ” said Richard , <unk> my hand gently and walking across the room , “ so tired ! ” He took a few turns up and down and sunk upon the sofa .
“ I get , ” he repeated gloomily , “ so tired .
It is such weary , weary work ! ” He was leaning on his arm saying these words in a <unk> voice and looking at the ground when my darling rose , put off her bonnet , <unk> down beside him with her golden hair falling like sunlight on his head , clasped her two arms round his neck , and turned her face to me .
Oh , what a loving and devoted face I saw !
“ Esther , dear , ” she said very quietly , “ I am not going home again . ” A light shone in upon me all at once .
“ Never any more .
I am going to stay with my dear husband .
We have been married above two months .
Go home without me , my own Esther ; I shall never go home any more ! ” With those words my darling drew his head down on her breast and held it there .
And if ever in my life I saw a love that nothing but death could change , I saw it then before me .
“ Speak to Esther , my dearest , ” said Richard , breaking the silence presently .
“ Tell her how it was . ” I met her before she could come to me and folded her in my arms .
We neither of us spoke , but with her cheek against my own I wanted to hear nothing .
“ My pet , ” said I.
“ My love .
My poor , poor girl ! ” I pitied her so much .
I was very fond of Richard , but the impulse that I had upon me was to pity her so much .
“ Esther , will you forgive me ?
Will my cousin John forgive me ? ” “ My dear , ” said I , “ to doubt it for a moment is to do him a great wrong .
And as to me ! ” Why , as to me , what had I to forgive !
I dried my sobbing darling ’ s eyes and sat beside her on the sofa , and Richard sat on my other side ; and while I was reminded of that so different night when they had first taken me into their confidence and had gone on in their own wild happy way , they told me between them how it was .
“ All I had was Richard ’ s , ” Ada said ; “ and Richard would not take it , Esther , and what could I do but be his wife when I loved him dearly ! ” “ And you were so fully and so kindly occupied , excellent Dame Durden , ” said Richard , “ that how could we speak to you at such a time !
And besides , it was not a <unk> step .
We went out one morning and were married . ” “ And when it was done , Esther , ” said my darling , “ I was always thinking how to tell you and what to do for the best .
And sometimes I thought you ought to know it directly , and sometimes I thought you ought not to know it and keep it from my cousin John ; and I could not tell what to do , and I <unk> very much . ” How selfish I must have been not to have thought of this before !
I don ’ t know what I said now .
I was so sorry , and yet I was so fond of them and so glad that they were fond of me ; I pitied them so much , and yet I felt a kind of pride in their loving one another .
I never had experienced such painful and <unk> emotion at one time , and in my own heart I did not know which <unk> .
But I was not there to <unk> their way ; I did not do that .
When I was less foolish and more composed , my darling took her <unk> from her bosom , and kissed it , and put it on .
Then I remembered last night and told Richard that ever since her marriage she had worn it at night when there was no one to see .
Then Ada <unk> asked me how did I know that , my dear .
Then I told Ada how I had seen her hand <unk> under her pillow and had little thought why , my dear .
Then they began telling me how it was all over again , and I began to be sorry and glad again , and foolish again , and to hide my plain old face as much as I could lest I should put them out of heart .
Thus the time went on until it became necessary for me to think of returning .
When that time arrived it was the worst of all , for then my darling completely broke down .
She clung round my neck , calling me by every dear name she could think of and saying what should she do without me !
Nor was Richard much better ; and as for me , I should have been the worst of the three if I had not severely said to myself , “ Now Esther , if you do , I ’ ll never speak to you again ! ” “ Why , I declare , ” said I , “ I never saw such a wife .
I don ’ t think she loves her husband at all .
Here , Richard , take my child , for goodness ’ sake . ” But I held her tight all the while , and could have wept over her I don ’ t know how long .
“ I give this dear young couple notice , ” said I , “ that I am only going away to come back to-morrow and that I shall be always coming <unk> and <unk> until Symond ’ s Inn is tired of the sight of me .
So I shall not say good-bye , Richard .
For what would be the use of that , you know , when I am coming back so soon ! ” I had given my darling to him now , and I meant to go ; but I <unk> for one more look of the precious face which it seemed to <unk> my heart to turn from .
So I said ( in a merry <unk> manner ) that unless they gave me some encouragement to come back , I was not sure that I could take that liberty , upon which my dear girl looked up , faintly smiling through her tears , and I folded her lovely face between my hands , and gave it one last kiss , and laughed , and ran away .
And when I got downstairs , oh , how I cried !
It almost seemed to me that I had lost my Ada for ever .
I was so lonely and so blank without her , and it was so desolate to be going home with no hope of seeing her there , that I could get no comfort for a little while as I walked up and down in a dim corner sobbing and crying .
I came to myself by and by , after a little <unk> , and took a coach home .
The poor boy whom I had found at St. Albans had <unk> a short time before and was lying at the point of death ; indeed , was then dead , though I did not know it .
My guardian had gone out to inquire about him and did not return to dinner .
Being quite alone , I cried a little again , though on the whole I don ’ t think I <unk> so very , very ill .
It was only natural that I should not be quite accustomed to the loss of my darling yet .
Three or four hours were not a long time after years .
But my mind dwelt so much upon the <unk> scene in which I had left her , and I <unk> it as such an <unk> <unk> one , and I so longed to be near her and taking some sort of care of her , that I determined to go back in the evening only to look up at her windows .
It was foolish , I dare say , but it did not then seem at all so to me , and it does not seem quite so even now .
I took Charley into my confidence , and we went out at dusk .
It was dark when we came to the new strange home of my dear girl , and there was a light behind the yellow <unk> .
We walked past <unk> three or four times , looking up , and <unk> missed <unk> Mr. Vholes , who came out of his office while we were there and turned his head to look up too before going home .
The sight of his <unk> black figure and the <unk> air of that <unk> in the dark were favourable to the state of my mind .
I thought of the youth and love and beauty of my dear girl , shut up in such an <unk> refuge , almost as if it were a cruel place .
It was very solitary and very dull , and I did not doubt that I might safely steal upstairs .
I left Charley below and went up with a light foot , not distressed by any glare from the feeble oil <unk> on the way .
I listened for a few moments , and in the <unk> <unk> silence of the house believed that I could hear the murmur of their young voices .
I put my lips to the <unk> <unk> of the door as a kiss for my dear and came quietly down again , thinking that one of these days I would confess to the visit .
And it really did me good , for though nobody but Charley and I knew anything about it , I somehow felt as if it had <unk> the separation between Ada and me and had brought us together again for those moments .
I went back , not quite accustomed yet to the change , but all the better for that hovering about my darling .
My guardian had come home and was standing thoughtfully by the dark window .
When I went in , his face cleared and he came to his seat , but he caught the light upon my face as I took mine .
“ Little woman , ” said he , “ You have been crying . ” “ Why , yes , guardian , ” said I , “ I am afraid I have been , a little .
Ada has been in such distress , and is so very sorry , guardian . ” I put my arm on the back of his chair , and I saw in his glance that my words and my look at her empty place had prepared him .
“ Is she married , my dear ? ” I told him all about it and how her first entreaties had referred to his forgiveness .
“ She has no need of it , ” said he .
“ Heaven bless her and her husband ! ” But just as my first impulse had been to pity her , so was his .
“ Poor girl , poor girl !
Poor Rick !
Poor Ada ! ” Neither of us spoke after that , until he said with a sigh , “ Well , well , my dear !
Bleak House is <unk> fast . ” “ But its mistress remains , guardian . ” Though I was timid about saying it , I ventured because of the sorrowful tone in which he had spoken .
“ She will do all she can to make it happy , ” said I.
“ She will succeed , my love ! ” The letter had made no difference between us except that the seat by his side had come to be mine ; it made none now .
He turned his old bright fatherly look upon me , laid his hand on my hand in his old way , and said again , “ She will succeed , my dear .
Nevertheless , Bleak House is <unk> fast , O little woman ! ” I was sorry presently that this was all we said about that .
I was rather disappointed .
I feared I might not quite have been all I had meant to be since the letter and the answer .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> But one other day had <unk> when , early in the morning as we were going to breakfast , Mr. Woodcourt came in haste with the <unk> news that a terrible murder had been committed for which Mr. George had been <unk> and was in custody .
When he told us that a large reward was offered by Sir Leicester Dedlock for the <unk> ’ s apprehension , I did not in my first <unk> understand why ; but a few more words explained to me that the murdered person was Sir Leicester ’ s lawyer , and immediately my mother ’ s dread of him <unk> into my remembrance .
This <unk> and violent removal of one whom she had long watched and <unk> and who had long watched and <unk> her , one for whom she could have had few intervals of kindness , always <unk> in him a dangerous and secret enemy , appeared so awful that my first thoughts were of her .
How <unk> to hear of such a death and be able to feel no pity !
How dreadful to remember , perhaps , that she had sometimes even wished the old man away who was so swiftly hurried out of life !
Such <unk> <unk> , increasing the distress and fear I always felt when the name was mentioned , made me so <unk> that I could scarcely hold my place at the table .
I was quite unable to follow the conversation until I had had a little time to recover .
But when I came to myself and saw how shocked my guardian was and found that they were earnestly speaking of the suspected man and <unk> every favourable impression we had formed of him out of the good we had known of him , my interest and my fears were so strongly aroused in his behalf that I was quite set up again .
“ Guardian , you don ’ t think it possible that he is justly accused ? ” “ My dear , I CAN ’ T think so .
This man whom we have seen so <unk> and compassionate , who with the might of a giant has the gentleness of a child , who looks as brave a fellow as ever lived and is so simple and quiet with it , this man justly accused of such a crime ?
I can ’ t believe it .
It ’ s not that I don ’ t or I won ’ t .
I can ’ t ! ” “ And I can ’ t , ” said Mr. Woodcourt .
“ Still , whatever we believe or know of him , we had better not forget that some appearances are against him .
He bore an <unk> towards the deceased gentleman .
He has openly mentioned it in many places .
He is said to have expressed himself violently towards him , and he certainly did about him , to my knowledge .
He admits that he was alone on the scene of the murder within a few minutes of its commission .
I sincerely believe him to be as innocent of any <unk> in it as I am , but these are all reasons for suspicion falling upon him . ” “ True , ” said my guardian .
And he added , turning to me , “ It would be doing him a very bad service , my dear , to shut our eyes to the truth in any of these respects . ” I felt , of course , that we must admit , not only to ourselves but to others , the full force of the circumstances against him .
Yet I knew <unk> ( I could not help saying ) that their weight would not induce us to desert him in his need .
“ Heaven forbid ! ” returned my guardian .
“ We will stand by him , as he himself stood by the two poor creatures who are gone . ” He meant Mr. Gridley and the boy , to both of whom Mr. George had given shelter .
Mr. Woodcourt then told us that the trooper ’ s man had been with him before day , after wandering about the streets all night like a <unk> creature .
That one of the trooper ’ s first <unk> was that we should not suppose him guilty .
That he had charged his messenger to represent his perfect innocence with every solemn assurance he could send us .
That Mr. Woodcourt had only <unk> the man by undertaking to come to our house very early in the morning with these <unk> .
He added that he was now upon his way to see the prisoner himself .
My guardian said directly he would go too .
Now , besides that I liked the retired soldier very much and that he liked me , I had that secret interest in what had happened which was only known to my guardian .
I felt as if it came close and near to me .
It seemed to become personally important to myself that the truth should be discovered and that no innocent people should be suspected , for suspicion , once run wild , might run <unk> .
In a word , I felt as if it were my duty and obligation to go with them .
My guardian did not seek to <unk> me , and I went .
It was a large prison with many courts and passages so like one another and so <unk> <unk> that I seemed to gain a new comprehension , as I passed along , of the <unk> that solitary <unk> , shut up among the same staring walls from year to year , have had — as I have read — for a <unk> or a stray <unk> of grass .
In an arched room by himself , like a cellar upstairs , with walls so <unk> white that they made the massive iron <unk> and <unk> door even more profoundly black than they were , we found the trooper standing in a corner .
He had been sitting on a bench there and had risen when he heard the locks and <unk> turn .
When he saw us , he came forward a step with his usual heavy tread , and there stopped and made a slight bow .
But as I still advanced , putting out my hand to him , he understood us in a moment .
“ This is a load off my mind , I do assure you , miss and gentlemen , ” said he , <unk> us with great <unk> and drawing a long breath .
“ And now I don ’ t so much care how it ends . ” He scarcely seemed to be the prisoner .
What with his coolness and his soldierly bearing , he looked far more like the prison guard .
“ This is even a <unk> place than my gallery to receive a lady in , ” said Mr. George , “ but I know Miss Summerson will make the best of it . ” As he handed me to the bench on which he had been sitting , I sat down , which seemed to give him great satisfaction .
“ I thank you , miss , ” said he .
“ Now , George , ” observed my guardian , “ as we require no new assurances on your part , so I believe we need give you none on ours . ” “ Not at all , sir .
I thank you with all my heart .
If I was not innocent of this crime , I couldn ’ t look at you and keep my secret to myself under the condescension of the present visit .
I feel the present visit very much .
I am not one of the eloquent sort , but I feel it , Miss Summerson and gentlemen , deeply . ” He laid his hand for a moment on his broad chest and bent his head to us .
Although he squared himself again directly , he expressed a great amount of natural emotion by these simple means .
“ First , ” said my guardian , “ can we do anything for your personal comfort , George ? ” “ For which , sir ? ” he inquired , <unk> his throat .
“ For your personal comfort .
Is there anything you want that would <unk> the <unk> of this <unk> ? ” “ Well , sir , ” replied George , after a little <unk> , “ I am equally obliged to you , but tobacco being against the <unk> , I can ’ t say that there is . ” “ You will think of many little things perhaps , by and by .
Whenever you do , George , let us know . ” “ Thank you , sir .
<unk> , ” observed Mr. George with one of his sunburnt smiles , “ a man who has been knocking about the world in a vagabond kind of a way as long as I have gets on well enough in a place like the present , so far as that goes . ” “ Next , as to your case , ” observed my guardian .
“ <unk> so , sir , ” returned Mr. George , folding his arms upon his breast with perfect <unk> and a little curiosity .
“ How does it stand now ? ” “ Why , sir , it is under <unk> at present .
Bucket gives me to understand that he will probably apply for a series of <unk> from time to time until the case is more complete .
How it is to be made more complete I don ’ t myself see , but I dare say Bucket will manage it somehow . ” “ Why , heaven save us , man , ” exclaimed my guardian , surprised into his old <unk> and vehemence , “ you talk of yourself as if you were somebody else ! ” “ No offence , sir , ” said Mr. George .
“ I am very sensible of your kindness .
But I don ’ t see how an innocent man is to make up his mind to this kind of thing without knocking his head against the walls unless he takes it in that point of view . ” “ That is true enough to a certain extent , ” returned my guardian , softened .
“ But my good fellow , even an innocent man must take ordinary precautions to defend himself . ” “ Certainly , sir .
And I have done so .
I have stated to the <unk> , ‘ Gentlemen , I am as innocent of this charge as yourselves ; what has been stated against me in the way of facts is perfectly true ; I know no more about it . ’ I intend to continue stating that , sir .
What more can I do ?
It ’ s the truth . ” “ But the mere truth won ’ t do , ” rejoined my guardian .
“ <unk> ’ t it indeed , sir ?
<unk> a bad <unk> for me ! ” Mr. George good-humouredly observed .
“ You must have a lawyer , ” pursued my guardian .
“ We must engage a good one for you . ” “ I ask your pardon , sir , ” said Mr. George with a step backward .
“ I am equally obliged .
But I must decidedly beg to be <unk> from anything of that sort . ” “ You won ’ t have a lawyer ? ” “ No , sir . ” Mr. George shook his head in the most emphatic manner .
“ I thank you all the same , sir , but — no lawyer ! ” “ Why not ? ” “ I don ’ t take kindly to the breed , ” said Mr. George .
“ Gridley didn ’ t .
And — if you ’ ll excuse my saying so much — I should hardly have thought you did yourself , sir . ” “ That ’ s equity , ” my guardian explained , a little at a loss ; “ that ’ s equity , George . ” “ Is it , indeed , sir ? ” returned the trooper in his off-hand manner .
“ I am not acquainted with those shades of names myself , but in a general way I object to the breed . ” <unk> his arms and changing his position , he stood with one massive hand upon the table and the other on his <unk> , as complete a picture of a man who was not to be moved from a fixed purpose as ever I saw .
It was in vain that we all three talked to him and <unk> to persuade him ; he listened with that gentleness which went so well with his <unk> bearing , but was evidently no more shaken by our <unk> that his place of <unk> was .
“ Pray think , once more , Mr. George , ” said I.
“ Have you no wish in reference to your case ? ” “ I certainly could wish it to be tried , miss , ” he returned , “ by <unk> ; but that is out of the question , as I am well aware .
If you will be so good as to favour me with your attention for a couple of minutes , miss , not more , I ’ ll endeavour to explain myself as clearly as I can . ” He looked at us all three in turn , shook his head a little as if he were adjusting it in the stock and collar of a tight uniform , and after a moment ’ s reflection went on .
“ You see , miss , I have been <unk> and taken into custody and brought here .
I am a marked and <unk> man , and here I am .
My shooting gallery is <unk> , high and low , by Bucket ; such property as I have — ’ <unk> small — is turned this way and that till it don ’ t know itself ; and ( as aforesaid ) here I am !
I don ’ t particular complain of that .
Though I am in these present quarters through no immediately <unk> fault of mine , I can very well understand that if I hadn ’ t gone into the vagabond way in my youth , this wouldn ’ t have happened .
It <unk> happened .
Then comes the question how to meet it . ” He rubbed his <unk> forehead for a moment with a good-humoured look and said <unk> , “ I am such a <unk> <unk> that I must think a bit . ” Having thought a bit , he looked up again and resumed .
“ How to meet it .
Now , the unfortunate deceased was himself a lawyer and had a pretty tight hold of me .
I don ’ t wish to <unk> up his ashes , but he had , what I should call if he was living , a devil of a tight hold of me .
I don ’ t like his trade the better for that .
If I had kept clear of his trade , I should have kept outside this place .
But that ’ s not what I mean .
Now , suppose I had killed him .
Suppose I really had discharged into his body any one of those <unk> recently <unk> off that Bucket has found at my place , and dear me , might have found there any day since it has been my place .
What should I have done as soon as I was hard and fast here ?
<unk> a lawyer . ” He stopped on hearing some one at the locks and <unk> and did not resume until the door had been opened and was shut again .
For what purpose opened , I will mention presently .
“ I should have got a lawyer , and he would have said ( as I have often read in the newspapers ) , ‘ My client says nothing , my client <unk> his <unk> ’ : my client this , that , and t ’ other .
Well , ’ <unk> not the custom of that breed to go straight , according to my opinion , or to think that other men do .
Say I am innocent and I get a lawyer .
He would be as likely to believe me guilty as not ; perhaps more .
What would he do , whether or not ?
<unk> as if I was — shut my mouth up , tell me not to commit myself , keep circumstances back , <unk> the evidence small , <unk> , and get me off perhaps !
But , Miss Summerson , do I care for getting off in that way ; or would I rather be hanged in my own way — if you ’ ll excuse my mentioning anything so disagreeable to a lady ? ” He had warmed into his subject now , and was under no further necessity to wait a bit .
“ I would rather be hanged in my own way .
And I mean to be !
I don ’ t intend to say , ” looking round upon us with his powerful arms <unk> and his dark eyebrows raised , “ that I am more partial to being hanged than another man .
What I say is , I must come off clear and full or not at all .
Therefore , when I hear stated against me what is true , I say it ’ s true ; and when they tell me , ‘ whatever you say will be used , ’ I tell them I don ’ t mind that ; I mean it to be used .
If they can ’ t make me innocent out of the whole truth , they are not likely to do it out of anything less , or anything else .
And if they are , it ’ s worth nothing to me . ” <unk> a pace or two over the stone floor , he came back to the table and finished what he had to say .
“ I thank you , miss and gentlemen both , many times for your attention , and many times more for your interest .
That ’ s the plain state of the matter as it points itself out to a mere trooper with a <unk> broadsword kind of a mind .
I have never done well in life beyond my duty as a soldier , and if the worst comes after all , I shall <unk> pretty much as I have <unk> .
When I got over the first crash of being seized as a <unk> — it don ’ t take a <unk> who has knocked about so much as myself so very long to recover from a crash — I worked my way round to what you find me now .
As such I shall remain .
No relations will be <unk> by me or made unhappy for me , and — and that ’ s all I ’ ve got to say . ” The door had been opened to admit another <unk> man of less prepossessing appearance at first sight and a <unk> , bright-eyed wholesome woman with a basket , who , from her entrance , had been exceedingly attentive to all Mr. George had said .
Mr. George had received them with a familiar nod and a friendly look , but without any more particular <unk> in the midst of his address .
He now shook them <unk> by the hand and said , “ Miss Summerson and gentlemen , this is an old comrade of mine , Matthew Bagnet .
And this is his wife , Mrs. Bagnet . ” Mr. Bagnet made us a stiff military bow , and Mrs. Bagnet dropped us a curtsy .
“ <unk> good friends of mine , they are , ” <unk> Mr. George .
“ It was at their house I was taken . ” “ With a second-hand wiolinceller , ” Mr. Bagnet put in , <unk> his head angrily .
“ Of a good tone .
For a friend .
That money was no object to . ” “ Mat , ” said Mr. George , “ you have heard pretty well all I have been saying to this lady and these two gentlemen .
I know it meets your approval ? ” Mr. Bagnet , after considering , referred the point to his wife .
“ Old girl , ” said he .
“ Tell him .
Whether or not .
It meets my approval . ” “ Why , George , ” exclaimed Mrs. Bagnet , who had been <unk> her basket , in which there was a piece of cold <unk> pork , a little tea and <unk> , and a brown <unk> , “ you ought to know it don ’ t .
You ought to know it ’ s enough to drive a person wild to hear you .
You won ’ t be got off this way , and you won ’ t be got off that way — what do you mean by such <unk> and <unk> ?
It ’ s stuff and nonsense , George . ” “ Don ’ t be severe upon me in my <unk> , Mrs. Bagnet , ” said the trooper lightly .
“ Oh !
<unk> your <unk> , ” cried Mrs. Bagnet , “ if they don ’ t make you more reasonable than that comes to .
I never was so ashamed in my life to hear a man talk folly as I have been to hear you talk this day to the present company .
<unk> ?
Why , what but too many <unk> should <unk> you from having a dozen lawyers if the gentleman <unk> them to you . ” “ This is a very sensible woman , ” said my guardian .
“ I hope you will persuade him , Mrs. Bagnet . ” “ <unk> him , sir ? ” she returned .
“ Lord bless you , no .
You don ’ t know George .
Now , there ! ” Mrs. Bagnet left her basket to point him out with both her bare brown hands .
“ There he stands !
As <unk> and as determined a man , in the wrong way , as ever put a human creature under heaven out of patience !
You could as soon take up and shoulder an eight and forty <unk> by your own strength as turn that man when he has got a thing into his head and fixed it there .
Why , don ’ t I know him ! ” cried Mrs. Bagnet .
“ Don ’ t I know you , George !
You don ’ t mean to set up for a new character with ME after all these years , I hope ? ” Her friendly indignation had an exemplary effect upon her husband , who shook his head at the trooper several times as a silent <unk> to him to yield .
Between <unk> , Mrs. Bagnet looked at me ; and I understood from the play of her eyes that she wished me to do something , though I did not comprehend what .
“ But I have given up talking to you , old fellow , years and years , ” said Mrs. Bagnet as she blew a little dust off the <unk> pork , looking at me again ; “ and when ladies and gentlemen know you as well as I do , they ’ ll give up talking to you too .
If you are not too <unk> to accept of a bit of dinner , here it is . ” “ I accept it with many thanks , ” returned the trooper .
“ Do you though , indeed ? ” said Mrs. Bagnet , <unk> to <unk> on good-humouredly .
“ I ’ m sure I ’ m surprised at that .
I wonder you don ’ t <unk> in your own way also .
It would only be like you .
Perhaps you ’ ll set your mind upon THAT next . ” Here she again looked at me , and I now perceived from her glances at the door and at me , by turns , that she wished us to retire and to <unk> her following us outside the prison .
<unk> this by similar means to my guardian and Mr. Woodcourt , I rose .
“ We hope you will think better of it , Mr. George , ” said I , “ and we shall come to see you again , trusting to find you more reasonable . ” “ More grateful , Miss Summerson , you can ’ t find me , ” he returned .
“ But more <unk> we can , I hope , ” said I.
“ And let me entreat you to consider that the <unk> up of this mystery and the discovery of the real <unk> of this deed may be of the last importance to others besides yourself . ” He heard me respectfully but without much <unk> these words , which I spoke a little turned from him , already on my way to the door ; he was observing ( this they afterwards told me ) my height and figure , which seemed to catch his attention all at once .
“ ’ Tis curious , ” said he .
“ And yet I thought so at the time ! ” My guardian asked him what he meant .
“ Why , sir , ” he answered , “ when my ill fortune took me to the dead man ’ s staircase on the night of his murder , I saw a shape so like Miss Summerson ’ s go by me in the dark that I had half a mind to speak to it . ” For an instant I felt such a shudder as I never felt before or since and hope I shall never feel again .
“ It came downstairs as I went up , ” said the trooper , “ and crossed the <unk> window with a loose black <unk> on ; I noticed a deep <unk> to it .
However , it has nothing to do with the present subject , excepting that Miss Summerson looked so like it at the moment that it came into my head . ” I cannot separate and <unk> the feelings that arose in me after this ; it is enough that the vague duty and obligation I had felt upon me from the first of following the <unk> was , without my distinctly <unk> to ask myself any question , increased , and that I was indignantly sure of there being no possibility of a reason for my being afraid .
We three went out of the prison and walked up and down at some short distance from the gate , which was in a retired place .
We had not waited long when Mr. and Mrs. Bagnet came out too and quickly joined us .
There was a tear in each of Mrs. Bagnet ’ s eyes , and her face was flushed and hurried .
“ I didn ’ t let George see what I thought about it , you know , miss , ” was her first remark when she came up , “ but he ’ s in a bad way , poor old fellow ! ” “ Not with care and <unk> and good help , ” said my guardian .
“ A gentleman like you ought to know best , sir , ” returned Mrs. Bagnet , hurriedly drying her eyes on the <unk> of her grey cloak , “ but I am uneasy for him .
He has been so careless and said so much that he never meant .
The gentlemen of the <unk> might not understand him as Lignum and me do .
And then such a number of circumstances have happened bad for him , and such a number of people will be brought forward to speak against him , and Bucket is so deep . ” “ With a second-hand wiolinceller .
And said he played the fife .
When a boy , ” Mr. Bagnet added with great <unk> .
“ Now , I tell you , miss , ” said Mrs. Bagnet ; “ and when I say miss , I mean all !
Just come into the corner of the wall and I ’ ll tell you ! ” Mrs. Bagnet hurried us into a more <unk> place and was at first too breathless to proceed , <unk> Mr. Bagnet to say , “ Old girl !
Tell ’ em ! ” “ Why , then , miss , ” the old girl proceeded , <unk> the strings of her bonnet for more air , “ you could as soon move <unk> <unk> as move George on this point unless you had got a new power to move him with .
And I have got it ! ” “ You are a jewel of a woman , ” said my guardian .
“ Go on ! ” “ Now , I tell you , miss , ” she proceeded , clapping her hands in her hurry and agitation a dozen times in every sentence , “ that what he says concerning no relations is all <unk> .
They don ’ t know of him , but he does know of them .
He has said more to me at odd times than to anybody else , and it warn ’ t for nothing that he once spoke to my Woolwich about <unk> and <unk> mothers ’ heads .
For fifty pounds he had seen his mother that day .
She ’ s alive and must be brought here straight ! ” <unk> Mrs. Bagnet put some <unk> into her mouth and began <unk> up her skirts all round a little higher than the level of her grey cloak , which she accomplished with <unk> dispatch and <unk> .
“ Lignum , ” said Mrs. Bagnet , “ you take care of the children , old man , and give me the umbrella !
I ’ m away to Lincolnshire to bring that old lady here . ” “ But , bless the woman , ” cried my guardian with his hand in his pocket , “ how is she going ?
What money has she got ? ” Mrs. Bagnet made another application to her skirts and brought forth a <unk> purse in which she hastily counted over a few shillings and which she then shut up with perfect satisfaction .
“ Never you mind for me , miss .
I ’ m a soldier ’ s wife and accustomed to travel my own way .
Lignum , old boy , ” kissing him , “ one for yourself , three for the children .
Now I ’ m away into Lincolnshire after George ’ s mother ! ” And she actually set off while we three stood looking at one another lost in amazement .
She actually <unk> away in her grey cloak at a <unk> pace , and turned the corner , and was gone .
“ Mr.
Bagnet , ” said my guardian .
“ Do you mean to let her go in that way ? ” “ Can ’ t help it , ” he returned .
“ <unk> her way home once from another quarter of the world .
With the same grey cloak .
And same umbrella .
Whatever the old girl says , do .
Do it !
Whenever the old girl says , I ’ <unk> do it .
She does it . ” “ Then she is as honest and genuine as she looks , ” rejoined my guardian , “ and it is impossible to say more for her . ” “ She ’ s <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , ” said Mr. Bagnet , looking at us over his shoulder as he went his way also .
“ And there ’ s not such another .
But I never own to it before her .
Discipline must be maintained . ” CHAPTER <unk> The <unk> Mr. Bucket and his fat forefinger are much in <unk> together under <unk> circumstances .
When Mr. Bucket has a matter of this pressing interest under his consideration , the fat forefinger seems to rise , to the dignity of a familiar demon .
He puts it to his ears , and it whispers information ; he puts it to his lips , and it <unk> him to secrecy ; he rubs it over his nose , and it <unk> his <unk> ; he shakes it before a guilty man , and it charms him to his <unk> .
The <unk> of the Detective Temple invariably <unk> that when Mr. Bucket and that finger are in much conference , a terrible <unk> will be heard of before long .
<unk> mildly <unk> in his observation of human nature , on the whole a benignant <unk> not disposed to be severe upon the <unk> of mankind , Mr. Bucket <unk> a vast number of houses and <unk> about an <unk> of streets , to outward appearance rather <unk> for want of an object .
He is in the <unk> condition towards his species and will drink with most of them .
He is free with his money , affable in his manners , innocent in his conversation — but through the placid stream of his life there glides an <unk> of forefinger .
Time and place cannot <unk> Mr. Bucket .
Like man in the <unk> , he is here to-day and gone to-morrow — but , very unlike man indeed , he is here again the next day .
This evening he will be casually looking into the iron <unk> at the door of Sir Leicester Dedlock ’ s house in town ; and to-morrow morning he will be walking on the leads at Chesney Wold , where <unk> the old man walked whose ghost is <unk> with a hundred guineas .
<unk> , <unk> , pockets , all things belonging to him , Mr. Bucket examines .
A few hours afterwards , he and the Roman will be alone together <unk> <unk> .
It is likely that these <unk> are <unk> with home enjoyment , but it is certain that Mr. Bucket at present does not go home .
Though in general he highly <unk> the society of Mrs. Bucket — a lady of a natural <unk> <unk> , which if it had been improved by professional exercise , might have done great things , but which has <unk> at the level of a clever amateur — he holds himself <unk> from that dear <unk> .
Mrs. Bucket is dependent on their lodger ( <unk> an amiable lady in whom she takes an interest ) for <unk> and conversation .
A great crowd <unk> in Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields on the day of the funeral .
Sir Leicester Dedlock <unk> the ceremony in person ; strictly speaking , there are only three other human followers , that is to say , Lord Doodle , William Buffy , and the debilitated cousin ( thrown in as a <unk> ) , but the amount of <unk> carriages is immense .
The peerage <unk> more <unk> affliction than has ever been seen in that neighbourhood .
Such is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on coach <unk> that the <unk> ’ s <unk> might be supposed to have lost its father and mother at a blow .
The <unk> of <unk> sends a <unk> pile of dust and ashes , with silver <unk> , <unk> <unk> , all the last <unk> , and three <unk> <unk> , six feet high , holding on behind , in a bunch of <unk> .
All the state <unk> in London seem <unk> into mourning ; and if that dead old man of the rusty <unk> be not beyond a taste in <unk> ( which appears impossible ) , it must be highly gratified this day .
<unk> among the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of so many legs all <unk> in grief , Mr. Bucket sits <unk> in one of the <unk> carriages and at his ease <unk> the crowd through the <unk> <unk> .
He has a keen eye for a crowd — as for what not ? — and looking here and there , now from this side of the carriage , now from the other , now up at the house windows , now along the people ’ s heads , nothing <unk> him .
“ And there you are , my partner , eh ? ” says Mr. Bucket to himself , <unk> Mrs. Bucket , <unk> , by his favour , on the steps of the deceased ’ s house .
“ And so you are .
And so you are !
And very well indeed you are looking , Mrs. Bucket ! ” The procession has not started yet , but is waiting for the cause of its <unk> to be brought out .
Mr. Bucket , in the foremost <unk> carriage , uses his two fat <unk> to hold the <unk> a hair ’ s breadth open while he looks .
And it says a great deal for his attachment , as a husband , that he is still occupied with Mrs. <unk>
“ There you are , my partner , eh ? ” he <unk> repeats .
“ And our lodger with you .
I ’ m taking notice of you , Mrs. Bucket ; I hope you ’ re all right in your health , my dear ! ” Not another word does Mr. Bucket say , but sits with most attentive eyes until the <unk> <unk> of noble secrets is brought down — Where are all those secrets now ?
Does he keep them yet ?
Did they fly with him on that sudden journey ? — and until the procession moves , and Mr. Bucket ’ s view is changed .
After which he <unk> himself for an easy ride and takes note of the <unk> of the carriage in case he should ever find such knowledge useful .
<unk> enough between Mr. Tulkinghorn shut up in his dark carriage and Mr. Bucket shut up in HIS .
Between the <unk> track of space beyond the little wound that has thrown the one into the fixed sleep which <unk> so heavily over the stones of the streets , and the narrow track of blood which keeps the other in the watchful state expressed in every hair of his head !
But it is all one to both ; neither is troubled about that .
Mr. Bucket sits out the procession in his own easy manner and glides from the carriage when the opportunity he has settled with himself arrives .
He makes for Sir Leicester Dedlock ’ s , which is at present a sort of home to him , where he comes and goes as he likes at all hours , where he is always welcome and made much of , where he knows the whole establishment , and walks in an atmosphere of mysterious greatness .
No knocking or ringing for Mr. Bucket .
He has caused himself to be provided with a key and can pass in at his pleasure .
As he is crossing the hall , Mercury informs him , “ Here ’ s another letter for you , Mr. Bucket , come by post , ” and gives it him .
“ Another one , eh ? ” says Mr. Bucket .
If Mercury should chance to be possessed by any lingering curiosity as to Mr. Bucket ’ s letters , that <unk> person is not the man to <unk> it .
Mr. Bucket looks at him as if his face were a <unk> of some miles in length and he were leisurely contemplating the same .
“ Do you happen to carry a box ? ” says Mr. Bucket .
<unk> Mercury is no <unk> .
“ Could you fetch me a pinch from <unk> ? ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Thankee .
It don ’ t matter what it is ; I ’ m not particular as to the kind .
Thankee ! ” Having leisurely helped himself from a <unk> borrowed from somebody downstairs for the purpose , and having made a considerable show of <unk> it , first with one side of his nose and then with the other , Mr. Bucket , with much <unk> , <unk> it of the right sort and goes on , letter in hand .
Now although Mr. Bucket walks upstairs to the little library within the larger one with the face of a man who receives some scores of letters every day , it happens that much correspondence is not <unk> to his life .
He is no great <unk> , rather <unk> his pen like the <unk> he carries about with him always convenient to his <unk> , and <unk> correspondence with himself in others as being too <unk> and direct a way of doing delicate business .
<unk> , he often sees <unk> letters produced in evidence and has occasion to reflect that it was a green thing to write them .
For these reasons he has very little to do with letters , either as <unk> or <unk> .
And yet he has received a round <unk> within the last <unk> hours .
“ And this , ” says Mr. Bucket , <unk> it out on the table , “ is in the same hand , and <unk> of the same two words . ” What two words ?
He turns the key in the door , <unk> his black <unk> ( book of fate to many ) , lays another letter by it , and reads , <unk> written in each , “ Lady Dedlock . ” “ Yes , yes , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ But I could have made the money without this <unk> information . ” Having put the letters in his book of fate and <unk> it up again , he unlocks the door just in time to admit his dinner , which is brought upon a goodly tray with a <unk> of <unk> .
Mr. Bucket frequently observes , in friendly circles where there is no <unk> , that he likes a <unk> of your fine old brown <unk> <unk> <unk> better than anything you can offer him .
Consequently he fills and <unk> his glass with a <unk> of his lips and is proceeding with his refreshment when an idea enters his mind .
Mr. Bucket softly opens the door of communication between that room and the next and looks in .
The library is deserted , and the fire is sinking low .
Mr. Bucket ’ s eye , after taking a <unk> round the room , alights upon a table where letters are usually put as they <unk> .
Several letters for Sir Leicester are upon it .
Mr. Bucket draws near and examines the directions .
“ No , ” he says , “ there ’ s none in that hand .
It ’ s only me as is written to .
I can break it to Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , to-morrow . ” With that he returns to finish his dinner with a good appetite , and after a light <unk> , is <unk> into the drawing-room .
Sir Leicester has received him there these several evenings past to know whether he has anything to report .
The debilitated cousin ( much exhausted by the funeral ) and Volumnia are in attendance .
Mr. Bucket makes three distinctly different bows to these three people .
A bow of homage to Sir Leicester , a bow of gallantry to Volumnia , and a bow of recognition to the debilitated Cousin , to whom it <unk> says , “ You are a swell about town , and you know me , and I know you . ” Having distributed these little specimens of his tact , Mr. Bucket rubs his hands .
“ Have you anything new to communicate , officer ? ” inquires Sir Leicester .
“ Do you wish to hold any conversation with me in private ? ” “ Why — not to-night , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . ” “ Because my time , ” pursues Sir Leicester , “ is wholly at your disposal with a view to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the law . ” Mr. Bucket coughs and glances at Volumnia , <unk> and <unk> , as though he would respectfully observe , “ I do assure you , you ’ re a pretty <unk> .
I ’ ve seen hundreds worse looking at your time of life , I have indeed . ” The fair Volumnia , not quite unconscious perhaps of the <unk> influence of her charms , pauses in the writing of <unk> notes and <unk> adjusts the pearl necklace .
Mr. Bucket <unk> that <unk> in his mind and thinks it as likely as not that Volumnia is writing poetry .
“ If I have not , ” pursues Sir Leicester , “ in the most emphatic manner , <unk> you , officer , to exercise your utmost skill in this <unk> case , I particularly desire to take the present opportunity of <unk> any <unk> I may have made .
Let no expense be a consideration .
I am prepared to <unk> all charges .
You can <unk> none in pursuit of the object you have <unk> that I shall <unk> for a moment to bear . ” Mr. Bucket made Sir Leicester ’ s bow again as a <unk> to this <unk> .
“ My mind , ” Sir Leicester adds with a generous warmth , “ has not , as may be easily supposed , recovered its tone since the late <unk> occurrence .
It is not likely ever to recover its tone .
But it is full of indignation to-night after <unk> the <unk> of <unk> to the <unk> the remains of a faithful , a zealous , a devoted <unk> . ” Sir Leicester ’ s voice <unk> and his grey hair stirs upon his head .
<unk> are in his eyes ; the best part of his nature is aroused .
“ I declare , ” he says , “ I solemnly declare that until this crime is discovered and , in the course of justice , punished , I almost feel as if there were a <unk> upon my name .
A gentleman who has devoted a large portion of his life to me , a gentleman who has devoted the last day of his life to me , a gentleman who has constantly sat at my table and slept under my roof , goes from my house to his own , and is struck down within an hour of his leaving my house .
I cannot say but that he may have been followed from my house , watched at my house , even first marked because of his association with my house — which may have suggested his possessing greater wealth and being altogether of greater importance than his own retiring <unk> would have <unk> .
If I cannot with my means and influence and my position bring all the <unk> of such a crime to light , I fail in the <unk> of my respect for that gentleman ’ s memory and of my fidelity towards one who was ever faithful to me . ” While he makes this <unk> with great emotion and earnestness , looking round the room as if he were addressing an <unk> , Mr. Bucket glances at him with an observant gravity in which there might be , but for the <unk> of the thought , a touch of compassion .
“ The ceremony of to-day , ” continues Sir Leicester , “ <unk> <unk> of the respect in which my deceased friend ” — he lays a <unk> upon the word , for death <unk> all <unk> — “ was held by the flower of the land , has , I say , <unk> the shock I have received from this most horrible and <unk> crime .
If it were my brother who had committed it , I would not spare him . ” Mr. Bucket looks very grave .
Volumnia remarks of the deceased that he was the <unk> and dearest person !
“ You must feel it as a <unk> to you , miss , ” replies Mr. Bucket <unk> , “ no doubt .
He was calculated to BE a <unk> , I ’ m sure he was . ” Volumnia gives Mr. Bucket to understand , in reply , that her sensitive mind is fully made up never to get the better of it as long as she lives , that her <unk> are <unk> for ever , and that she has not the least expectation of ever smiling again .
Meanwhile she folds up a <unk> hat for that <unk> old general at Bath , <unk> of her melancholy condition .
“ It gives a start to a delicate female , ” says Mr. Bucket <unk> , “ but it ’ ll wear off . ” Volumnia wishes of all things to know what is doing ?
Whether they are going to <unk> , or whatever it is , that dreadful soldier ?
Whether he had any <unk> , or whatever the thing is called in the law ?
And a great deal more to the like <unk> purpose .
“ Why you see , miss , ” returns Mr. Bucket , bringing the finger into <unk> action — and such is his natural gallantry that he had almost said “ my dear ” — “ it ain ’ t easy to answer those questions at the present moment .
Not at the present moment .
I ’ ve kept myself on this case , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ” whom Mr. Bucket takes into the conversation in right of his importance , “ morning , noon , and night .
But for a glass or two of <unk> , I don ’ t think I could have had my mind so much upon the stretch as it has been .
I <unk> answer your questions , miss , but duty <unk> it .
Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , will very soon be made acquainted with all that has been <unk> .
And I hope that he may find it ” — Mr.
Bucket again looks grave — “ to his satisfaction . ” The debilitated cousin only hopes some fler ’ ll be executed — <unk> .
<unk> more interest ’ s wanted — get man hanged <unk> — than get man place ten thousand a year .
<unk> ’ t a doubt — <unk> — far better hang wrong fler than no fler .
“ YOU know life , you know , sir , ” says Mr. Bucket with a <unk> <unk> of his eye and crook of his finger , “ and you can confirm what I ’ ve mentioned to this lady .
YOU don ’ t want to be told that from information I have received I have gone to work .
You ’ re up to what a lady can ’ t be expected to be up to .
Lord !
<unk> in your elevated station of society , miss , ” says Mr. Bucket , quite reddening at another narrow escape from “ my dear . ” “ The officer , Volumnia , ” observes Sir Leicester , “ is faithful to his duty , and perfectly right . ” Mr. Bucket murmurs , “ Glad to have the honour of your <unk> , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . ” “ In fact , Volumnia , ” proceeds Sir Leicester , “ it is not holding up a good model for imitation to ask the officer any such questions as you have put to him .
He is the best judge of his own responsibility ; he <unk> upon his responsibility .
And it does not become us , who assist in making the laws , to <unk> or <unk> with those who carry them into <unk> .
Or , ” says Sir Leicester somewhat sternly , for Volumnia was going to cut in before he had <unk> his sentence , “ or who <unk> their <unk> <unk> . ” Volumnia with all humility explains that she had not merely the <unk> of curiosity to <unk> ( in common with the giddy youth of her sex in general ) but that she is perfectly dying with regret and interest for the darling man whose loss they all <unk> .
“ Very well , Volumnia , ” returns Sir Leicester .
“ Then you cannot be too <unk> . ” Mr. Bucket takes the opportunity of a pause to be heard again .
“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I have no objections to telling this lady , with your leave and among ourselves , that I look upon the case as pretty well complete .
It is a beautiful case — a beautiful case — and what little is wanting to complete it , I expect to be able to <unk> in a few hours . ” “ I am very glad indeed to hear it , ” says Sir Leicester .
“ <unk> <unk> to you . ” “ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ” returns Mr. Bucket very seriously , “ I hope it may at one and the same time do me credit and prove satisfactory to all .
When I <unk> it as a beautiful case , you see , miss , ” Mr. Bucket goes on , glancing gravely at Sir Leicester , “ I mean from my point of view .
As considered from other points of view , such cases will always involve more or less <unk> .
Very strange things comes to our knowledge in families , miss ; bless your heart , what you would think to be <unk> , quite . ” Volumnia , with her innocent little scream , supposes so .
“ Aye , and even in <unk> families , in high families , in great families , ” says Mr. Bucket , again gravely eyeing Sir Leicester aside .
“ I have had the honour of being employed in high families before , and you have no idea — come , I ’ ll go so far as to say not even YOU have any idea , sir , ” this to the debilitated cousin , “ what games goes on ! ” The cousin , who has been casting <unk> on his head , in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , “ <unk> , ” being the <unk> for “ very likely . ” Sir Leicester , <unk> it time to dismiss the officer , here majestically interposes with the words , “ Very good .
Thank you ! ” and also with a wave of his hand , <unk> not only that there is an end of the discourse , but that if high families fall into low habits they must take the consequences .
“ You will not forget , officer , ” he adds with condescension , “ that I am at your disposal when you please . ” Mr. Bucket ( still grave ) inquires if to-morrow morning , now , would suit , in case he should be as for ’ ard as he <unk> to be .
Sir Leicester replies , “ All times are alike to me . ” Mr. Bucket makes his three bows and is withdrawing when a forgotten point <unk> to him .
“ Might I ask , by the by , ” he says in a low voice , <unk> returning , “ who posted the <unk> on the staircase . ” “ I <unk> it to be put up there , ” replies Sir Leicester .
“ Would it be considered a liberty , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , if I was to ask you why ? ” “ Not at all .
I <unk> it as a <unk> part of the house .
I think it cannot be too <unk> kept before the whole establishment .
I wish my people to be impressed with the <unk> of the crime , the determination to <unk> it , and the <unk> of escape .
At the same time , officer , if you in your better knowledge of the subject see any objection — ” Mr. Bucket sees none now ; the bill having been put up , had better not be taken down .
<unk> his three bows he withdraws , closing the door on Volumnia ’ s little scream , which is a <unk> to her <unk> that that <unk> horrible person is a perfect <unk> <unk> .
In his <unk> for society and his <unk> to all <unk> , Mr. Bucket is presently standing before the <unk> — bright and warm on the early winter night — admiring Mercury .
“ Why , you ’ re six foot two , I suppose ? ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Three , ” says Mercury .
“ Are you so much ?
But then , you see , you ’ re broad in <unk> and don ’ t look it .
You ’ re not one of the <unk> ones , you ain ’ t .
Was you ever <unk> now ? ” Mr. Bucket asks , <unk> the expression of an artist into the turn of his eye and head .
Mercury never was <unk> .
“ Then you ought to be , you know , ” says Mr. Bucket ; “ and a friend of mine that you ’ ll hear of one day as a Royal <unk> <unk> would stand something handsome to make a drawing of your proportions for the <unk> .
My Lady ’ s out , ain ’ t she ? ” “ Out to dinner . ” “ <unk> out pretty well every day , don ’ t she ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Not to be wondered at ! ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Such a fine woman as her , so handsome and so graceful and so elegant , is like a fresh <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> wherever she goes .
Was your father in the same way of life as yourself ? ” Answer in the <unk> .
“ Mine was , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ My father was first a page , then a <unk> , then a <unk> , then a steward , then an <unk> .
<unk> universally respected , and died <unk> .
<unk> with his last breath that he considered service the most honourable part of his career , and so it was .
I ’ ve a brother in service , AND a <unk> .
My Lady a good temper ? ” Mercury replies , “ As good as you can expect . ” “ Ah ! ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ A little <unk> ?
A little <unk> ?
Lord !
What can you <unk> when they ’ re so handsome as that ?
And we like ’ em all the better for it , don ’ t we ? ” Mercury , with his hands in the pockets of his bright <unk> <unk> , stretches his <unk> silk legs with the air of a man of gallantry and can ’ t deny it .
Come the roll of wheels and a violent ringing at the bell .
“ <unk> of the angels , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Here she is ! ” The doors are thrown open , and she passes through the hall .
Still very pale , she is dressed in slight mourning and wears two beautiful <unk> .
<unk> their beauty or the beauty of her arms is particularly <unk> to Mr. Bucket .
He looks at them with an eager eye and rattles something in his pocket — halfpence perhaps .
<unk> him at his distance , she turns an <unk> look on the other Mercury who has brought her home .
“ Mr.
Bucket , my Lady . ” Mr. Bucket makes a leg and comes forward , passing his familiar demon over the region of his mouth .
“ Are you waiting to see Sir Leicester ? ” “ No , my Lady , I ’ ve seen him ! ” “ Have you anything to say to me ? ” “ Not just at present , my Lady . ” “ Have you made any new <unk> ? ” “ A few , my Lady . ” This is merely in passing .
She scarcely makes a stop , and sweeps upstairs alone .
Mr. Bucket , moving towards the <unk> , watches her as she goes up the steps the old man came down to his grave , past murderous groups of <unk> repeated with their shadowy weapons on the wall , past the printed bill , which she looks at going by , out of view .
“ She ’ s a lovely woman , too , she really is , ” says Mr. Bucket , coming back to Mercury .
“ Don ’ t look quite healthy though . ” Is not quite healthy , Mercury informs him .
<unk> much from <unk> .
Really ?
That ’ s a pity !
<unk> , Mr. Bucket would recommend for that .
Well , she tries walking , Mercury rejoins .
<unk> sometimes for two hours when she has them bad .
By night , too .
“ Are you sure you ’ re quite so much as six foot three ? ” asks Mr. Bucket .
“ <unk> your pardon for <unk> you a moment ? ” Not a doubt about it .
“ You ’ re so well put together that I shouldn ’ t have thought it .
But the household <unk> , though considered fine men , are built so <unk> .
<unk> by night , does she ?
When it ’ s moonlight , though ? ” Oh , yes .
When it ’ s moonlight !
Of course .
Oh , of course !
<unk> and <unk> on both sides .
“ I suppose you ain ’ t in the habit of walking yourself ? ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Not much time for it , I should say ? ” Besides which , Mercury don ’ t like it .
<unk> carriage exercise .
“ To be sure , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ That makes a difference .
Now I think of it , ” says Mr. Bucket , <unk> his hands and looking pleasantly at the blaze , “ she went out walking the very night of this business . ” “ To be sure she did !
I let her into the garden over the way . ” “ And left her there .
Certainly you did .
I saw you doing it . ” “ I didn ’ t see YOU , ” says Mercury .
“ I was rather in a hurry , ” returns Mr. Bucket , “ for I was going to visit a aunt of mine that lives at <unk> — next door but two to the old original <unk> House — <unk> year old the old lady is , a single woman , and got a little property .
Yes , I <unk> to be passing at the time .
Let ’ s see .
What time might it be ?
It wasn ’ t ten . ” “ <unk> nine . ” “ You ’ re right .
So it was .
And if I don ’ t deceive myself , my Lady was muffled in a loose black <unk> , with a deep <unk> to it ? ” “ Of course she was . ” Of course she was .
Mr. Bucket must return to a little work he has to get on with upstairs , but he must shake hands with Mercury in acknowledgment of his agreeable conversation , and will he — this is all he asks — will he , when he has a leisure half-hour , think of <unk> it on that Royal <unk> <unk> , for the advantage of both parties ?
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> a Mine <unk> by sleep , Mr. Bucket rises <unk> in the morning and prepares for a <unk> .
<unk> up by the aid of a clean <unk> and a wet <unk> , with which instrument , on occasions of ceremony , he <unk> such thin locks as remain to him after his life of severe study , Mr. Bucket lays in a breakfast of two mutton chops as a <unk> to work upon , together with tea , <unk> , toast , and <unk> on a <unk> scale .
Having much enjoyed these strengthening matters and having held <unk> conference with his familiar demon , he confidently <unk> Mercury “ just to mention quietly to Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , that whenever he ’ s ready for me , I ’ m ready for him . ” A gracious message being returned that Sir Leicester will <unk> his <unk> and join Mr. Bucket in the library within ten minutes , Mr. Bucket repairs to that apartment and stands before the fire with his finger on his chin , looking at the blazing <unk> .
<unk> Mr. Bucket is , as a man may be with <unk> work to do , but composed , sure , confident .
From the expression of his face he might be a famous <unk> for a large stake — say a hundred guineas certain — with the game in his hand , but with a high reputation involved in his playing his hand out to the last card in a masterly way .
Not in the least anxious or disturbed is Mr. Bucket when Sir Leicester appears , but he eyes the baronet aside as he comes slowly to his easy-chair with that observant gravity of yesterday in which there might have been yesterday , but for the <unk> of the idea , a touch of compassion .
“ I am sorry to have kept you waiting , officer , but I am rather later than my usual hour this morning .
I am not well .
The agitation and the indignation from which I have recently suffered have been too much for me .
I am subject to — gout ” — Sir Leicester was going to say <unk> and would have said it to anybody else , but Mr. Bucket <unk> knows all about it — “ and <unk> circumstances have brought it on . ” As he takes his seat with some difficulty and with an air of pain , Mr. Bucket draws a little nearer , standing with one of his large hands on the <unk> .
“ I am not aware , officer , ” Sir Leicester observes ; raising his eyes to his face , “ whether you wish us to be alone , but that is entirely as you please .
If you do , well and good .
If not , Miss Dedlock would be interested — ” “ Why , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ” returns Mr. Bucket with his head <unk> on one side and his forefinger <unk> at one ear like an <unk> , “ we can ’ t be too private just at present .
You will presently see that we can ’ t be too private .
A lady , under the circumstances , and especially in Miss Dedlock ’ s elevated station of society , can ’ t but be agreeable to me , but speaking without a view to myself , I will take the liberty of <unk> you that I know we can ’ t be too private . ” “ That is enough . ” “ So much so , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ” Mr. Bucket resumes , “ that I was on the point of asking your permission to turn the key in the door . ” “ By all means . ” Mr. Bucket <unk> and softly takes that precaution , stooping on his knee for a moment from mere force of habit so to <unk> the key in the lock as that no one shall peep in from the <unk> .
“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I mentioned yesterday evening that I wanted but a very little to complete this case .
I have now completed it and collected proof against the person who did this crime . ” “ <unk> the soldier ? ” “ No , Sir Leicester Dedlock ; not the soldier . ” Sir Leicester looks <unk> and inquires , “ Is the man in custody ? ” Mr. Bucket tells him , after a pause , “ It was a woman . ” Sir Leicester leans back in his chair , and <unk> <unk> , “ Good heaven ! ” “ Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ” Mr. Bucket begins , standing over him with one hand spread out on the <unk> and the forefinger of the other in impressive use , “ it ’ s my duty to prepare you for a train of circumstances that may , and I go so far as to say that will , give you a shock .
But Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , you are a gentleman , and I know what a gentleman is and what a gentleman is capable of .
A gentleman can bear a shock when it must come , <unk> and steadily .
A gentleman can make up his mind to stand up against almost any blow .
Why , take yourself , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet .
If there ’ s a blow to be <unk> on you , you naturally think of your family .
You ask yourself , how would all them <unk> of yours , away to <unk> <unk> — not to go beyond him at present — have borne that blow ; you remember scores of them that would have borne it well ; and you bear it well on their accounts , and to maintain the family credit .
That ’ s the way you <unk> , and that ’ s the way you act , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . ” Sir Leicester , leaning back in his chair and <unk> the elbows , sits looking at him with a <unk> face .
“ Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , ” proceeds Mr. Bucket , “ thus preparing you , let me beg of you not to trouble your mind for a moment as to anything having come to MY knowledge .
I know so much about so many <unk> , high and low , that a piece of information more or less don ’ t <unk> a straw .
I don ’ t suppose there ’ s a move on the board that would surprise ME , and as to this or that move having taken place , why my knowing it is no odds at all , any possible move whatever ( provided it ’ s in a wrong direction ) being a probable move according to my experience .
Therefore , what I say to you , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , is , don ’ t you go and let yourself be put out of the way because of my knowing anything of your family affairs . ” “ I thank you for your preparation , ” returns Sir Leicester after a silence , without moving hand , foot , or feature , “ which I hope is not necessary ; though I give it credit for being well intended .
Be so good as to go on .
Also ” — Sir Leicester seems to <unk> in the shadow of his figure — “ also , to take a seat , if you have no objection . ” None at all .
Mr. Bucket brings a chair and <unk> his shadow .
“ Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , with this short <unk> I come to the point .
Lady Dedlock — ” Sir Leicester <unk> himself in his seat and stares at him <unk> .
Mr. Bucket brings the finger into play as an <unk> .
“ Lady Dedlock , you see she ’ s universally admired .
That ’ s what her ladyship is ; she ’ s universally admired , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ I would greatly prefer , officer , ” Sir Leicester returns <unk> , “ my Lady ’ s name being entirely <unk> from this <unk> . ” “ So would I , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , but — it ’ s impossible . ” “ <unk> ? ” Mr. Bucket shakes his <unk> head .
“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , it ’ s altogether impossible .
What I have got to say is about her ladyship .
She is the <unk> it all turns on . ” “ <unk> , ” retorts Sir Leicester with a fiery eye and a <unk> lip , “ you know your duty .
Do your duty , but be careful not to <unk> it .
I would not suffer it .
I would not <unk> it .
You bring my Lady ’ s name into this communication upon your responsibility — upon your responsibility .
My Lady ’ s name is not a name for common persons to trifle with ! ” “ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I say what I must say , and no more . ” “ I hope it may prove so .
Very well .
Go on .
Go on , sir ! ” <unk> at the angry eyes which now avoid him and at the angry figure trembling from head to foot , yet striving to be still , Mr. Bucket feels his way with his forefinger and in a low voice proceeds .
“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , it becomes my duty to tell you that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn long entertained <unk> and suspicions of Lady Dedlock . ” “ If he had dared to breathe them to me , sir — which he never did — I would have killed him myself ! ” exclaims Sir Leicester , striking his hand upon the table .
But in the very heat and <unk> of the act he stops , fixed by the knowing eyes of Mr. Bucket , whose forefinger is slowly going and who , with mingled confidence and patience , shakes his head .
“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn was deep and close , and what he fully had in his mind in the very beginning I can ’ t quite take upon myself to say .
But I know from his lips that he long ago suspected Lady Dedlock of having discovered , through the sight of some handwriting — in this very house , and when you yourself , Sir Leicester Dedlock , were present — the existence , in great <unk> , of a certain person who had been her lover before you <unk> her and who ought to have been her husband . ” Mr. Bucket stops and deliberately repeats , “ <unk> to have been her husband , not a doubt about it .
I know from his lips that when that person soon afterwards died , he suspected Lady Dedlock of <unk> his wretched lodging and his wretched grave , alone and in secret .
I know from my own inquiries and through my eyes and ears that Lady Dedlock did make such visit in the dress of her own maid , for the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn employed me to <unk> up her ladyship — if you ’ ll excuse my making use of the term we <unk> employ — and I <unk> her up , so far , completely .
I <unk> the maid in the chambers in Lincoln ’ s Inn Fields with a witness who had been Lady Dedlock ’ s guide , and there couldn ’ t be the shadow of a doubt that she had worn the young woman ’ s dress , unknown to her .
Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I did endeavour to <unk> the way a little towards these unpleasant <unk> yesterday by saying that very strange things happened even in high families sometimes .
All this , and more , has happened in your own family , and to and through your own Lady .
It ’ s my belief that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn followed up these inquiries to the hour of his death and that he and Lady Dedlock even had bad blood between them upon the matter that very night .
Now , only you put that to Lady Dedlock , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and ask her ladyship whether , even after he had left here , she didn ’ t go down to his chambers with the intention of saying something further to him , dressed in a loose black <unk> with a deep <unk> to it . ” Sir Leicester sits like a <unk> , <unk> at the cruel finger that is <unk> the <unk> of his heart .
“ You put that to her ladyship , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , from me , Inspector Bucket of the Detective .
And if her ladyship makes any difficulty about <unk> of it , you tell her that it ’ s no use , that Inspector Bucket knows it and knows that she passed the soldier as you called him ( though he ’ s not in the army now ) and knows that she knows she passed him on the staircase .
Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , why do I relate all this ? ” Sir Leicester , who has covered his face with his hands , <unk> a single groan , <unk> him to pause for a moment .
By and by he takes his hands away , and so <unk> his dignity and outward calmness , though there is no more colour in his face than in his white hair , that Mr. Bucket is a little <unk> by him .
Something frozen and fixed is upon his manner , over and above its usual <unk> of <unk> , and Mr. Bucket soon <unk> an unusual <unk> in his speech , with now and then a curious trouble in beginning , which occasions him to utter <unk> sounds .
With such sounds he now breaks silence , soon , however , <unk> himself to say that he does not comprehend why a gentleman so faithful and zealous as the late Mr. Tulkinghorn should have communicated to him nothing of this painful , this <unk> , this <unk> , this <unk> , this <unk> intelligence .
“ Again , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ” returns Mr. Bucket , “ put it to her ladyship to clear that up .
Put it to her ladyship , if you think it right , from Inspector Bucket of the Detective .
You ’ ll find , or I ’ m much mistaken , that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn had the intention of communicating the whole to you as soon as he considered it <unk> , and further , that he had given her ladyship so to understand .
Why , he might have been going to <unk> it the very morning when I examined the body !
You don ’ t know what I ’ m going to say and do five minutes from this present time , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ; and supposing I was to be picked off now , you might wonder why I hadn ’ t done it , don ’ t you see ? ” True .
Sir Leicester , <unk> , with some trouble those <unk> sounds , says , “ True . ” At this <unk> a considerable noise of voices is heard in the hall .
Mr. Bucket , after listening , goes to the <unk> , softly unlocks and opens it , and listens again .
Then he draws in his head and whispers hurriedly but composedly , “ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , this unfortunate family affair has taken air , as I expected it might , the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn being cut down so sudden .
The chance to <unk> it is to let in these people now in a <unk> with your <unk> .
Would you mind sitting quiet — on the family account — while I <unk> ’ em up ?
And would you just throw in a nod when I seem to ask you for it ? ” Sir Leicester <unk> answers , “ <unk> .
The best you can , the best you can ! ” and Mr. Bucket , with a nod and a sagacious crook of the forefinger , <unk> down into the hall , where the voices quickly die away .
He is not long in returning ; a few paces <unk> of Mercury and a brother <unk> also <unk> and in <unk> <unk> , who bear between them a chair in which is an incapable old man .
Another man and two women come behind .
<unk> the <unk> of the chair in an affable and easy manner , Mr. Bucket <unk> the Mercuries and locks the door again .
Sir Leicester looks on at this <unk> of the sacred <unk> with an <unk> stare .
“ Now , perhaps you may know me , ladies and gentlemen , ” says Mr. Bucket in a confidential voice .
“ I am Inspector Bucket of the Detective , I am ; and this , ” producing the <unk> of his convenient little staff from his <unk> , “ is my authority .
Now , you wanted to see Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet .
Well !
You do see him , and mind you , it ain ’ t every one as is admitted to that honour .
Your name , old gentleman , is Smallweed ; that ’ s what your name is ; I know it well . ” “ Well , and you never heard any harm of it ! ” cries Mr. Smallweed in a shrill loud voice .
“ You don ’ t happen to know why they killed the pig , do you ? ” retorts Mr. Bucket with a <unk> look , but without loss of temper .
“ No ! ” “ Why , they killed him , ” says Mr. Bucket , “ on account of his having so much cheek .
Don ’ t YOU get into the same position , because it isn ’ t worthy of you .
You ain ’ t in the habit of <unk> with a deaf person , are you ? ” “ Yes , ” <unk> Mr. Smallweed , “ my wife ’ s deaf . ” “ That accounts for your <unk> your voice so high .
But as she ain ’ t here ; just pitch it an <unk> or two lower , will you , and I ’ ll not only be obliged to you , but it ’ ll do you more credit , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ This other gentleman is in the <unk> line , I think ? ” “ Name of Chadband , ” Mr. Smallweed puts in , speaking henceforth in a much lower key .
“ Once had a friend and brother <unk> of the same name , ” says Mr. Bucket , offering his hand , “ and consequently feel a liking for it .
Mrs. Chadband , no doubt ? ” “ And Mrs. Snagsby , ” Mr. Smallweed <unk> .
“ <unk> a law-stationer and a friend of my own , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ <unk> him like a brother !
Now , what ’ s up ? ” “ Do you mean what business have we come upon ? ” Mr. Smallweed asks , a little dashed by the <unk> of this turn .
“ Ah !
You know what I mean .
Let us hear what it ’ s all about in presence of Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet .
Come . ” Mr. Smallweed , <unk> Mr. Chadband , takes a moment ’ s counsel with him in a whisper .
Mr. Chadband , expressing a considerable amount of oil from the <unk> of his forehead and the <unk> of his hands , says aloud , “ Yes .
You first ! ” and retires to his former place .
“ I was the client and friend of Mr. Tulkinghorn , ” pipes Grandfather Smallweed then ; “ I did business with him .
I was useful to him , and he was useful to me .
Krook , dead and gone , was my <unk> .
He was own brother to a brimstone <unk> — <unk> Mrs. Smallweed .
I come into Krook ’ s property .
I examined all his papers and all his effects .
They was all <unk> out under my eyes .
There was a bundle of letters belonging to a dead and gone lodger as was hid away at the back of a shelf in the side of Lady Jane ’ s bed — his cat ’ s bed .
He hid all manner of things away , <unk> .
Mr. Tulkinghorn wanted ’ em and got ’ em , but I looked ’ em over first .
I ’ m a man of business , and I took a <unk> at ’ em .
They was letters from the lodger ’ s <unk> , and she <unk> <unk> .
Dear me , that ’ s not a common name , <unk> , is it ?
There ’ s no lady in this house that signs <unk> is there ?
Oh , no , I don ’ t think so !
Oh , no , I don ’ t think so !
And not in the same hand , perhaps ?
Oh , no , I don ’ t think so ! ” Here Mr. Smallweed , seized with a fit of coughing in the midst of his triumph , breaks off to <unk> , “ Oh , dear me !
Oh , Lord !
I ’ m shaken all to pieces ! ” “ Now , when you ’ re ready , ” says Mr. Bucket after <unk> his recovery , “ to come to anything that concerns Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , here the gentleman sits , you know . ” “ <unk> ’ t I come to it , Mr. Bucket ? ” cries Grandfather Smallweed .
“ <unk> ’ t the gentleman concerned yet ?
Not with Captain Hawdon , and his ever affectionate <unk> , and their child into the bargain ?
Come , then , I want to know where those letters are .
That concerns me , if it don ’ t concern Sir Leicester Dedlock .
I will know where they are .
I won ’ t have ’ em <unk> so quietly .
I handed ’ em over to my friend and solicitor , Mr. Tulkinghorn , not to anybody else . ” “ Why , he paid you for them , you know , and handsome too , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ I don ’ t care for that .
I want to know who ’ s got ’ em .
And I tell you what we want — what we all here want , Mr. Bucket .
We want more <unk> and <unk> into this murder .
We know where the interest and the <unk> was , and you have not done enough .
If George the vagabond <unk> had any hand in it , he was only an <unk> , and was set on .
You know what I mean as well as any man . ” “ Now I tell you what , ” says Mr. Bucket , <unk> <unk> his manner , coming close to him , and communicating an extraordinary fascination to the forefinger , “ I am <unk> if I am a-going to have my case <unk> , or <unk> with , or anticipated by so much as half a second of time by any human being in <unk> .
YOU want more <unk> and <unk> !
YOU do ?
Do you see this hand , and do you think that I don ’ t know the right time to stretch it out and put it on the arm that <unk> that shot ? ” Such is the dread power of the man , and so <unk> evident it is that he makes no idle boast , that Mr. Smallweed begins to <unk> .
Mr. Bucket , <unk> his sudden anger , checks him .
“ The advice I give you is , don ’ t you trouble your head about the murder .
That ’ s my affair .
You keep half an eye on the newspapers , and I shouldn ’ t wonder if you was to read something about it before long , if you look sharp .
I know my business , and that ’ s all I ’ ve got to say to you on that subject .
Now about those letters .
You want to know who ’ s got ’ em .
I don ’ t mind telling you .
I have got ’ em .
Is that the <unk> ? ” Mr. Smallweed looks , with <unk> eyes , at the little bundle Mr. Bucket produces from a mysterious part of his coat , and <unk> it as the same .
“ What have you got to say next ? ” asks Mr. Bucket .
“ Now , don ’ t open your mouth too wide , because you don ’ t look handsome when you do it . ” “ I want five hundred pound . ” “ No , you don ’ t ; you mean fifty , ” says Mr. Bucket <unk> .
It appears , however , that Mr. Smallweed means five hundred .
“ That is , I am <unk> by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , to consider ( without <unk> or promising anything ) this bit of business , ” says Mr. Bucket — Sir Leicester <unk> bows his head — “ and you ask me to consider a proposal of five hundred pounds .
Why , it ’ s an unreasonable proposal !
Two fifty would be bad enough , but better than that .
Hadn ’ t you better say two fifty ? ” Mr. Smallweed is quite clear that he had better not .
“ Then , ” says Mr. Bucket , “ let ’ s hear Mr. Chadband .
Lord !
Many a time I ’ ve heard my old <unk> of that name ; and a <unk> man he was in all respects , as ever I come across ! ” Thus invited , Mr. Chadband steps forth , and after a little <unk> smiling and a little <unk> with the <unk> of his hands , delivers himself as follows , “ My friends , we are now — Rachael , my wife , and I — in the <unk> of the rich and great .
Why are we now in the <unk> of the rich and great , my friends ?
Is it because we are invited ?
Because we are bidden to <unk> with them , because we are bidden to rejoice with them , because we are bidden to play the <unk> with them , because we are bidden to dance with them ?
No .
Then why are we here , my friends ?
<unk> we in possession of a <unk> secret , and do we require <unk> , and wine , and oil , or what is much the same thing , money , for the keeping thereof ?
Probably so , my friends . ” “ You ’ re a man of business , you are , ” returns Mr. Bucket , very attentive , “ and consequently you ’ re going on to mention what the nature of your secret is .
You are right .
You couldn ’ t do better . ” “ Let us then , my brother , in a spirit of love , ” says Mr. Chadband with a <unk> eye , “ proceed unto it .
Rachael , my wife , advance ! ” Mrs. Chadband , more than ready , so advances as to <unk> her husband into the <unk> and <unk> Mr. Bucket with a hard , frowning smile .
“ Since you want to know what we know , ” says she , “ I ’ ll tell you .
I helped to bring up Miss Hawdon , her ladyship ’ s daughter .
I was in the service of her ladyship ’ s sister , who was very sensitive to the disgrace her ladyship brought upon her , and gave out , even to her ladyship , that the child was dead — she WAS very nearly so — when she was born .
But she ’ s alive , and I know her . ” With these words , and a laugh , and laying a bitter <unk> on the word “ ladyship , ” Mrs. Chadband folds her arms and looks <unk> at Mr. Bucket .
“ I suppose now , ” returns that officer , “ YOU will be expecting a <unk> note or a present of about that figure ? ” Mrs. Chadband merely laughs and <unk> tells him he can “ offer ” twenty <unk> .
“ My friend the law-stationer ’ s good lady , over there , ” says Mr. Bucket , <unk> Mrs. Snagsby forward with the finger .
“ What may YOUR game be , ma ’ am ? ” Mrs. Snagsby is at first prevented , by tears and <unk> , from stating the nature of her game , but by degrees it <unk> comes to light that she is a woman <unk> with <unk> and wrongs , whom Mr. Snagsby has habitually <unk> , abandoned , and sought to keep in darkness , and whose chief comfort , under her <unk> , has been the sympathy of the late Mr. Tulkinghorn , who showed so much <unk> for her on one occasion of his calling in Cook ’ s Court in the absence of her <unk> husband that she has of late habitually carried to him all her <unk> .
Everybody it appears , the present company <unk> , has <unk> against Mrs. Snagsby ’ s peace .
There is Mr. Guppy , clerk to Kenge and Carboy , who was at first as open as the sun at noon , but who suddenly shut up as close as midnight , under the influence — no doubt — of Mr. Snagsby ’ s <unk> and <unk> .
There is Mr. Weevle , friend of Mr. Guppy , who lived mysteriously up a court , <unk> to the like <unk> causes .
There was Krook , deceased ; there was Nimrod , deceased ; and there was Jo , deceased ; and they were “ all in it . ” In what , Mrs. Snagsby does not with <unk> express , but she knows that Jo was Mr. Snagsby ’ s son , “ as well as if a <unk> had spoken it , ” and she followed Mr. Snagsby when he went on his last visit to the boy , and if he was not his son why did he go ?
The one occupation of her life has been , for some time back , to follow Mr. Snagsby to and fro , and up and down , and to piece suspicious circumstances together — and every circumstance that has happened has been most suspicious ; and in this way she has pursued her object of <unk> and <unk> her false husband , night and day .
Thus did it come to pass that she brought the Chadbands and Mr. Tulkinghorn together , and <unk> with Mr. Tulkinghorn on the change in Mr. Guppy , and helped to turn up the circumstances in which the present company are interested , casually , by the <unk> , being still and ever on the great high road that is to <unk> in Mr. Snagsby ’ s full <unk> and a <unk> separation .
All this , Mrs. Snagsby , as an injured woman , and the friend of Mrs. Chadband , and the <unk> of Mr. Chadband , and the <unk> of the late Mr. Tulkinghorn , is here to <unk> under the seal of confidence , with every possible confusion and <unk> possible and impossible , having no <unk> <unk> whatever , no scheme or project but the one mentioned , and bringing here , and taking everywhere , her own dense atmosphere of dust , arising from the <unk> working of her mill of jealousy .
While this <unk> is in hand — and it takes some time — Mr.
Bucket , who has seen through the <unk> of Mrs. Snagsby ’ s <unk> at a glance , <unk> with his familiar demon and <unk> his shrewd attention on the Chadbands and Mr. Smallweed .
Sir Leicester Dedlock remains immovable , with the same <unk> surface upon him , except that he once or twice looks towards Mr. Bucket , as <unk> on that officer alone of all mankind .
“ Very good , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Now I understand you , you know , and being <unk> by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , to look into this little matter , ” again Sir Leicester <unk> bows in confirmation of the <unk> , “ can give it my fair and full attention .
Now I won ’ t allude to <unk> to <unk> money or anything of that sort , because we are men and women of the world here , and our object is to make things pleasant .
But I tell you what I DO wonder at ; I am surprised that you should think of making a noise below in the hall .
It was so <unk> to your interests .
That ’ s what I look at . ” “ We wanted to get in , ” <unk> Mr. Smallweed .
“ Why , of course you wanted to get in , ” Mr. Bucket <unk> with cheerfulness ; “ but for a old gentleman at your time of life — what I call truly venerable , mind you ! — with his wits <unk> , as I have no doubt they are , by the loss of the use of his <unk> , which occasions all his animation to mount up into his head , not to consider that if he don ’ t keep such a business as the present as close as possible it can ’ t be worth a <unk> to him , is so curious !
You see your temper got the better of you ; that ’ s where you lost ground , ” says Mr. Bucket in an <unk> and friendly way .
“ I only said I wouldn ’ t go without one of the servants came up to Sir Leicester Dedlock , ” returns Mr. Smallweed .
“ That ’ s it !
That ’ s where your temper got the better of you .
Now , you keep it under another time and you ’ ll make money by it .
Shall I ring for them to carry you down ? ” “ When are we to hear more of this ? ” Mrs. Chadband sternly demands .
“ Bless your heart for a true woman !
Always curious , your delightful sex is ! ” replies Mr. Bucket with gallantry .
“ I shall have the pleasure of giving you a call to-morrow or next day — not <unk> Mr. Smallweed and his proposal of two fifty . ” “ <unk> hundred ! ” exclaims Mr. Smallweed .
“ All right !
<unk> five hundred . ” Mr. Bucket has his hand on the <unk> .
“ <unk> I wish you good day for the present on the part of myself and the gentleman of the house ? ” he asks in an <unk> tone .
Nobody having the <unk> to object to his doing so , he does it , and the party retire as they came up .
Mr. Bucket follows them to the door , and returning , says with an air of serious business , “ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , it ’ s for you to consider whether or not to buy this up .
I should recommend , on the whole , it ’ s being bought up myself ; and I think it may be bought pretty cheap .
You see , that little <unk> <unk> of a Mrs. Snagsby has been used by all sides of the speculation and has done a deal more harm in bringing odds and ends together than if she had meant it .
Mr. Tulkinghorn , deceased , he held all these horses in his hand and could have drove ’ em his own way , I haven ’ t a doubt ; but he was fetched off the box <unk> , and now they have got their legs over the traces , and are all dragging and pulling their own ways .
So it is , and such is life .
The cat ’ s away , and the <unk> they play ; the <unk> breaks up , and the water runs .
Now , with regard to the party to be <unk> . ” Sir Leicester seems to wake , though his eyes have been wide open , and he looks <unk> at Mr. Bucket as Mr. Bucket refers to his watch .
“ The party to be <unk> is now in this house , ” proceeds Mr. Bucket , putting up his watch with a steady hand and with rising spirits , “ and I ’ m about to take her into custody in your presence .
Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , don ’ t you say a word nor yet stir .
There ’ ll be no noise and no <unk> at all .
I ’ ll come back in the course of the evening , if agreeable to you , and endeavour to meet your wishes respecting this unfortunate family matter and the <unk> way of keeping it quiet .
Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , don ’ t you be nervous on account of the apprehension at present coming off .
You shall see the whole case clear , from first to last . ” Mr. Bucket rings , goes to the door , briefly whispers Mercury , shuts the door , and stands behind it with his arms folded .
After a suspense of a minute or two the door slowly opens and a Frenchwoman enters .
Mademoiselle Hortense .
The moment she is in the room Mr. Bucket <unk> the door to and puts his back against it .
The <unk> of the noise occasions her to turn , and then for the first time she sees Sir Leicester Dedlock in his chair .
“ I ask you pardon , ” she mutters hurriedly .
“ They tell me there was no one here . ” Her step towards the door brings her front to front with Mr. Bucket .
<unk> a <unk> <unk> across her face and she turns deadly pale .
“ This is my lodger , Sir Leicester Dedlock , ” says Mr. Bucket , nodding at her .
“ This foreign young woman has been my lodger for some weeks back . ” “ What do Sir Leicester care for that , you think , my angel ? ” returns mademoiselle in a <unk> <unk> .
“ Why , my angel , ” returns Mr. Bucket , “ we shall see . ” Mademoiselle Hortense eyes him with a <unk> upon her tight face , which gradually changes into a smile of scorn , “ You are very <unk> .
Are you drunk ? ” “ <unk> <unk> , my angel , ” returns Mr. Bucket .
“ I come from arriving at this so <unk> house with your wife .
Your wife have left me since some minutes .
They tell me downstairs that your wife is here .
I come here , and your wife is not here .
What is the intention of this fool ’ s play , say then ? ” mademoiselle demands , with her arms composedly crossed , but with something in her dark cheek beating like a clock .
Mr. Bucket merely shakes the finger at her .
“ Ah , my God , you are an unhappy <unk> ! ” cries mademoiselle with a <unk> of her head and a laugh .
“ <unk> me to pass downstairs , great pig . ” With a stamp of her foot and a <unk> .
“ Now , mademoiselle , ” says Mr. Bucket in a cool determined way , “ you go and sit down upon that <unk> . ” “ I will not sit down upon nothing , ” she replies with a shower of nods .
“ Now , mademoiselle , ” repeats Mr. Bucket , making no <unk> except with the finger , “ you sit down upon that <unk> . ” “ Why ? ” “ Because I take you into custody on a charge of murder , and you don ’ t need to be told it .
Now , I want to be polite to one of your sex and a foreigner if I can .
If I can ’ t , I must be rough , and there ’ s <unk> ones outside .
What I am to be <unk> on you .
So I recommend you , as a friend , afore another half a blessed moment has passed over your head , to go and sit down upon that <unk> . ” Mademoiselle <unk> , saying in a <unk> voice while that something in her cheek beats fast and hard , “ You are a devil . ” “ Now , you see , ” Mr. Bucket proceeds <unk> , “ you ’ re comfortable and conducting yourself as I should expect a foreign young woman of your sense to do .
So I ’ ll give you a piece of advice , and it ’ s this , don ’ t you talk too much .
You ’ re not expected to say anything here , and you can ’ t keep too quiet a tongue in your head .
In short , the less you <unk> , the better , you know . ” Mr. Bucket is very complacent over this French explanation .
Mademoiselle , with that <unk> <unk> of the mouth and her black eyes <unk> fire upon him , sits upright on the sofa in a <unk> state , with her hands <unk> — and her feet too , one might suppose — muttering , “ Oh , you Bucket , you are a devil ! ” “ Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ” says Mr. Bucket , and from this time forth the finger never rests , “ this young woman , my lodger , was her ladyship ’ s maid at the time I have mentioned to you ; and this young woman , besides being extraordinary vehement and passionate against her ladyship after being discharged — ” “ Lie ! ” cries mademoiselle .
“ I discharge myself . ” “ Now , why don ’ t you take my advice ? ” returns Mr. Bucket in an impressive , almost in an imploring , tone .
“ I ’ m surprised at the <unk> you commit .
You ’ ll say something that ’ ll be used against you , you know .
You ’ re sure to come to it .
Never you mind what I say till it ’ s given in evidence .
It is not addressed to you . ” “ <unk> , too , ” cries mademoiselle <unk> , “ by her ladyship !
Eh , my faith , a pretty ladyship !
Why , I <unk> my character by remaining with a ladyship so <unk> ! ” “ Upon my soul I wonder at you ! ” Mr. Bucket remonstrates .
“ I thought the French were a polite <unk> , I did , really .
Yet to hear a female going on like that before Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ! ” “ He is a poor <unk> ! ” cries mademoiselle .
“ I <unk> upon his house , upon his name , upon his <unk> , ” all of which she makes the carpet represent .
“ Oh , that he is a great man !
Oh , yes , <unk> !
Oh , heaven !
<unk> ! ” “ Well , Sir Leicester Dedlock , ” proceeds Mr. Bucket , “ this <unk> foreigner also angrily took it into her head that she had established a claim upon Mr. Tulkinghorn , deceased , by attending on the occasion I told you of at his chambers , though she was <unk> paid for her time and trouble . ” “ Lie ! ” cries mademoiselle .
“ I <unk> his money all <unk> . ” “ If you WILL <unk> , you know , ” says Mr. Bucket <unk> , “ you must take the consequences .
Now , whether she became my lodger , Sir Leicester Dedlock , with any <unk> intention then of doing this deed and <unk> me , I give no opinion on ; but she lived in my house in that capacity at the time that she was hovering about the chambers of the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn with a view to a <unk> , and likewise <unk> and half <unk> the life out of an unfortunate stationer . ” “ Lie ! ” cries mademoiselle .
“ All lie ! ” “ The murder was committed , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and you know under what circumstances .
Now , I beg of you to follow me close with your attention for a minute or two .
I was sent for , and the case was <unk> to me .
I examined the place , and the body , and the papers , and everything .
From information I received ( from a clerk in the same house ) I took George into custody as having been seen hanging about there on the night , and at very <unk> the time of the murder , also as having been overheard in high words with the deceased on former occasions — even threatening him , as the witness made out .
If you ask me , Sir Leicester Dedlock , whether from the first I believed George to be the <unk> , I tell you <unk> no , but he might be , notwithstanding , and there was enough against him to make it my duty to take him and get him kept under <unk> .
Now , observe ! ” As Mr. Bucket bends forward in some excitement — for him — and <unk> what he is going to say with one ghostly beat of his forefinger in the air , Mademoiselle Hortense <unk> her black eyes upon him with a dark frown and sets her dry lips closely and <unk> together .
“ I went home , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , at night and found this young woman having supper with my wife , Mrs. Bucket .
She had made a mighty show of being fond of Mrs. Bucket from her first offering herself as our lodger , but that night she made more than ever — in fact , <unk> it .
<unk> she <unk> her respect , and all that , for the <unk> memory of the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn .
By the living Lord it <unk> upon me , as I sat opposite to her at the table and saw her with a knife in her hand , that she had done it ! ” Mademoiselle is hardly audible in <unk> through her teeth and lips the words , “ You are a devil . ” “ Now where , ” pursues Mr. Bucket , “ had she been on the night of the murder ?
She had been to the <unk> .
( She really was there , I have since found , both before the deed and after it . )
I knew I had an artful customer to deal with and that proof would be very difficult ; and I laid a <unk> for her — such a <unk> as I never laid yet , and such a venture as I never made yet .
I worked it out in my mind while I was talking to her at supper .
When I went upstairs to bed , our house being small and this young woman ’ s ears sharp , I stuffed the <unk> into Mrs. Bucket ’ s mouth that she shouldn ’ t say a word of surprise and told her all about it .
My dear , don ’ t you give your mind to that again , or I shall link your feet together at the <unk> . ” Mr. Bucket , breaking off , has made a <unk> <unk> upon mademoiselle and laid his heavy hand upon her shoulder .
“ What is the matter with you now ? ” she asks him .
“ Don ’ t you think any more , ” returns Mr. Bucket with <unk> finger , “ of throwing yourself out of window .
That ’ s what ’ s the matter with me .
Come !
Just take my arm .
You needn ’ t get up ; I ’ ll sit down by you .
Now take my arm , will you ?
I ’ m a married man , you know ; you ’ re acquainted with my wife .
Just take my arm . ” <unk> endeavouring to <unk> those dry lips , with a painful sound she <unk> with herself and <unk> .
“ Now we ’ re all right again .
Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , this case could never have been the case it is but for Mrs. Bucket , who is a woman in fifty thousand — in a hundred and fifty thousand !
To throw this young woman off her guard , I have never set foot in our house since , though I ’ ve communicated with Mrs. Bucket in the <unk> ’ s <unk> and in the milk as often as required .
My whispered words to Mrs. Bucket when she had the <unk> in her mouth were , ‘ My dear , can you throw her off continually with natural accounts of my suspicions against George , and this , and that , and t ’ other ?
Can you do without rest and keep watch upon her night and day ?
Can you undertake to say , ‘ She shall do nothing without my knowledge , she shall be my prisoner without <unk> it , she shall no more escape from me than from death , and her life shall be my life , and her soul my soul , till I have got her , if she did this murder ? ’ Mrs. Bucket says to me , as well as she could speak on account of the <unk> , ‘ Bucket , I can ! ’ And she has <unk> up to it glorious ! ” “ <unk> ! ” mademoiselle interposes .
“ All lies , my friend ! ” “ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , how did my <unk> come out under these circumstances ?
When I calculated that this <unk> young woman would <unk> it in new directions , was I wrong or right ?
I was right .
What does she try to do ?
Don ’ t let it give you a turn ?
To throw the murder on her ladyship . ” Sir Leicester rises from his chair and <unk> down again .
“ And she got encouragement in it from hearing that I was always here , which was done <unk> .
Now , open that <unk> of mine , Sir Leicester Dedlock , if I may take the liberty of throwing it towards you , and look at the letters sent to me , each with the two words ‘ Lady Dedlock ’ in it .
<unk> the one directed to yourself , which I stopped this very morning , and read the three words ‘ Lady Dedlock , <unk> ’ in it .
These letters have been falling about like a shower of <unk> .
What do you say now to Mrs. Bucket , from her <unk> having seen them all written by this young woman ?
What do you say to Mrs. Bucket having , within this half-hour , secured the <unk> ink and paper , fellow <unk> and what not ?
What do you say to Mrs. Bucket having watched the <unk> of ’ em every one by this young woman , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ? ” Mr. Bucket asks , triumphant in his admiration of his lady ’ s <unk> .
Two things are especially <unk> as Mr. Bucket proceeds to a conclusion .
First , that he seems <unk> to establish a dreadful right of property in mademoiselle .
Secondly , that the very atmosphere she <unk> seems to narrow and <unk> about her as if a close <unk> or a <unk> were being drawn nearer and yet nearer around her breathless figure .
“ There is no doubt that her ladyship was on the spot at the <unk> period , ” says Mr. Bucket , “ and my foreign friend here saw her , I believe , from the upper part of the staircase .
Her ladyship and George and my foreign friend were all pretty close on one another ’ s heels .
But that don ’ t <unk> any more , so I ’ ll not go into it .
I found the <unk> of the pistol with which the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn was shot .
It was a bit of the printed description of your house at Chesney Wold .
Not much in that , you ’ ll say , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet .
No .
But when my foreign friend here is so thoroughly off her guard as to think it a safe time to tear up the rest of that leaf , and when Mrs. Bucket puts the pieces together and finds the <unk> wanting , it begins to look like <unk> Street . ” “ These are very long lies , ” mademoiselle interposes .
“ You prose great deal .
Is it that you have almost all finished , or are you speaking always ? ” “ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ” proceeds Mr. Bucket , who <unk> in a full title and does violence to himself when he <unk> with any fragment of it , “ the last point in the case which I am now going to mention shows the necessity of patience in our business , and never doing a thing in a hurry .
I watched this young woman yesterday without her knowledge when she was looking at the funeral , in company with my wife , who <unk> to take her there ; and I had so much to <unk> her , and I saw such an expression in her face , and my mind so rose against her <unk> towards her ladyship , and the time was altogether such a time for bringing down what you may call <unk> upon her , that if I had been a younger hand with less experience , I should have taken her , certain .
<unk> , last night , when her ladyship , as is so universally admired I am sure , come home looking — why , Lord , a man might almost say like <unk> rising from the <unk> — it was so unpleasant and <unk> to think of her being charged with a murder of which she was innocent that I felt quite to want to put an end to the job .
What should I have lost ?
Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I should have lost the <unk> .
My prisoner here proposed to Mrs. Bucket , after the departure of the funeral , that they should go <unk> <unk> a little ways into the country and take tea at a very decent house of entertainment .
Now , near that house of entertainment there ’ s a piece of water .
At tea , my prisoner got up to fetch her <unk> from the bedroom where the bonnets was ; she was rather a long time gone and came back a little out of wind .
As soon as they came home this was reported to me by Mrs. Bucket , along with her observations and suspicions .
I had the piece of water dragged by moonlight , in presence of a couple of our men , and the pocket pistol was brought up before it had been there half-a-dozen hours .
Now , my dear , put your arm a little further through mine , and hold it steady , and I <unk> ’ t hurt you ! ” In a <unk> Mr. Bucket <unk> a <unk> on her <unk> .
“ That ’ s one , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Now the other , darling .
Two , and all told ! ” He rises ; she rises too .
“ Where , ” she asks him , darkening her large eyes until their drooping <unk> almost conceal them — and yet they stare , “ where is your false , your <unk> , and <unk> wife ? ” “ She ’ s gone <unk> to the <unk> Office , ” returns Mr. Bucket .
“ You ’ ll see her there , my dear . ” “ I would like to kiss her ! ” exclaims Mademoiselle Hortense , panting <unk> .
“ You ’ d bite her , I suspect , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ I would ! ” making her eyes very large .
“ I would love to tear her limb from limb . ” “ Bless you , darling , ” says Mr. Bucket with the greatest composure , “ I ’ m fully prepared to hear that .
Your sex have such a surprising <unk> against one another when you do <unk> .
You don ’ t mind me half so much , do you ? ” “ No .
Though you are a devil still . ” “ <unk> and devil by turns , eh ? ” cries Mr. Bucket .
“ But I am in my regular employment , you must consider .
Let me put your shawl tidy .
I ’ ve been lady ’ s maid to a good many before now .
Anything wanting to the bonnet ?
There ’ s a cab at the door . ” Mademoiselle Hortense , casting an indignant eye at the glass , shakes herself perfectly neat in one shake and looks , to do her justice , uncommonly genteel .
“ Listen then , my angel , ” says she after several <unk> nods .
“ You are very spiritual .
But can you restore him back to life ? ” Mr. Bucket answers , “ Not exactly . ” “ That is droll .
Listen yet one time .
You are very spiritual .
Can you make a honourable lady of her ? ” “ Don ’ t be so <unk> , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Or a haughty gentleman of HIM ? ” cries mademoiselle , referring to Sir Leicester with <unk> <unk> .
“ Eh !
Oh , then regard him !
The poor infant !
Ha !
Ha !
Ha ! ” “ Come , come , why this is worse <unk> than the other , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ Come along ! ” “ You cannot do these things ?
Then you can do as you please with me .
It is but the death , it is all the same .
Let us go , my angel .
<unk> , you old man , grey .
I pity you , and I <unk> you ! ” With these last words she <unk> her teeth together as if her mouth closed with a spring .
It is impossible to describe how Mr. Bucket gets her out , but he <unk> that <unk> in a manner so peculiar to himself , <unk> and <unk> her like a cloud , and hovering away with her as if he were a homely <unk> and she the object of his <unk> .
Sir Leicester , left alone , remains in the same attitude , as though he were still listening and his attention were still occupied .
At length he <unk> round the empty room , and finding it deserted , rises <unk> to his feet , <unk> back his chair , and walks a few steps , <unk> himself by the table .
Then he stops , and with more of those <unk> sounds , lifts up his eyes and seems to stare at something .
Heaven knows what he sees .
The green , green woods of Chesney Wold , the noble house , the pictures of his <unk> , <unk> <unk> them , officers of police <unk> <unk> his most precious <unk> , thousands of fingers pointing at him , thousands of faces <unk> at him .
But if such shadows <unk> before him to his <unk> , there is one other shadow which he can name with something like distinctness even yet and to which alone he addresses his tearing of his white hair and his extended arms .
It is she in association with whom , <unk> that she has been for years a main <unk> of the <unk> of his dignity and pride , he has never had a selfish thought .
It is she whom he has loved , admired , honoured , and set up for the world to respect .
It is she who , at the <unk> of all the constrained <unk> and <unk> of his life , has been a stock of living tenderness and love , susceptible as nothing else is of being struck with the agony he feels .
He sees her , almost to the <unk> of himself , and cannot bear to look upon her cast down from the high place she has <unk> so well .
And even to the point of his sinking on the ground , <unk> of his suffering , he can yet <unk> her name with something like distinctness in the midst of those <unk> sounds , and in a tone of mourning and compassion rather than reproach .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> Inspector Bucket of the Detective has not yet struck his great blow , as just now <unk> , but is yet <unk> himself with sleep <unk> to his <unk> , when through the night and along the <unk> wintry roads a chaise and pair comes out of Lincolnshire , making its way towards London .
<unk> shall soon <unk> all this country , and with a rattle and a glare the <unk> and train shall <unk> like a <unk> over the wide <unk> , turning the moon <unk> ; but as yet such things are <unk> in these parts , though not wholly unexpected .
<unk> are <unk> , <unk> are made , ground is <unk> out .
<unk> are begun , and their not yet united <unk> <unk> look at one another over roads and streams like brick and mortar <unk> with an <unk> to their <unk> ; fragments of <unk> are thrown up and left as <unk> with <unk> of rusty <unk> and <unk> tumbling over them ; <unk> of tall <unk> appear on <unk> , where there are <unk> of <unk> ; everything looks <unk> and abandoned in full <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> roads , and through the night , the <unk> makes its way without a <unk> on its mind .
Mrs. Rouncewell , so many years housekeeper at Chesney Wold , sits within the chaise ; and by her side sits Mrs. Bagnet with her grey cloak and umbrella .
The old girl would prefer the bar in front , as being exposed to the weather and a <unk> sort of <unk> more in <unk> with her usual course of travelling , but Mrs. Rouncewell is too thoughtful of her comfort to admit of her proposing it .
The old lady cannot make enough of the old girl .
She sits , in her stately manner , holding her hand , and <unk> of its <unk> , puts it often to her lips .
“ You are a mother , my dear soul , ” says she many times , “ and you found out my George ’ s mother ! ” “ Why , George , ” returns Mrs. Bagnet , “ was always free with me , ma ’ am , and when he said at our house to my Woolwich that of all the things my Woolwich could have to think of when he grew to be a man , the <unk> would be that he had never brought a sorrowful line into his mother ’ s face or turned a hair of her head grey , then I felt sure , from his way , that something fresh had brought his own mother into his mind .
I had often known him say to me , in past times , that he had <unk> bad to her . ” “ Never , my dear ! ” returns Mrs. Rouncewell , bursting into tears .
“ My blessing on him , never !
He was always fond of me , and loving to me , was my George !
But he had a bold spirit , and he ran a little wild and went for a soldier .
And I know he waited at first , in letting us know about himself , till he should rise to be an officer ; and when he didn ’ t rise , I know he considered himself beneath us , and wouldn ’ t be a disgrace to us .
For he had a <unk> heart , had my George , always from a baby ! ” The old lady ’ s hands stray about her as of <unk> , while she recalls , all in a tremble , what a likely lad , what a fine lad , what a gay good-humoured clever lad he was ; how they all took to him down at Chesney Wold ; how Sir Leicester took to him when he was a young gentleman ; how the dogs took to him ; how even the people who had been angry with him <unk> him the moment he was gone , poor boy .
And now to see him after all , and in a prison too !
And the broad stomacher <unk> , and the <unk> upright old-fashioned figure bends under its load of affectionate distress .
Mrs. Bagnet , with the <unk> skill of a good warm heart , leaves the old housekeeper to her emotions for a little while — not without passing the back of her hand across her own motherly eyes — and presently <unk> up in her <unk> manner , “ So I says to George when I goes to call him in to tea ( he pretended to be smoking his pipe outside ) , ‘ What <unk> you this afternoon , George , for gracious sake ?
I have seen all sorts , and I have seen you pretty often in season and out of season , abroad and at home , and I never see you so melancholy <unk> . ’ ‘ Why , Mrs. Bagnet , ’ says George , ‘ it ’ s because I AM melancholy and <unk> both , this afternoon , that you see me so . ’ ‘ What have you done , old fellow ? ’ I says .
‘ Why , Mrs. Bagnet , ’ says George , shaking his head , ‘ what I have done has been done this many a long year , and is best not tried to be undone now .
If I ever get to heaven it won ’ t be for being a good son to a <unk> mother ; I say no more . ’ Now , ma ’ am , when George says to me that it ’ s best not tried to be undone now , I have my thoughts as I have often had before , and I draw it out of George how he comes to have such things on him that afternoon .
Then George tells me that he has seen by chance , at the lawyer ’ s office , a fine old lady that has brought his mother plain before him , and he runs on about that old lady till he quite <unk> himself and <unk> her picture to me as she used to be , years upon years back .
So I says to George when he has done , who is this old lady he has seen ?
And George tells me it ’ s Mrs. Rouncewell , housekeeper for more than half a century to the Dedlock family down at Chesney Wold in Lincolnshire .
George has frequently told me before that he ’ s a Lincolnshire man , and I says to my old Lignum that night , ‘ Lignum , that ’ s his mother for five and <unk> pound ! ’ ” All this Mrs. Bagnet now relates for the <unk> time at least within the last four hours .
<unk> it out like a kind of bird , with a pretty high note , that it may be audible to the old lady above the hum of the wheels .
“ Bless you , and thank you , ” says Mrs. Rouncewell .
“ Bless you , and thank you , my worthy soul ! ” “ Dear heart ! ” cries Mrs. Bagnet in the most natural manner .
“ No thanks to me , I am sure .
<unk> to yourself , ma ’ am , for being so ready to pay ’ em !
And mind once more , ma ’ am , what you had best do on finding George to be your own son is to make him — for your sake — have every sort of help to put himself in the right and clear himself of a charge of which he is as innocent as you or me .
It won ’ t do to have truth and justice on his side ; he must have law and lawyers , ” exclaims the old girl , apparently persuaded that the latter form a separate establishment and have <unk> <unk> with truth and justice for ever and a day .
“ He shall have , ” says Mrs. Rouncewell , “ all the help that can be got for him in the world , my dear .
I will spend all I have , and <unk> , to <unk> it .
Sir Leicester will do his best , the whole family will do their best .
I — I know something , my dear ; and will make my own appeal , as his mother parted from him all these years , and finding him in a <unk> at last . ” The extreme <unk> of the old housekeeper ’ s manner in saying this , her broken words , and her <unk> of her hands make a powerful impression on Mrs. Bagnet and would <unk> her but that she refers them all to her sorrow for her son ’ s condition .
And yet Mrs. Bagnet wonders too why Mrs. Rouncewell should murmur so <unk> , “ My Lady , my Lady , my Lady ! ” over and over again .
The frosty night wears away , and the <unk> breaks , and the <unk> comes rolling on through the early mist like the ghost of a chaise departed .
It has plenty of <unk> company in ghosts of trees and <unk> , slowly <unk> and giving place to the <unk> of day .
London reached , the <unk> <unk> , the old housekeeper in great <unk> and confusion , Mrs. Bagnet quite fresh and collected — as she would be if her next point , with no new <unk> and <unk> , were the <unk> of Good <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or any other military station .
But when they set out for the prison where the trooper is confined , the old lady has <unk> to draw about her , with her <unk> dress , much of the <unk> calmness which is its usual <unk> .
A wonderfully grave , <unk> , and handsome piece of old <unk> she looks , though her heart beats fast and her stomacher is ruffled more than even the remembrance of this <unk> son has ruffled it these many years .
<unk> the <unk> , they find the door opening and a <unk> in the act of coming out .
The old girl promptly makes a sign of entreaty to him to say nothing ; <unk> with a nod , he <unk> them to enter as he shuts the door .
So George , who is writing at his table , supposing himself to be alone , does not raise his eyes , but remains absorbed .
The old housekeeper looks at him , and those wandering hands of hers are quite enough for Mrs. Bagnet ’ s confirmation , even if she could see the mother and the son together , knowing what she knows , and doubt their relationship .
Not a <unk> of the housekeeper ’ s dress , not a gesture , not a word <unk> her .
She stands looking at him as he writes on , all unconscious , and only her fluttering hands give utterance to her emotions .
But they are very eloquent , very , very eloquent .
Mrs. Bagnet <unk> them .
They speak of gratitude , of joy , of grief , of hope ; of <unk> affection , <unk> with no return since this stalwart man was a <unk> ; of a better son loved less , and this son loved so <unk> and so <unk> ; and they speak in such touching language that Mrs. Bagnet ’ s eyes <unk> up with tears and they run <unk> down her <unk> face .
“ George Rouncewell !
Oh , my dear child , turn and look at me ! ” The trooper starts up , <unk> his mother round the neck , and falls down on his knees before her .
Whether in a late <unk> , whether in the first association that comes back upon him , he puts his hands together as a child does when it says its prayers , and raising them towards her breast , bows down his head , and cries .
“ My George , my dearest son !
Always my favourite , and my favourite still , where have you been these cruel years and years ?
<unk> such a man too , grown such a fine strong man .
<unk> so like what I knew he must be , if it pleased God he was alive ! ” She can ask , and he can answer , nothing connected for a time .
All that time the old girl , turned away , leans one arm against the whitened wall , leans her honest forehead upon it , <unk> her eyes with her serviceable grey cloak , and quite <unk> herself like the best of old girls as she is .
“ Mother , ” says the trooper when they are more composed , “ forgive me first of all , for I know my need of it . ” <unk> him !
She does it with all her heart and soul .
She always has done it .
She tells him how she has had it written in her will , these many years , that he was her beloved son George .
She has never believed any ill of him , never .
If she had died without this happiness — and she is an old woman now and can ’ t look to live very long — she would have blessed him with her last breath , if she had had her senses , as her beloved son George .
“ Mother , I have been an <unk> trouble to you , and I have my reward ; but of late years I have had a kind of <unk> of a purpose in me too .
When I left home I didn ’ t care much , mother — I am afraid not a great deal — for leaving ; and went away and ’ <unk> , <unk> , making believe to think that I cared for nobody , no not I , and that nobody cared for me . ” The trooper has dried his eyes and put away his handkerchief , but there is an extraordinary contrast between his habitual manner of expressing himself and carrying himself and the softened tone in which he speaks , interrupted occasionally by a <unk> sob .
“ So I wrote a line home , mother , as you too well know , to say I had ’ <unk> under another name , and I went abroad .
<unk> , at one time I thought I would write home next year , when I might be better off ; and when that year was out , I thought I would write home next year , when I might be better off ; and when that year was out again , perhaps I didn ’ t think much about it .
So on , from year to year , through a service of ten years , till I began to get older , and to ask myself why should I ever write . ” “ I don ’ t find any fault , child — but not to ease my mind , George ?
Not a word to your loving mother , who was growing older too ? ” This almost <unk> the trooper afresh , but he sets himself up with a great , rough , sounding <unk> of his throat .
“ Heaven forgive me , mother , but I thought there would be small consolation then in hearing anything about me .
There were you , respected and esteemed .
There was my brother , as I read in chance North <unk> papers now and then , rising to be prosperous and famous .
There was I a <unk> , <unk> , unsettled , not <unk> like him , but <unk> — all my earlier advantages thrown away , all my little <unk> <unk> , nothing picked up but what <unk> me for most things that I could think of .
What business had I to make myself known ?
After letting all that time go by me , what good could come of it ?
The worst was past with you , mother .
I knew by that time ( being a man ) how you had <unk> for me , and wept for me , and prayed for me ; and the pain was over , or was softened down , and I was better in your mind as it was . ” The old lady <unk> shakes her head , and taking one of his powerful hands , lays it <unk> upon her shoulder .
“ No , I don ’ t say that it was so , mother , but that I made it out to be so .
I said just now , what good could come of it ?
Well , my dear mother , some good might have come of it to myself — and there was the meanness of it .
You would have sought me out ; you would have <unk> my discharge ; you would have taken me down to Chesney Wold ; you would have brought me and my brother and my brother ’ s family together ; you would all have considered anxiously how to do something for me and set me up as a respectable <unk> .
But how could any of you feel sure of me when I couldn ’ t so much as feel sure of myself ?
How could you help regarding as an <unk> and a <unk> to you an idle <unk> chap who was an <unk> and a <unk> to himself , excepting under discipline ?
How could I look my brother ’ s children in the face and pretend to set them an example — I , the vagabond boy who had run away from home and been the grief and <unk> of my mother ’ s life ?
‘ No , George . ’ Such were my words , mother , when I passed this in <unk> before me : ‘ You have made your bed .
Now , lie upon it . ’ ” Mrs. Rouncewell , drawing up her stately form , shakes her head at the old girl with a <unk> pride upon her , as much as to say , “ I told you so ! ” The old girl <unk> her feelings and <unk> her interest in the conversation by giving the trooper a great poke between the shoulders with her umbrella ; this action she afterwards repeats , at intervals , in a species of affectionate lunacy , never <unk> , after the administration of each of these <unk> , to <unk> to the whitened wall and the grey cloak again .
“ This was the way I brought myself to think , mother , that my best <unk> was to lie upon that bed I had made , and die upon it .
And I should have done it ( though I have been to see you more than once down at Chesney Wold , when you little thought of me ) but for my old comrade ’ s wife here , who I find has been too many for me .
But I thank her for it .
I thank you for it , Mrs. Bagnet , with all my heart and might . ” To which Mrs. Bagnet <unk> with two pokes .
And now the old lady <unk> upon her son George , her own dear recovered boy , her joy and pride , the light of her eyes , the happy close of her life , and every fond name she can think of , that he must be <unk> by the best advice <unk> by money and influence , that he must yield up his case to the greatest lawyers that can be got , that he must act in this serious <unk> as he shall be advised to act and must not be <unk> , however right , but must promise to think only of his poor old mother ’ s anxiety and suffering until he is released , or he will break her heart .
“ Mother , ’ <unk> little enough to consent to , ” returns the trooper , stopping her with a kiss ; “ tell me what I shall do , and I ’ ll make a late beginning and do it .
Mrs. Bagnet , you ’ ll take care of my mother , I know ? ” A very hard poke from the old girl ’ s umbrella .
“ If you ’ ll bring her acquainted with Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson , she will find them of her way of thinking , and they will give her the best advice and assistance . ” “ And , George , ” says the old lady , “ we must send with all haste for your brother .
He is a sensible sound man as they tell me — out in the world beyond Chesney Wold , my dear , though I don ’ t know much of it myself — and will be of great service . ” “ Mother , ” returns the trooper , “ is it too soon to ask a favour ? ” “ Surely not , my dear . ” “ Then <unk> me this one great favour .
Don ’ t let my brother know . ” “ Not know what , my dear ? ” “ Not know of me .
In fact , mother , I can ’ t bear it ; I can ’ t make up my mind to it .
He has proved himself so different from me and has done so much to raise himself while I ’ ve been <unk> that I haven ’ t <unk> enough in my composition to see him in this place and under this charge .
How could a man like him be expected to have any pleasure in such a discovery ?
It ’ s impossible .
No , keep my secret from him , mother ; do me a greater kindness than I <unk> and keep my secret from my brother , of all men . ” “ But not always , dear George ? ” “ Why , mother , perhaps not for good and all — though I may come to ask that too — but keep it now , I do entreat you .
If it ’ s ever broke to him that his <unk> of a brother has turned up , I could wish , ” says the trooper , shaking his head very <unk> , “ to break it myself and be <unk> as to advancing or <unk> by the way in which he seems to take it . ” As he evidently has a rooted feeling on this point , and as the <unk> of it is recognized in Mrs. Bagnet ’ s face , his mother <unk> her <unk> assent to what he asks .
For this he thanks her kindly .
“ In all other respects , my dear mother , I ’ ll be as <unk> and <unk> as you can wish ; on this one alone , I stand out .
So now I am ready even for the lawyers .
I have been drawing up , ” he glances at his writing on the table , “ an exact account of what I knew of the deceased and how I came to be involved in this unfortunate affair .
It ’ s entered , plain and regular , like an <unk> ; not a word in it but what ’ s wanted for the facts .
I did intend to read it , straight on end , <unk> I was called upon to say anything in my <unk> .
I hope I may be let to do it still ; but I have no longer a will of my own in this case , and whatever is said or done , I give my promise not to have any . ” <unk> being brought to this so far satisfactory pass , and time being on the <unk> , Mrs. Bagnet proposes a departure .
Again and again the old lady <unk> upon her son ’ s neck , and again and again the trooper holds her to his broad chest .
“ Where are you going to take my mother , Mrs. Bagnet ? ” “ I am going to the town house , my dear , the family house .
I have some business there that must be looked to directly , ” Mrs. Rouncewell answers .
“ Will you see my mother safe there in a coach , Mrs. Bagnet ?
But of course I know you will .
Why should I ask it ! ” Why indeed , Mrs. Bagnet expresses with the umbrella .
“ Take her , my old friend , and take my gratitude along with you .
<unk> to Quebec and Malta , love to my godson , a hearty shake of the hand to Lignum , and this for yourself , and I wish it was ten thousand pound in gold , my dear ! ” So saying , the trooper puts his lips to the old girl ’ s <unk> forehead , and the door shuts upon him in his <unk> .
No entreaties on the part of the good old housekeeper will induce Mrs. Bagnet to retain the coach for her own <unk> home .
<unk> out cheerfully at the door of the Dedlock mansion and <unk> Mrs. Rouncewell up the steps , the old girl shakes hands and <unk> off , arriving soon afterwards in the bosom of the Bagnet family and falling to washing the greens as if nothing had happened .
My Lady is in that room in which she held her last conference with the murdered man , and is sitting where she sat that night , and is looking at the spot where he stood upon the hearth <unk> her so leisurely , when a tap comes at the door .
Who is it ?
Mrs. Rouncewell .
What has brought Mrs. Rouncewell to town so unexpectedly ?
“ <unk> , my Lady .
<unk> trouble .
Oh , my Lady , may I beg a word with you ? ” What new occurrence is it that makes this tranquil old woman tremble so ?
<unk> happier than her Lady , as her Lady has often thought , why does she <unk> in this manner and look at her with such strange mistrust ?
“ What is the matter ?
Sit down and take your breath . ” “ Oh , my Lady , my Lady .
I have found my son — my youngest , who went away for a soldier so long ago .
And he is in prison . ” “ For debt ? ” “ Oh , no , my Lady ; I would have paid any debt , and joyful . ” “ For what is he in prison then ? ” “ <unk> with a murder , my Lady , of which he is as innocent as — as I am .
<unk> of the murder of Mr. Tulkinghorn . ” What does she mean by this look and this imploring gesture ?
Why does she come so close ?
What is the letter that she holds ?
“ Lady Dedlock , my dear Lady , my good Lady , my kind Lady !
You must have a heart to feel for me , you must have a heart to forgive me .
I was in this family before you were born .
I am devoted to it .
But think of my dear son <unk> accused . ” “ I do not <unk> him . ” “ No , my Lady , no .
But others do , and he is in prison and in danger .
Oh , Lady Dedlock , if you can say but a word to help to clear him , say it ! ” What <unk> can this be ?
What power does she suppose is in the person she <unk> to <unk> this <unk> suspicion , if it be <unk> ?
Her Lady ’ s handsome eyes regard her with astonishment , almost with fear .
“ My Lady , I came away last night from Chesney Wold to find my son in my old age , and the step upon the Ghost ’ s Walk was so constant and so solemn that I never heard the like in all these years .
Night after night , as it has fallen dark , the sound has echoed through your rooms , but last night it was <unk> .
And as it fell dark last night , my Lady , I got this letter . ” “ What letter is it ? ” “ Hush !
Hush ! ” The housekeeper looks round and answers in a frightened whisper , “ My Lady , I have not breathed a word of it , I don ’ t believe what ’ s written in it , I know it can ’ t be true , I am sure and certain that it is not true .
But my son is in danger , and you must have a heart to pity me .
If you know of anything that is not known to others , if you have any suspicion , if you have any clue at all , and any reason for keeping it in your own breast , oh , my dear Lady , think of me , and conquer that reason , and let it be known !
This is the most I consider possible .
I know you are not a hard lady , but you go your own way always without help , and you are not familiar with your friends ; and all who admire you — and all do — as a beautiful and elegant lady , know you to be one far away from themselves who can ’ t be approached close .
My Lady , you may have some proud or angry reasons for <unk> to utter something that you know ; if so , pray , oh , pray , think of a faithful servant whose whole life has been passed in this family which she dearly loves , and <unk> , and help to clear my son !
My Lady , my good Lady , ” the old housekeeper <unk> with genuine simplicity , “ I am so humble in my place and you are by nature so high and distant that you may not think what I feel for my child , but I feel so much that I have come here to make so bold as to beg and pray you not to be <unk> of us if you can do us any right or justice at this fearful time ! ” Lady Dedlock <unk> her without one word , until she takes the letter from her hand .
“ Am I to read this ? ” “ When I am gone , my Lady , if you please , and then remembering the most that I consider possible . ” “ I know of nothing I can do .
I know of nothing I reserve that can <unk> your son .
I have never accused him . ” “ My Lady , you may pity him the more under a false <unk> after reading the letter . ” The old housekeeper leaves her with the letter in her hand .
In truth she is not a hard lady naturally , and the time has been when the sight of the venerable figure <unk> to her with such strong earnestness would have moved her to great compassion .
But so long accustomed to <unk> emotion and keep down reality , so long <unk> for her own purposes in that <unk> school which shuts up the natural feelings of the heart like flies in <unk> and <unk> one uniform and dreary <unk> over the good and bad , the feeling and the <unk> , the sensible and the <unk> , she had subdued even her wonder until now .
She opens the letter .
<unk> out upon the paper is a printed account of the discovery of the body as it lay face downward on the floor , shot through the heart ; and underneath is written her own name , with the word “ <unk> ” attached .
It falls out of her hand .
How long it may have <unk> upon the ground she knows not , but it lies where it fell when a servant stands before her announcing the young man of the name of Guppy .
The words have probably been repeated several times , for they are ringing in her head before she begins to understand them .
“ Let him come in ! ” He comes in .
<unk> the letter in her hand , which she has taken from the floor , she tries to <unk> her thoughts .
In the eyes of Mr. Guppy she is the same Lady Dedlock , holding the same prepared , proud , <unk> state .
“ Your ladyship may not be at first disposed to excuse this visit from one who has never been welcome to your ladyship ” — which he don ’ t complain of , for he is bound to confess that there never has been any particular reason on the face of things why he should be — “ but I hope when I mention my motives to your ladyship you will not find fault with me , ” says Mr. Guppy .
“ Do so . ” “ Thank your ladyship .
I ought first to explain to your ladyship , ” Mr. Guppy sits on the <unk> of a chair and puts his hat on the carpet at his feet , “ that Miss Summerson , whose image , as I formerly mentioned to your ladyship , was at one period of my life imprinted on my ’ eart until <unk> by circumstances over which I had no control , communicated to me , after I had the pleasure of waiting on your ladyship last , that she particularly wished me to take no steps whatever in any manner at all <unk> to her .
And Miss Summerson ’ s wishes being to me a law ( except as connected with circumstances over which I have no control ) , I consequently never expected to have the distinguished honour of waiting on your ladyship again . ” And yet he is here now , Lady Dedlock moodily <unk> him .
“ And yet I am here now , ” Mr. Guppy admits .
“ My object being to communicate to your ladyship , under the seal of confidence , why I am here . ” He cannot do so , she tells him , too plainly or too briefly .
“ Nor can I , ” Mr. Guppy returns with a sense of injury upon him , “ too particularly request your ladyship to take particular notice that it ’ s no personal affair of mine that brings me here .
I have no interested views of my own to serve in coming here .
If it was not for my promise to Miss Summerson and my keeping of it sacred — I , in point of fact , shouldn ’ t have darkened these doors again , but should have seen ’ em further first . ” Mr. Guppy considers this a favourable moment for sticking up his hair with both hands .
“ Your ladyship will remember when I mention it that the last time I was here I run against a party very eminent in our profession and whose loss we all <unk> .
That party certainly did from that time apply himself to cutting in against me in a way that I will call sharp practice , and did make it , at every turn and point , extremely difficult for me to be sure that I hadn ’ t <unk> led up to something contrary to Miss Summerson ’ s wishes .
<unk> is no <unk> , but I may say for myself that I am not so bad a man of business neither . ” Lady Dedlock looks at him in stern inquiry .
Mr. Guppy immediately withdraws his eyes from her face and looks anywhere else .
“ Indeed , it has been made so hard , ” he goes on , “ to have any idea what that party was up to in <unk> with others that until the loss which we all <unk> I was <unk> — an expression which your ladyship , moving in the higher circles , will be so good as to consider <unk> to knocked over .
Small likewise — a name by which I refer to another party , a friend of mine that your ladyship is not acquainted with — got to be so close and <unk> that at times it wasn ’ t easy to keep one ’ s hands off his ’ <unk> .
However , what with the exertion of my humble <unk> , and what with the help of a mutual friend by the name of Mr. Tony Weevle ( who is of a high aristocratic turn and has your ladyship ’ s portrait always hanging up in his room ) , I have now reasons for an apprehension as to which I come to put your ladyship upon your guard .
First , will your ladyship allow me to ask you whether you have had any strange visitors this morning ?
I don ’ t mean fashionable visitors , but such visitors , for instance , as Miss Barbary ’ s old servant , or as a person without the use of his lower <unk> , carried upstairs <unk> to a <unk> ? ” “ No ! ” “ Then I assure your ladyship that such visitors have been here and have been received here .
Because I saw them at the door , and waited at the corner of the square till they came out , and took half an hour ’ s turn afterwards to avoid them . ” “ What have I to do with that , or what have you ?
I do not understand you .
What do you mean ? ” “ Your ladyship , I come to put you on your guard .
There may be no occasion for it .
Very well .
Then I have only done my best to keep my promise to Miss Summerson .
I strongly suspect ( from what Small has dropped , and from what we have <unk> out of him ) that those letters I was to have brought to your ladyship were not destroyed when I supposed they were .
That if there was anything to be blown upon , it IS blown upon .
That the visitors I have <unk> to have been here this morning to make money of it .
And that the money is made , or making . ” Mr. Guppy <unk> up his hat and rises .
“ Your ladyship , you know best whether there ’ s anything in what I say or whether there ’ s nothing .
Something or nothing , I have <unk> up to Miss Summerson ’ s wishes in letting things alone and in <unk> what I had begun to do , as far as possible ; that ’ s sufficient for me .
In case I should be taking a liberty in putting your ladyship on your guard when there ’ s no necessity for it , you will endeavour , I should hope , to <unk> my <unk> , and I shall endeavour to <unk> your <unk> .
I now take my farewell of your ladyship , and assure you that there ’ s no danger of your ever being waited on by me again . ” She scarcely <unk> these parting words by any look , but when he has been gone a little while , she rings her bell .
“ Where is Sir Leicester ? ” Mercury reports that he is at present shut up in the library alone .
“ Has Sir Leicester had any visitors this morning ? ” Several , on business .
Mercury proceeds to a description of them , which has been anticipated by Mr. Guppy .
<unk> ; he may go .
So !
All is broken down .
Her name is in these many <unk> , her husband knows his wrongs , her shame will be published — may be <unk> while she thinks about it — and in addition to the <unk> so long <unk> by her , so <unk> by him , she is <unk> by an <unk> <unk> as the <unk> of her enemy .
Her enemy he was , and she has often , often , often wished him dead .
Her enemy he is , even in his grave .
This dreadful <unk> comes upon her like a new <unk> at his <unk> hand .
And when she recalls how she was secretly at his door that night , and how she may be represented to have sent her favourite girl away so soon before merely to release herself from observation , she <unk> as if the <unk> ’ s hands were at her neck .
She has thrown herself upon the floor and lies with her hair all <unk> scattered and her face buried in the <unk> of a couch .
She rises up , hurries to and fro , <unk> herself down again , and <unk> and <unk> .
The horror that is upon her is <unk> .
If she really were the <unk> , it could hardly be , for the moment , more intense .
For as her murderous perspective , before the doing of the deed , however <unk> the precautions for its commission , would have been closed up by a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> figure , <unk> her from seeing any consequences beyond it ; and as those consequences would have <unk> in , in an <unk> <unk> , the moment the figure was laid low — which always happens when a murder is done ; so , now she sees that when he used to be on the watch before her , and she used to think , “ if some mortal <unk> would but fall on this old man and take him from my way ! ” it was but <unk> that all he held against her in his hand might be <unk> to the winds and <unk> in many places .
So , too , with the wicked relief she has felt in his death .
What was his death but the <unk> of a gloomy arch removed , and now the arch begins to fall in a thousand fragments , each crushing and <unk> <unk> !
Thus , a terrible impression <unk> upon and <unk> her that from this <unk> , living or dead — <unk> and imperturbable before her in his <unk> shape , or not more <unk> and imperturbable in his <unk> — there is no escape but in death .
<unk> , she flies .
The <unk> of her shame , her dread , remorse , and misery , <unk> her at its height ; and even her strength of <unk> is <unk> and <unk> away like a leaf before a mighty wind .
She hurriedly addresses these lines to her husband , <unk> , and leaves them on her table : If I am sought for , or accused of , his murder , believe that I am wholly innocent .
<unk> no other good of me , for I am innocent of nothing else that you have heard , or will hear , laid to my charge .
He prepared me , on that fatal night , for his <unk> of my <unk> to you .
After he had left me , I went out on pretence of walking in the garden where I sometimes walk , but really to follow him and make one last <unk> that he would not <unk> the dreadful suspense on which I have been <unk> by him , you do not know how long , but would <unk> strike next morning .
I found his house dark and silent .
I rang twice at his door , but there was no reply , and I came home .
I have no home left .
I will <unk> you no more .
May you , in your just <unk> , be able to forget the <unk> woman on whom you have <unk> a most generous devotion — who <unk> you only with a deeper shame than that with which she hurries from herself — and who writes this last <unk> .
She <unk> and dresses quickly , leaves all her <unk> and her money , listens , goes downstairs at a moment when the hall is empty , opens and shuts the great door , <unk> away in the shrill frosty wind .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> <unk> , as <unk> its high <unk> , the Dedlock town house stares at the other houses in the street of dismal grandeur and gives no outward sign of anything going wrong within .
<unk> rattle , doors are <unk> at , the world <unk> calls ; ancient <unk> with skeleton throats , and <unk> cheeks that have a rather <unk> bloom upon them seen by daylight , when indeed these fascinating creatures look like Death and the Lady <unk> together , <unk> the eyes of men .
<unk> from the <unk> <unk> come easily swinging carriages guided by <unk> <unk> in <unk> wigs , deep sunk into <unk> <unk> , and up behind mount <unk> Mercuries bearing sticks of state and wearing <unk> <unk> <unk> , a spectacle for the angels .
The Dedlock town house changes not <unk> , and hours pass before its <unk> <unk> is disturbed within .
But Volumnia the fair , being subject to the <unk> complaint of <unk> and finding that disorder <unk> her spirits with some <unk> , ventures at length to repair to the library for change of scene .
Her gentle tapping at the door producing no <unk> , she opens it and peeps in ; seeing no one there , takes possession .
The sprightly Dedlock is <unk> , in that <unk> city of the <unk> , Bath , to be <unk> by an <unk> curiosity which <unk> her on all convenient and inconvenient occasions to <unk> about with a golden glass at her eye , <unk> into objects of every description .
<unk> it is that she <unk> herself of the present opportunity of hovering over her kinsman ’ s letters and papers like a bird , taking a short <unk> at this document and a <unk> with her head on one side at that document , and hopping about from table to table with her glass at her eye in an inquisitive and restless manner .
In the course of these <unk> she <unk> over something , and turning her glass in that direction , sees her kinsman lying on the ground like a <unk> tree .
Volumnia ’ s pet little scream <unk> a considerable <unk> of reality from this surprise , and the house is quickly in <unk> .
<unk> tear up and down stairs , bells are violently rung , <unk> are sent for , and Lady Dedlock is sought in all directions , but not found .
Nobody has seen or heard her since she last rang her bell .
Her letter to Sir Leicester is discovered on her table , but it is doubtful yet whether he has not received another <unk> from another world <unk> to be personally answered , and all the living <unk> , and all the dead , are as one to him .
They lay him down upon his bed , and <unk> , and rub , and <unk> , and put <unk> to his head , and try every means of <unk> .
<unk> , the day has <unk> away , and it is night in his room before his <unk> breathing <unk> or his fixed eyes show any consciousness of the candle that is occasionally passed before them .
But when this change begins , it goes on ; and by and by he nods or moves his eyes or even his hand in <unk> that he hears and <unk> .
He fell down , this morning , a handsome stately gentleman , somewhat <unk> , but of a fine presence , and with a <unk> face .
He lies upon his bed , an aged man with <unk> cheeks , the <unk> shadow of himself .
His voice was rich and <unk> and he had so long been thoroughly persuaded of the weight and <unk> to mankind of any word he said that his words really had come to sound as if there were something in them .
But now he can only whisper , and what he whispers sounds like what it is — mere <unk> and <unk> .
His favourite and faithful housekeeper stands at his bedside .
It is the first act he <unk> , and he clearly <unk> pleasure from it .
After <unk> trying to make himself understood in speech , he makes signs for a pencil .
So <unk> that they cannot at first understand him ; it is his old housekeeper who makes out what he wants and brings in a slate .
After pausing for some time , he slowly <unk> upon it in a hand that is not his , “ Chesney Wold ? ” No , she tells him ; he is in London .
He was taken ill in the library this morning .
Right thankful she is that she happened to come to London and is able to attend upon him .
“ It is not an illness of any serious consequence , Sir Leicester .
You will be much better to-morrow , Sir Leicester .
All the gentlemen say so . ” This , with the tears <unk> down her fair old face .
After making a <unk> of the room and looking with particular attention all round the bed where the <unk> stand , he writes , “ My Lady . ” “ My Lady went out , Sir Leicester , before you were taken ill , and don ’ t know of your illness yet . ” He points again , in great agitation , at the two words .
They all try to quiet him , but he points again with increased agitation .
On their looking at one another , not knowing what to say , he takes the slate once more and writes “ My Lady .
For God ’ s sake , where ? ” And makes an imploring <unk> .
It is thought better that his old housekeeper should give him Lady Dedlock ’ s letter , the contents of which no one knows or can <unk> .
She opens it for him and puts it out for his <unk> .
Having read it twice by a great effort , he turns it down so that it shall not be seen and lies <unk> .
He passes into a kind of <unk> or into a <unk> , and it is an hour before he opens his eyes , <unk> on his faithful and attached old servant ’ s arm .
The <unk> know that he is best with her , and when not <unk> engaged about him , stand <unk> .
The slate comes into <unk> again , but the word he wants to write he cannot remember .
His anxiety , his <unk> , and affliction at this pass are <unk> to behold .
It seems as if he must go mad in the necessity he feels for haste and the <unk> under which he labours of expressing to do what or to fetch whom .
He has written the letter <unk> , and there stopped .
Of a sudden , in the height of his misery , he puts Mr. before it .
The old housekeeper suggests Bucket .
Thank heaven !
That ’ s his meaning .
Mr. Bucket is found to be downstairs , by appointment .
Shall he come up ?
There is no possibility of <unk> Sir Leicester ’ s burning wish to see him or the desire he <unk> to have the room cleared of every one but the housekeeper .
It is <unk> done , and Mr. Bucket appears .
Of all men upon earth , Sir Leicester seems fallen from his high estate to place his sole trust and reliance upon this man .
“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I ’ m sorry to see you like this .
I hope you ’ ll cheer up .
I ’ m sure you will , on account of the family credit . ” Sir Leicester puts her letter in his hands and looks <unk> in his face while he reads it .
A new intelligence comes into Mr. Bucket ’ s eye as he reads on ; with one hook of his finger , while that eye is still glancing over the words , he <unk> , “ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I understand you . ” Sir Leicester writes upon the slate .
“ <unk> forgiveness .
<unk> — ” Mr. Bucket stops his hand .
“ Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I ’ ll find her .
But my search after her must be begun out of hand .
Not a minute must be lost . ” With the quickness of thought , he follows Sir Leicester Dedlock ’ s look towards a little box upon a table .
“ Bring it here , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ?
Certainly .
<unk> it with one of these here keys ?
Certainly .
The <unk> key ?
TO be sure .
Take the notes out ?
So I will .
<unk> ’ em ?
That ’ s soon done .
<unk> and thirty ’ s fifty , and twenty ’ s seventy , and fifty ’ s one twenty , and forty ’ s one <unk> .
Take ’ em for expenses ?
That I ’ ll do , and render an account of course .
Don ’ t spare money ?
No I won ’ t . ” The <unk> and certainty of Mr. Bucket ’ s <unk> on all these heads is little short of <unk> .
Mrs. Rouncewell , who holds the light , is giddy with the <unk> of his eyes and hands as he starts up , furnished for his journey .
“ You ’ re George ’ s mother , old lady ; that ’ s about what you are , I believe ? ” says Mr. Bucket aside , with his hat already on and <unk> his coat .
“ Yes , sir , I am his distressed mother . ” “ So I thought , according to what he mentioned to me just now .
Well , then , I ’ ll tell you something .
You needn ’ t be distressed no more .
Your son ’ s all right .
Now , don ’ t you begin <unk> , because what you ’ ve got to do is to take care of Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and you won ’ t do that by crying .
As to your son , he ’ s all right , I tell you ; and he sends his loving duty , and hoping you ’ re the same .
He ’ s discharged honourable ; that ’ s about what HE is ; with no more <unk> on his character than there is on yours , and yours is a tidy one , I ’ <unk> <unk> a pound .
You may trust me , for I took your son .
He conducted himself in a game way , too , on that occasion ; and he ’ s a <unk> man , and you ’ re a <unk> old lady , and you ’ re a mother and son , the pair of you , as might be showed for <unk> in a <unk> .
Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , what you ’ ve trusted to me I ’ ll go through with .
Don ’ t you be afraid of my turning out of my way , right or left , or taking a sleep , or a <unk> , or a <unk> till I have found what I go in search of .
Say everything as is kind and <unk> on your part ?
Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I will .
And I wish you better , and these family affairs <unk> over — as , Lord , many other family affairs equally has been , and equally will be , to the end of time . ” With this <unk> , Mr. Bucket , buttoned up , goes quietly out , looking steadily before him as if he were already <unk> the night in <unk> of the <unk> .
His first step is to take himself to Lady Dedlock ’ s rooms and look all over them for any trifling indication that may help him .
The rooms are in darkness now ; and to see Mr. Bucket with a <unk> in his hand , holding it above his head and taking a sharp mental <unk> of the many delicate objects so curiously at <unk> with himself , would be to see a sight — which nobody <unk> see , as he is particular to lock himself in .
“ A <unk> <unk> , this , ” says Mr. Bucket , who feels in a manner <unk> up in his French by the blow of the morning .
“ <unk> have cost a sight of money .
<unk> articles to cut away from , these ; she must have been hard put to it ! ” <unk> and shutting <unk> and looking into <unk> and <unk> , he sees the reflection of himself in various mirrors , and <unk> <unk> .
“ One might suppose I was a-moving in the fashionable circles and getting myself up for <unk> ’ s , ” says Mr. Bucket .
“ I begin to think I must be a swell in the <unk> without knowing it . ” <unk> looking about , he has opened a <unk> little chest in an inner drawer .
His great hand , turning over some gloves which it can scarcely feel , they are so light and soft within it , comes upon a white handkerchief .
“ Hum !
Let ’ s have a look at YOU , ” says Mr. Bucket , putting down the light .
“ What should YOU be kept by yourself for ?
What ’ s YOUR <unk> ?
Are you her ladyship ’ s property , or somebody else ’ s ?
You ’ ve got a mark upon you somewheres or another , I suppose ? ” He finds it as he speaks , “ Esther Summerson . ” “ Oh ! ” says Mr. Bucket , pausing , with his finger at his ear .
“ Come , I ’ ll take YOU . ” He <unk> his observations as quietly and carefully as he has carried them on , leaves everything else <unk> as he found it , glides away after some five minutes in all , and passes into the street .
With a glance upward at the dimly lighted windows of Sir Leicester ’ s room , he sets off , <unk> , to the nearest <unk> , <unk> out the horse for his money , and directs to be driven to the shooting gallery .
Mr. Bucket does not claim to be a <unk> judge of horses , but he lays out a little money on the principal events in that line , and generally <unk> up his knowledge of the subject in the remark that when he sees a horse as can go , he knows him .
His knowledge is not at fault in the present instance .
<unk> over the stones at a dangerous pace , yet thoughtfully bringing his keen eyes to bear on every <unk> creature whom he passes in the midnight streets , and even on the lights in upper windows where people are going or gone to bed , and on all the <unk> that he rattles by , and alike on the heavy sky , and on the earth where the snow lies thin — for something may present itself to assist him , anywhere — he <unk> to his destination at such a speed that when he stops the horse half <unk> him in a cloud of <unk> .
“ <unk> him half a moment to <unk> him up , and I ’ ll be back . ” He runs up the long wooden entry and finds the trooper smoking his pipe .
“ I thought I should , George , after what you have gone through , my lad .
I haven ’ t a word to spare .
Now , honour !
All to save a woman .
Miss Summerson that was here when Gridley died — that was the name , I know — all right — where does she live ? ” The trooper has just come from there and gives him the address , near <unk> Street .
“ You won ’ t <unk> it , George .
Good night ! ” He is off again , with an impression of having seen Phil sitting by the frosty fire staring at him <unk> , and <unk> away again , and gets out in a cloud of <unk> again .
Mr. Jarndyce , the only person up in the house , is just going to bed , rises from his book on hearing the rapid ringing at the bell , and comes down to the door in his <unk> .
“ Don ’ t be alarmed , sir . ” In a moment his visitor is confidential with him in the hall , has shut the door , and stands with his hand upon the lock .
“ I ’ ve had the pleasure of seeing you before .
Inspector Bucket .
Look at that handkerchief , sir , Miss Esther Summerson ’ s .
<unk> it myself put away in a drawer of Lady Dedlock ’ s , quarter of an hour ago .
Not a moment to lose .
<unk> of life or death .
You know Lady Dedlock ? ” “ Yes . ” “ There has been a discovery there to-day .
Family affairs have come out .
Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , has had a fit — <unk> or <unk> — and couldn ’ t be brought to , and precious time has been lost .
Lady Dedlock disappeared this afternoon and left a letter for him that looks bad .
<unk> your eye over it .
Here it is ! ” Mr. Jarndyce , having read it , asks him what he thinks .
“ I don ’ t know .
It looks like <unk> .
<unk> , there ’ s more and more danger , every minute , of its drawing to that .
I ’ d give a hundred pound an hour to have got the start of the present time .
Now , Mr. Jarndyce , I am employed by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , to follow her and find her , to save her and take her his forgiveness .
I have money and full power , but I want something else .
I want Miss Summerson . ” Mr. Jarndyce in a troubled voice repeats , “ Miss Summerson ? ” “ Now , Mr. Jarndyce ” — Mr.
Bucket has read his face with the greatest attention all along — “ I speak to you as a gentleman of a <unk> heart , and under such pressing circumstances as don ’ t often happen .
If ever delay was dangerous , it ’ s dangerous now ; and if ever you couldn ’ t afterwards forgive yourself for <unk> it , this is the time .
<unk> or ten hours , worth , as I tell you , a hundred pound <unk> at least , have been lost since Lady Dedlock disappeared .
I am charged to find her .
I am Inspector Bucket .
Besides all the rest that ’ s heavy on her , she has upon her , as she believes , suspicion of murder .
If I follow her alone , she , being in ignorance of what Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , has communicated to me , may be driven to <unk> .
But if I follow her in company with a young lady , answering to the description of a young lady that she has a tenderness for — I ask no question , and I say no more than that — she will give me credit for being friendly .
Let me come up with her and be able to have the hold upon her of putting that young lady for ’ ard , and I ’ ll save her and <unk> with her if she is alive .
Let me come up with her alone — a hard matter — and I ’ ll do my best , but I don ’ t answer for what the best may be .
Time flies ; it ’ s getting on for one o ’ clock .
When one strikes , there ’ s another hour gone , and it ’ s worth a thousand pound now instead of a hundred . ” This is all true , and the pressing nature of the case cannot be <unk> .
Mr. Jarndyce begs him to remain there while he speaks to Miss Summerson .
Mr. Bucket says he will , but <unk> on his usual principle , does no such thing , following upstairs instead and keeping his man in sight .
So he remains , <unk> and <unk> about in the gloom of the staircase while they confer .
In a very little time Mr. Jarndyce comes down and tells him that Miss Summerson will join him directly and place herself under his protection to accompany him where he <unk> .
Mr. Bucket , satisfied , expresses high approval and <unk> her coming at the door .
There he <unk> a high tower in his mind and looks out far and wide .
Many solitary figures he perceives creeping through the streets ; many solitary figures out on <unk> , and roads , and lying under <unk> .
But the figure that he <unk> is not among them .
Other <unk> he perceives , in <unk> of bridges , looking over ; and in <unk> places down by the river ’ s level ; and a dark , dark , <unk> object <unk> with the <unk> , more solitary than all , <unk> with a <unk> hold on his attention .
Where is she ?
<unk> or dead , where is she ?
If , as he folds the handkerchief and carefully puts it up , it were able with an enchanted power to bring before him the place where she found it and the <unk> near the cottage where it covered the little child , would he <unk> her there ?
On the waste where the <unk> are burning with a pale blue <unk> , where the <unk> of the wretched <unk> in which the bricks are made are being scattered by the wind , where the <unk> and water are hard frozen and the mill in which the gaunt blind horse goes round all day looks like an instrument of human <unk> — <unk> this deserted , blighted spot there is a lonely figure with the sad world to itself , <unk> by the snow and driven by the wind , and cast out , it would seem , from all <unk> .
It is the figure of a woman , too ; but it is <unk> dressed , and no such clothes ever came through the hall and out at the great door of the Dedlock mansion .
CHAPTER <unk> Esther ’ s Narrative I had gone to bed and fallen asleep when my guardian knocked at the door of my room and begged me to get up directly .
On my <unk> to speak to him and learn what had happened , he told me , after a word or two of preparation , that there had been a discovery at Sir Leicester Dedlock ’ s .
That my mother had <unk> , that a person was now at our door who was <unk> to <unk> to her the <unk> assurances of affectionate protection and forgiveness if he could possibly find her , and that I was sought for to accompany him in the hope that my entreaties might <unk> upon her if his failed .
Something to this general purpose I made out , but I was thrown into such a <unk> of alarm , and hurry and distress , that in spite of every effort I could make to <unk> my agitation , I did not seem , to myself , fully to recover my right mind until hours had passed .
But I dressed and wrapped up <unk> without waking Charley or any one and went down to Mr. Bucket , who was the person <unk> with the secret .
In taking me to him my guardian told me this , and also explained how it was that he had come to think of me .
Mr. Bucket , in a low voice , by the light of my guardian ’ s candle , read to me in the hall a letter that my mother had left upon her table ; and I suppose within ten minutes of my having been aroused I was sitting beside him , rolling swiftly through the streets .
His manner was very keen , and yet considerate when he explained to me that a great deal might depend on my being able to answer , without confusion , a few questions that he wished to ask me .
These were , chiefly , whether I had had much communication with my mother ( to whom he only referred as Lady Dedlock ) , when and where I had spoken with her last , and how she had become possessed of my handkerchief .
When I had satisfied him on these points , he asked me particularly to consider — taking time to think — whether within my knowledge there was any one , no matter where , in whom she might be at all likely to confide under circumstances of the last necessity .
I could think of no one but my guardian .
But by and by I mentioned Mr. Boythorn .
He came into my mind as connected with his old <unk> manner of mentioning my mother ’ s name and with what my guardian had informed me of his engagement to her sister and his unconscious connexion with her unhappy story .
My companion had stopped the driver while we held this conversation , that we might the better hear each other .
He now told him to go on again and said to me , after considering within himself for a few moments , that he had made up his mind how to proceed .
He was quite willing to tell me what his plan was , but I did not feel clear enough to understand it .
We had not driven very far from our lodgings when we stopped in a <unk> at a <unk> place lighted up with gas .
Mr. Bucket took me in and sat me in an arm-chair by a bright fire .
It was now past one , as I saw by the clock against the wall .
Two police officers , looking in their perfectly neat uniform not at all like people who were up all night , were quietly writing at a desk ; and the place seemed very quiet altogether , except for some beating and calling out at distant doors <unk> , to which nobody paid any attention .
A third man in uniform , whom Mr. Bucket called and to whom he whispered his instructions , went out ; and then the two others advised together while one wrote from Mr. Bucket ’ s subdued <unk> .
It was a description of my mother that they were busy with , for Mr. Bucket brought it to me when it was done and read it in a whisper .
It was very <unk> indeed .
The second officer , who had attended to it closely , then copied it out and called in another man in uniform ( there were several in an outer room ) , who took it up and went away with it .
All this was done with the greatest dispatch and without the waste of a moment ; yet nobody was at all hurried .
As soon as the paper was sent out upon its <unk> , the two officers resumed their former quiet work of writing with <unk> and care .
Mr. Bucket thoughtfully came and warmed the <unk> of his boots , first one and then the other , at the fire .
“ Are you well wrapped up , Miss Summerson ? ” he asked me as his eyes met mine .
“ It ’ s a desperate sharp night for a young lady to be out in . ” I told him I cared for no weather and was <unk> <unk> .
“ It may be a long job , ” he observed ; “ but so that it ends well , never mind , miss . ” “ I pray to heaven it may end well ! ” said I.
He nodded <unk> .
“ You see , whatever you do , don ’ t you go and <unk> yourself .
You keep yourself cool and equal for anything that may happen , and it ’ ll be the better for you , the better for me , the better for Lady Dedlock , and the better for Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . ” He was really very kind and gentle , and as he stood before the fire <unk> his boots and rubbing his face with his forefinger , I felt a confidence in his <unk> which reassured me .
It was not yet a quarter to two when I heard horses ’ feet and wheels outside .
“ Now , Miss Summerson , ” said he , “ we are off , if you please ! ” He gave me his arm , and the two officers <unk> bowed me out , and we found at the door a <unk> or <unk> with a <unk> and post horses .
Mr. Bucket handed me in and took his own seat on the box .
The man in uniform whom he had sent to fetch this <unk> then handed him up a dark lantern at his request , and when he had given a few directions to the driver , we rattled away .
I was far from sure that I was not in a dream .
We rattled with great <unk> through such a <unk> of streets that I soon lost all idea where we were , except that we had crossed and <unk> the river , and still seemed to be <unk> a <unk> , <unk> , dense neighbourhood of narrow <unk> <unk> by <unk> and <unk> , high piles of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> of ships .
At length we stopped at the corner of a little <unk> turning , which the wind from the river , rushing up it , did not <unk> ; and I saw my companion , by the light of his lantern , in conference with several men who looked like a mixture of police and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> wall by which they stood , there was a bill , on which I could <unk> the words , “ <unk> <unk> ” ; and this and an inscription about <unk> possessed me with the awful suspicion <unk> forth in our visit to that place .
I had no need to remind myself that I was not there by the <unk> of any feeling of mine to <unk> the difficulties of the search , or to <unk> its hopes , or <unk> its <unk> .
I remained quiet , but what I suffered in that dreadful spot I never can forget .
And still it was like the horror of a dream .
A man yet dark and muddy , in long <unk> <unk> boots and a hat like them , was called out of a <unk> and whispered with Mr. Bucket , who went away with him down some <unk> steps — as if to look at something secret that he had to show .
They came back , wiping their hands upon their coats , after turning over something wet ; but thank God it was not what I feared !
After some further conference , Mr. Bucket ( whom everybody seemed to know and <unk> to ) went in with the others at a door and left me in the carriage , while the driver walked up and down by his horses to warm himself .
The <unk> was coming in , as I <unk> from the sound it made , and I could hear it break at the end of the <unk> with a little rush towards me .
It never did so — and I thought it did so , hundreds of times , in what can have been at the most a quarter of an hour , and probably was less — but the thought <unk> through me that it would cast my mother at the horses ’ feet .
Mr. Bucket came out again , <unk> the others to be <unk> , darkened his lantern , and once more took his seat .
“ Don ’ t you be alarmed , Miss Summerson , on account of our coming down here , ” he said , turning to me .
“ I only want to have everything in train and to know that it is in train by looking after it myself .
Get on , my lad ! ” We appeared to <unk> the way we had come .
Not that I had taken note of any particular objects in my <unk> state of mind , but judging from the general character of the streets .
We called at another office or station for a minute and crossed the river again .
During the whole of this time , and during the whole search , my companion , wrapped up on the box , never <unk> in his <unk> a single moment ; but when we crossed the bridge he seemed , if possible , to be more on the <unk> than before .
He stood up to look over the parapet , he alighted and went back after a shadowy female figure that <unk> past us , and he <unk> into the profound black pit of water with a face that made my heart die within me .
The river had a fearful look , so <unk> and secret , creeping away so fast between the low flat lines of shore — so heavy with indistinct and awful shapes , both of substance and shadow ; so <unk> and mysterious .
I have seen it many times since then , by sunlight and by moonlight , but never free from the impressions of that journey .
In my memory the lights upon the bridge are always burning dim , the cutting wind is <unk> round the <unk> woman whom we pass , the monotonous wheels are <unk> on , and the light of the <unk> reflected back looks <unk> in upon me — a face rising out of the <unk> water .
<unk> and <unk> through the empty streets , we came at length from the pavement on to dark smooth roads and began to leave the houses behind us .
After a while I recognized the familiar way to Saint Albans .
At <unk> fresh horses were ready for us , and we changed and went on .
It was very cold indeed , and the open country was white with snow , though none was falling then .
“ An old acquaintance of yours , this road , Miss Summerson , ” said Mr. Bucket cheerfully .
“ Yes , ” I returned .
“ Have you gathered any intelligence ? ” “ None that can be quite <unk> on as yet , ” he answered , “ but it ’ s early times as yet . ” He had gone into every late or early public-house where there was a light ( they were not a few at that time , the road being then much <unk> by <unk> ) and had got down to talk to the <unk> .
I had heard him <unk> drink , and <unk> money , and making himself agreeable and merry everywhere ; but whenever he took his seat upon the box again , his face resumed its watchful steady look , and he always said to the driver in the same business tone , “ Get on , my lad ! ” With all these <unk> , it was between five and six o ’ clock and we were yet a few miles short of Saint Albans when he came out of one of these houses and handed me in a cup of tea .
“ <unk> it , Miss Summerson , it ’ ll do you good .
You ’ re beginning to get more yourself now , ain ’ t you ? ” I thanked him and said I hoped so .
“ You was what you may call <unk> at first , ” he returned ; “ and Lord , no wonder !
Don ’ t speak loud , my dear .
It ’ s all right .
She ’ s on <unk> . ” I don ’ t know what joyful exclamation I made or was going to make , but he put up his finger and I stopped myself .
“ <unk> through here on foot this evening about eight or nine .
I heard of her first at the archway <unk> , over at <unk> , but couldn ’ t make quite sure .
<unk> her all along , on and off .
<unk> her up at one place , and dropped her at another ; but she ’ s before us now , safe .
Take hold of this cup and <unk> , <unk> .
Now , if you wasn ’ t brought up to the butter trade , look out and see if you can catch half a crown in your t ’ other hand .
One , two , three , and there you are !
Now , my lad , try a <unk> ! ” We were soon in Saint Albans and alighted a little before day , when I was just beginning to arrange and comprehend the occurrences of the night and really to believe that they were not a dream .
Leaving the carriage at the <unk> and <unk> fresh horses to be ready , my companion gave me his arm , and we went towards home .
“ As this is your regular <unk> , Miss Summerson , you see , ” he observed , “ I should like to know whether you ’ ve been asked for by any stranger answering the description , or whether Mr. Jarndyce has .
I don ’ t much expect it , but it might be . ” As we <unk> the hill , he looked about him with a sharp eye — the day was now breaking — and reminded me that I had come down it one night , as I had reason for remembering , with my little servant and poor Jo , whom he called Toughey .
I wondered how he knew that .
“ When you passed a man upon the road , just yonder , you know , ” said Mr. Bucket .
Yes , I remembered that too , very well .
“ That was me , ” said Mr. Bucket .
<unk> my surprise , he went on , “ I drove down in a gig that afternoon to look after that boy .
You might have heard my wheels when you came out to look after him yourself , for I was aware of you and your little maid going up when I was walking the horse down .
<unk> an inquiry or two about him in the town , I soon heard what company he was in and was coming among the <unk> to look for him when I observed you bringing him home here . ” “ <unk> he committed any crime ? ” I asked .
“ None was charged against him , ” said Mr. Bucket , coolly lifting off his hat , “ but I suppose he wasn ’ t <unk> .
No .
What I wanted him for was in connexion with keeping this very matter of Lady Dedlock quiet .
He had been making his tongue more free than welcome as to a small accidental service he had been paid for by the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn ; and it wouldn ’ t do , at any sort of price , to have him playing those games .
So having <unk> him out of London , I made an afternoon of it to warn him to keep out of it now he WAS away , and go farther from it , and maintain a bright <unk> that I didn ’ t catch him coming back again . ” “ Poor creature ! ” said I.
“ Poor enough , ” assented Mr. Bucket , “ and trouble enough , and well enough away from London , or anywhere else .
I was regularly turned on my back when I found him taken up by your establishment , I do assure you . ” I asked him why .
“ Why , my dear ? ” said Mr. Bucket .
“ <unk> there was no end to his tongue then .
He might as well have been born with a yard and a half of it , and a <unk> over . ” Although I remember this conversation now , my head was in confusion at the time , and my power of attention hardly did more than <unk> me to understand that he entered into these particulars to <unk> me .
With the same kind intention , <unk> , he often spoke to me of indifferent things , while his face was busy with the one object that we had in view .
He still pursued this subject as we turned in at the <unk> .
“ Ah ! ” said Mr. Bucket .
“ Here we are , and a nice retired place it is .
<unk> a man in mind of the country house in the <unk> , that was known by the smoke which so <unk> <unk> .
They ’ re early with the kitchen fire , and that <unk> good servants .
But what you ’ ve always got to be careful of with servants is who comes to see ’ em ; you never know what they ’ re up to if you don ’ t know that .
And another thing , my dear .
Whenever you find a young man behind the <unk> , you give that young man in charge on suspicion of being <unk> in a <unk> with an <unk> purpose . ” We were now in front of the house ; he looked attentively and closely at the <unk> for <unk> before he raised his eyes to the windows .
“ Do you generally put that <unk> young gentleman in the same room when he ’ s on a visit here , Miss Summerson ? ” he inquired , glancing at Mr. Skimpole ’ s usual chamber .
“ You know Mr. Skimpole ! ” said I.
“ What do you call him again ? ” returned Mr. Bucket , bending down his ear .
“ Skimpole , is it ?
I ’ ve often wondered what his name might be .
Skimpole .
Not John , I should say , nor yet <unk> ? ” “ Harold , ” I told him .
“ Harold .
Yes .
He ’ s a queer bird is Harold , ” said Mr. Bucket , eyeing me with great expression .
“ He is a singular character , ” said I.
“ No idea of money , ” observed Mr. Bucket .
“ He takes it , though ! ” I <unk> returned for answer that I perceived Mr. Bucket knew him .
“ Why , now I ’ ll tell you , Miss Summerson , ” he replied .
“ Your mind will be all the better for not running on one point too continually , and I ’ ll tell you for a change .
It was him as pointed out to me where Toughey was .
I made up my mind that night to come to the door and ask for Toughey , if that was all ; but willing to try a move or so first , if any such was on the board , I just <unk> up a morsel of <unk> at that window where I saw a shadow .
As soon as Harold opens it and I have had a look at him , thinks I , you ’ re the man for me .
So I <unk> him down a bit about not wanting to disturb the family after they was gone to bed and about its being a thing to be regretted that charitable young ladies should <unk> <unk> ; and then , when I pretty well understood his ways , I said I should consider a <unk> well bestowed if I could <unk> the premises of Toughey without <unk> any noise or trouble .
Then says he , lifting up his eyebrows in the <unk> way , ‘ It ’ s no use mentioning a <unk> to me , my friend , because I ’ m a mere child in such matters and have no idea of money . ’ Of course I understood what his taking it so easy meant ; and being now quite sure he was the man for me , I wrapped the note round a little stone and threw it up to him .
Well !
He laughs and <unk> , and looks as innocent as you like , and says , ‘ But I don ’ t know the value of these things .
What am I to DO with this ? ’ ‘ <unk> it , sir , ’ says I.
‘ But I shall be taken in , ’ he says , ‘ they won ’ t give me the right change , I shall lose it , it ’ s no use to me . ’ Lord , you never saw such a face as he carried it with !
Of course he told me where to find Toughey , and I found him . ” I regarded this as very <unk> on the part of Mr. Skimpole towards my guardian and as passing the usual <unk> of his childish innocence .
“ <unk> , my dear ? ” returned Mr. Bucket .
“ <unk> ?
Now , Miss Summerson , I ’ ll give you a piece of advice that your husband will find useful when you are happily married and have got a family about you .
Whenever a person says to you that they are as innocent as can be in all concerning money , look well after your own money , for they are dead certain to collar it if they can .
Whenever a person <unk> to you ‘ In worldly matters I ’ m a child , ’ you consider that that person is only <unk> off from being held <unk> and that you have got that person ’ s number , and it ’ s <unk> One .
Now , I am not a <unk> man myself , except in a <unk> way when it goes round a company , but I ’ m a practical one , and that ’ s my experience .
So ’ s this <unk> .
<unk> and loose in one thing , fast and loose in everything .
I never knew it fail .
No more will you .
Nor no one .
With which caution to the <unk> , my dear , I take the liberty of pulling this here bell , and so go back to our business . ” I believe it had not been for a moment out of his mind , any more than it had been out of my mind , or out of his face .
The whole household were amazed to see me , without any notice , at that time in the morning , and so accompanied ; and their surprise was not <unk> by my inquiries .
No one , however , had been there .
It could not be doubted that this was the truth .
“ Then , Miss Summerson , ” said my companion , “ we can ’ t be too soon at the cottage where those <unk> are to be found .
Most inquiries there I leave to you , if you ’ ll be so good as to make ’ em .
The <unk> way is the best way , and the <unk> way is your own way . ” We set off again immediately .
On arriving at the cottage , we found it shut up and apparently deserted , but one of the neighbours who knew me and who came out when I was trying to make some one hear informed me that the two women and their husbands now lived together in another house , made of loose rough bricks , which stood on the <unk> of the piece of ground where the <unk> were and where the long rows of bricks were drying .
We lost no time in <unk> to this place , which was within a few hundred yards ; and as the door stood <unk> , I pushed it open .
There were only three of them sitting at breakfast , the child lying asleep on a bed in the corner .
It was Jenny , the mother of the dead child , who was absent .
The other woman rose on seeing me ; and the men , though they were , as usual , sulky and silent , each gave me a <unk> nod of recognition .
A look passed between them when Mr. Bucket followed me in , and I was surprised to see that the woman evidently knew him .
I had asked leave to enter of course .
Liz ( the only name by which I knew her ) rose to give me her own chair , but I sat down on a stool near the fire , and Mr. Bucket took a corner of the bedstead .
Now that I had to speak and was among people with whom I was not familiar , I became conscious of being hurried and giddy .
It was very difficult to begin , and I could not help bursting into tears .
“ Liz , ” said I , “ I have come a long way in the night and through the snow to inquire after a lady — ” “ Who has been here , you know , ” Mr. Bucket struck in , addressing the whole <unk> with a composed <unk> face ; “ that ’ s the lady the young lady means .
The lady that was here last night , you know . ” “ And who told YOU as there was anybody here ? ” inquired Jenny ’ s husband , who had made a <unk> stop in his eating to listen and now <unk> him with his eye .
“ A person of the name of <unk> <unk> , with a blue <unk> waistcoat with a double row of mother of pearl buttons , ” Mr. Bucket immediately answered .
“ He had as good mind his own business , <unk> he is , ” <unk> the man .
“ He ’ s out of employment , I believe , ” said Mr. Bucket <unk> for <unk> <unk> , “ and so gets talking . ” The woman had not resumed her chair , but stood <unk> with her hand upon its broken back , looking at me .
I thought she would have spoken to me <unk> if she had dared .
She was still in this attitude of <unk> when her husband , who was eating with a <unk> of bread and fat in one hand and his <unk> in the other , struck the handle of his knife violently on the table and told her with an oath to mind HER own business at any rate and sit down .
“ I should like to have seen Jenny very much , ” said I , “ for I am sure she would have told me all she could about this lady , whom I am very anxious indeed — you cannot think how anxious — to <unk> .
Will Jenny be here soon ?
Where is she ? ” The woman had a great desire to answer , but the man , with another oath , openly <unk> at her foot with his heavy <unk> .
He left it to Jenny ’ s husband to say what he <unk> , and after a <unk> silence the latter turned his <unk> head towards me .
“ I ’ m not partial to <unk> coming into my place , as you ’ ve heerd me say afore now , I think , miss .
I let their places be , and it ’ s curious they can ’ t let my place be .
There ’ d be a pretty shine made if I was to go <unk> <unk> , I think .
<unk> , I don ’ t so much complain of you as of some others , and I ’ m agreeable to make you a <unk> answer , though I give notice that I ’ m not a-going to be <unk> like a <unk> .
Will Jenny be here soon ?
No she won ’ t .
Where is she ?
She ’ s gone up to <unk> . ” “ Did she go last night ? ” I asked .
“ Did she go last night ?
Ah !
She went last night , ” he answered with a sulky <unk> of his head .
“ But was she here when the lady came ?
And what did the lady say to her ?
And where is the lady gone ?
I beg and pray you to be so kind as to tell me , ” said I , “ for I am in great distress to know . ” “ If my master would let me speak , and not say a word of harm — ” the woman timidly began .
“ Your master , ” said her husband , muttering an <unk> with slow emphasis , “ will break your neck if you <unk> with wot don ’ t concern you . ” After another silence , the husband of the absent woman , turning to me again , answered me with his usual <unk> <unk> .
“ <unk> Jenny here when the lady come ?
Yes , she wos here when the lady come .
<unk> did the lady say to her ?
Well , I ’ ll tell you wot the lady said to her .
She said , ‘ You remember me as come one time to talk to you about the young lady as had been <unk> of you ?
You remember me as give you <unk> handsome for a <unk> wot she had left ? ’ Ah , she remembered .
So we all did .
Well , then , wos that young lady up at the house now ?
No , she warn ’ t up at the house now .
Well , then , <unk> here .
The lady was upon a journey all alone , strange as we might think it , and could she rest herself where you ’ re a <unk> for a hour or so .
Yes she could , and so she did .
Then she went — it might be at twenty minutes past eleven , and it might be at twenty minutes past twelve ; we ain ’ t got no watches here to know the time by , nor yet clocks .
Where did she go ?
I don ’ t know where she go ’ d .
She went one way , and Jenny went another ; one went right to <unk> , and t ’ other went right from it .
That ’ s all about it .
Ask this man .
He heerd it all , and see it all .
He knows . ” The other man repeated , “ That ’ s all about it . ” “ Was the lady crying ? ” I inquired .
“ <unk> a bit , ” returned the first man .
“ Her shoes was the worse , and her clothes was the worse , but she warn ’ t — not as I see . ” The woman sat with her arms crossed and her eyes upon the ground .
Her husband had turned his seat a little so as to face her and kept his <unk> hand upon the table as if it were in <unk> to execute his <unk> if she <unk> him .
“ I hope you will not object to my asking your wife , ” said I , “ how the lady looked . ” “ Come , then ! ” he <unk> cried to her .
“ You hear what she says .
<unk> it short and tell her . ” “ <unk> , ” replied the woman .
“ <unk> and exhausted .
Very bad . ” “ Did she speak much ? ” “ Not much , but her voice was <unk> . ” She answered , looking all the while at her husband for leave .
“ Was she faint ? ” said I.
“ Did she eat or drink here ? ” “ Go on ! ” said the husband in answer to her look .
“ Tell her and cut it short . ” “ She had a little water , miss , and Jenny fetched her some bread and tea .
But she hardly touched it . ” “ And when she went from here , ” I was proceeding , when Jenny ’ s husband <unk> took me up .
“ When she went from here , she went right away nor ’ ard by the high road .
Ask on the road if you doubt me , and see if it warn ’ t so .
Now , there ’ s the end .
That ’ s all about it . ” I glanced at my companion , and finding that he had already risen and was ready to depart , thanked them for what they had told me , and took my leave .
The woman looked full at Mr. Bucket as he went out , and he looked full at her .
“ Now , Miss Summerson , ” he said to me as we walked quickly away .
“ They ’ ve got her ladyship ’ s watch among ’ em .
That ’ s a positive fact . ” “ You saw it ? ” I exclaimed .
“ Just as good as saw it , ” he returned .
“ <unk> why should he talk about his ‘ twenty minutes past ’ and about his having no watch to tell the time by ?
<unk> minutes !
He don ’ t usually cut his time so fine as that .
If he comes to <unk> , it ’ s as much as HE does .
Now , you see , either her ladyship gave him that watch or he took it .
I think she gave it him .
Now , what should she give it him for ?
What should she give it him for ? ” He repeated this question to himself several times as we hurried on , appearing to balance between a variety of answers that arose in his mind .
“ If time could be spared , ” said Mr. Bucket , “ which is the only thing that can ’ t be spared in this case , I might get it out of that woman ; but it ’ s too doubtful a chance to trust to under present circumstances .
They are up to keeping a close eye upon her , and any fool knows that a poor <unk> like her , beaten and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> from head to foot , will stand by the husband that ill uses her through thick and thin .
There ’ s something kept back .
It ’ s a pity but what we had seen the other woman . ” I regretted it exceedingly , for she was very grateful , and I felt sure would have <unk> no entreaty of mine .
“ It ’ s possible , Miss Summerson , ” said Mr. Bucket , pondering on it , “ that her ladyship sent her up to London with some word for you , and it ’ s possible that her husband got the watch to let her go .
It don ’ t come out altogether so plain as to please me , but it ’ s on the cards .
Now , I don ’ t take kindly to laying out the money of Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , on these <unk> , and I don ’ t see my way to the <unk> of it at present .
No !
So far our road , Miss Summerson , is for ’ ard — straight <unk> — and keeping everything quiet ! ” We called at home once more that I might send a hasty note to my guardian , and then we hurried back to where we had left the carriage .
The horses were brought out as soon as we were seen coming , and we were on the road again in a few minutes .
It had set in <unk> at <unk> , and it now <unk> hard .
The air was so thick with the darkness of the day and the <unk> of the fall that we could see but a very little way in any direction .
Although it was extremely cold , the snow was but <unk> frozen , and it <unk> — with a sound as if it were a <unk> of small <unk> — under the <unk> of the horses into mire and water .
They sometimes slipped and <unk> for a mile together , and we were obliged to come to a <unk> to rest them .
One horse fell three times in this first stage , and trembled so and was so shaken that the driver had to <unk> from his <unk> and lead him at last .
I could eat nothing and could not sleep , and I grew so nervous under those <unk> and the slow pace at which we <unk> that I had an unreasonable desire upon me to get out and walk .
<unk> to my companion ’ s better sense , however , I remained where I was .
All this time , kept fresh by a certain enjoyment of the work in which he was engaged , he was up and down at every house we came to , addressing people whom he had never beheld before as old <unk> , running in to warm himself at every fire he saw , talking and drinking and shaking hands at every bar and tap , friendly with every waggoner , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , yet never seeming to lose time , and always <unk> to the box again with his watchful , steady face and his business-like “ Get on , my lad ! ” When we were changing horses the next time , he came from the <unk> , with the wet snow <unk> upon him and <unk> off him — <unk> and <unk> through it to his wet knees as he had been doing frequently since we left Saint Albans — and spoke to me at the carriage side .
“ <unk> up your spirits .
It ’ s certainly true that she came on here , Miss Summerson .
There ’ s not a doubt of the dress by this time , and the dress has been seen here . ” “ Still on foot ? ” said I.
“ Still on foot .
I think the gentleman you mentioned must be the point she ’ s <unk> at , and yet I don ’ t like his living down in her own part of the country neither . ” “ I know so little , ” said I.
“ There may be some one else nearer here , of whom I never heard . ” “ That ’ s true .
But whatever you do , don ’ t you fall <unk> , my dear ; and don ’ t you <unk> yourself no more than you can help .
Get on , my lad ! ” The sleet fell all that day <unk> , a thick mist came on early , and it never rose or <unk> for a moment .
Such roads I had never seen .
I sometimes feared we had missed the way and got into the <unk> grounds or the marshes .
If I ever thought of the time I had been out , it presented itself as an <unk> period of great <unk> , and I seemed , in a strange way , never to have been free from the anxiety under which I then laboured .
As we advanced , I began to feel <unk> that my companion lost confidence .
He was the same as before with all the <unk> people , but he looked <unk> when he sat by himself on the box .
I saw his finger <unk> going across and across his mouth during the whole of one long weary stage .
I overheard that he began to ask the <unk> of <unk> and other vehicles coming towards us what passengers they had seen in other <unk> and vehicles that were in advance .
Their replies did not encourage him .
He always gave me a <unk> <unk> of his finger and lift of his <unk> as he got upon the box again , but he seemed perplexed now when he said , “ Get on , my lad ! ” At last , when we were changing , he told me that he had lost the track of the dress so long that he began to be surprised .
It was nothing , he said , to lose such a track for one while , and to take it up for another while , and so on ; but it had disappeared here in an unaccountable manner , and we had not come upon it since .
This <unk> the <unk> I had formed , when he began to look at <unk> , and to leave the carriage at cross roads for a quarter of an hour at a time while he <unk> them .
But I was not to be <unk> , he told me , for it was as likely as not that the next stage might set us right again .
The next stage , however , ended as that one ended ; we had no new clue .
There was a <unk> inn here , solitary , but a comfortable <unk> building , and as we drove in under a large gateway before I knew it , where a <unk> and her pretty daughters came to the <unk> , <unk> me to <unk> and <unk> myself while the horses were making ready , I thought it would be <unk> to refuse .
They took me upstairs to a warm room and left me there .
It was at the corner of the house , I remember , looking two ways .
On one side to a <unk> open to a <unk> , where the <unk> were <unk> the <unk> and tired horses from the muddy carriage , and beyond that to the <unk> itself , across which the sign was heavily swinging ; on the other side to a wood of dark <unk> .
Their branches were <unk> with snow , and it silently dropped off in wet heaps while I stood at the window .
Night was setting in , and its <unk> was <unk> by the contrast of the <unk> fire glowing and <unk> in the <unk> .
As I looked among the <unk> of the trees and followed the discoloured marks in the snow where the <unk> was sinking into it and <unk> it , I thought of the motherly face brightly set off by daughters that had just now <unk> me and of MY mother lying down in such a wood to die .
I was frightened when I found them all about me , but I remembered that before I <unk> I tried very hard not to do it ; and that was some little comfort .
They <unk> me up on a large sofa by the fire , and then the <unk> <unk> told me that I must travel no further to-night , but must go to bed .
But this put me into such a tremble lest they should <unk> me there that she soon recalled her words and <unk> for a rest of half an hour .
A good endearing creature she was .
She and her three fair girls , all so busy about me .
I was to take hot <unk> and <unk> <unk> , while Mr. Bucket dried himself and <unk> elsewhere ; but I could not do it when a <unk> round table was presently spread by the fireside , though I was very unwilling to <unk> them .
However , I could take some toast and some hot <unk> ; and as I really enjoyed that refreshment , it made some <unk> .
<unk> to the time , at the half-hour ’ s end the carriage came <unk> under the gateway , and they took me down , warmed , refreshed , <unk> by kindness , and safe ( I assured them ) not to faint any more .
After I had got in and had taken a grateful leave of them all , the youngest daughter — a blooming girl of <unk> , who was to be the first married , they had told me — got upon the carriage step , reached in , and kissed me .
I have never seen her , from that hour , but I think of her to this hour as my friend .
The <unk> windows with the fire and light , looking so bright and warm from the cold darkness out of doors , were soon gone , and again we were crushing and <unk> the loose snow .
We went on with <unk> enough , but the dismal roads were not much worse than they had been , and the stage was only nine miles .
My companion smoking on the box — I had thought at the last inn of begging him to do so when I saw him standing at a great fire in a comfortable cloud of tobacco — was as <unk> as ever and as quickly down and up again when we came to any human <unk> or any human creature .
He had lighted his little dark lantern , which seemed to be a favourite with him , for we had lamps to the carriage ; and every now and then he turned it upon me to see that I was doing well .
There was a <unk> to the <unk> , but I never closed it , for it seemed like shutting out hope .
We came to the end of the stage , and still the lost trace was not recovered .
I looked at him anxiously when we stopped to change , but I knew by his yet <unk> face as he stood watching the <unk> that he had heard nothing .
<unk> in an instant afterwards , as I leaned back in my seat , he looked in , with his lighted lantern in his hand , an excited and quite different man .
“ What is it ? ” said I , starting .
“ Is she here ? ” “ No , no .
Don ’ t deceive yourself , my dear .
Nobody ’ s here .
But I ’ ve got it ! ” The <unk> snow was in his <unk> , in his hair , lying in <unk> on his dress .
He had to shake it from his face and get his breath before he spoke to me .
“ Now , Miss Summerson , ” said he , beating his finger on the apron , “ don ’ t you be disappointed at what I ’ m a-going to do .
You know me .
I ’ m Inspector Bucket , and you can trust me .
We ’ ve come a long way ; never mind .
<unk> horses out there for the next stage up !
<unk> ! ” There was a <unk> in the yard , and a man came running out of the stables to know if he meant up or down .
“ Up , I tell you !
Up !
Ain ’ t it English ?
Up ! ” “ Up ? ” said I , astonished .
“ To London !
Are we going back ? ” “ Miss Summerson , ” he answered , “ back .
<unk> back as a die .
You know me .
Don ’ t be afraid .
I ’ ll follow the other , by <unk> — — ” “ The other ? ” I repeated .
“ Who ? ” “ You called her Jenny , didn ’ t you ?
I ’ ll follow her .
Bring those two pair out here for a crown a man .
<unk> up , some of you ! ” “ You will not desert this lady we are in search of ; you will not abandon her on such a night and in such a state of mind as I know her to be in ! ” said I , in an agony , and <unk> his hand .
“ You are right , my dear , I won ’ t .
But I ’ ll follow the other .
Look alive here with them horses .
<unk> a man for ’ ard in the <unk> to the next stage , and let him send another for ’ ard again , and order four on , up , right through .
My darling , don ’ t you be afraid ! ” These orders and the way in which he ran about the yard <unk> them caused a general excitement that was scarcely less <unk> to me than the sudden change .
But in the height of the confusion , a <unk> man <unk> away to order the <unk> , and our horses were put to with great speed .
“ My dear , ” said Mr. Bucket , <unk> to his seat and looking in again , “ — you ’ ll excuse me if I ’ m too familiar — don ’ t you <unk> and <unk> yourself no more than you can help .
I say nothing else at present ; but you know me , my dear ; now , don ’ t you ? ” I <unk> to say that I knew he was far more capable than I of <unk> what we ought to do , but was he sure that this was right ?
Could I not go forward by myself in search of — I <unk> his hand again in my distress and whispered it to him — of my own mother .
“ My dear , ” he answered , “ I know , I know , and would I put you wrong , do you think ?
Inspector Bucket .
Now you know me , don ’ t you ? ” What could I say but yes !
“ Then you keep up as good a heart as you can , and you rely upon me for standing by you , no less than by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet .
Now , are you right there ? ” “ All right , sir ! ” “ <unk> she goes , then .
And get on , my <unk> ! ” We were again upon the melancholy road by which we had come , tearing up the <unk> sleet and <unk> snow as if they were torn up by a <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> A <unk> Day and Night Still <unk> , as <unk> its <unk> , the Dedlock town house carries itself as usual towards the street of dismal grandeur .
There are <unk> heads from time to time in the little windows of the hall , looking out at the <unk> powder falling all day from the sky ; and in the same <unk> there is <unk> <unk> turning itself <unk> to the great hall fire from the <unk> weather out of doors .
It is given out that my Lady has gone down into Lincolnshire , but is expected to return presently .
<unk> , busy <unk> , however , will not go down into Lincolnshire .
It <unk> in <unk> and chattering about town .
It knows that that poor unfortunate man , Sir Leicester , has been <unk> used .
It hears , my dear child , all sorts of shocking things .
It makes the world of five miles round quite merry .
Not to know that there is something wrong at the Dedlocks ’ is to <unk> yourself unknown .
One of the <unk> <unk> with the skeleton throats is already <unk> of all the principal circumstances that will come out before the <unk> on Sir Leicester ’ s application for a bill of <unk> .
At <unk> and <unk> ’ s the <unk> and at Sheen and Gloss ’ s the <unk> , it is and will be for several hours the <unk> of the age , the feature of the century .
The <unk> of those <unk> , <unk> so <unk> <unk> , being as <unk> <unk> and <unk> there as any other article of the <unk> , are perfectly understood in this new fashion by the <unk> hand behind the counter .
“ Our people , Mr. <unk> , ” said <unk> and <unk> to the hand in question on engaging him , “ our people , sir , are sheep — mere sheep .
Where two or three marked ones go , all the rest follow .
<unk> those two or three in your eye , Mr. <unk> , and you have the <unk> . ” So , likewise , Sheen and Gloss to THEIR <unk> , in reference to knowing where to have the fashionable people and how to bring what they ( Sheen and Gloss ) choose into fashion .
On similar <unk> principles , Mr. Sladdery the <unk> , and indeed the great <unk> of <unk> sheep , admits this very day , “ Why yes , sir , there certainly ARE reports concerning Lady Dedlock , very <unk> indeed among my high connexion , sir .
You see , my high connexion must talk about something , sir ; and it ’ s only to get a subject into <unk> with one or two ladies I could name to make it go down with the whole .
Just what I should have done with those ladies , sir , in the case of any novelty you had left to me to bring in , they have done of themselves in this case through knowing Lady Dedlock and being perhaps a little innocently jealous of her too , sir .
You ’ ll find , sir , that this <unk> will be very popular among my high connexion .
If it had been a speculation , sir , it would have brought money .
And when I say so , you may trust to my being right , sir , for I have made it my business to study my high connexion and to be able to wind it up like a clock , sir . ” Thus <unk> <unk> in the capital , and will not go down into Lincolnshire .
By half-past five , post <unk> , <unk> <unk> ’ time , it has even <unk> a new remark from the Honourable Mr. Stables , which <unk> fair to <unk> the old one , on which he has so long rested his <unk> reputation .
This sparkling <unk> is to the effect that although he always knew she was the <unk> woman in the <unk> , he had no idea she was a <unk> .
It is <unk> received in <unk> .
At <unk> and <unk> also , in <unk> she has often <unk> , and among <unk> she <unk> but yesterday , she is still the <unk> subject .
What is it ?
Who is it ?
When was it ?
Where was it ?
How was it ?
She is discussed by her dear friends with all the <unk> <unk> in <unk> , with the last new word , the last new manner , the last new <unk> , and the perfection of polite indifference .
A remarkable feature of the theme is that it is found to be so <unk> that several people come out upon it who never came out before — positively say things !
William Buffy carries one of these <unk> from the place where he <unk> down to the House , where the <unk> for his party hands it about with his <unk> to keep men together who want to be off , with such effect that the <unk> ( who has had it <unk> <unk> into his own ear under the corner of his wig ) cries , “ <unk> at the bar ! ” three times without making an impression .
And not the least <unk> circumstance connected with her being <unk> the town talk is that people hovering on the <unk> of Mr. Sladdery ’ s high connexion , people who know nothing and ever did know nothing about her , think it essential to their reputation to pretend that she is their <unk> too , and to <unk> her at second-hand with the last new word and the last new manner , and the last new <unk> , and the last new polite indifference , and all the rest of it , all at second-hand but considered equal to new in <unk> <unk> and to <unk> stars .
If there be any man of letters , art , or science among these little <unk> , how noble in him to support the feeble sisters on such majestic <unk> !
So goes the wintry day outside the Dedlock mansion .
How within it ?
Sir Leicester , lying in his bed , can speak a little , though with difficulty and <unk> .
He is <unk> to silence and to rest , and they have given him some <unk> to <unk> his pain , for his old enemy is very hard with him .
He is never asleep , though sometimes he seems to fall into a dull waking <unk> .
He caused his bedstead to be moved out nearer to the window when he heard it was such <unk> weather , and his head to be so <unk> that he could see the <unk> snow and sleet .
He watches it as it falls , throughout the whole wintry day .
Upon the least noise in the house , which is kept hushed , his hand is at the pencil .
The old housekeeper , sitting by him , knows what he would write and whispers , “ No , he has not come back yet , Sir Leicester .
It was late last night when he went .
He has been but a little time gone yet . ” He withdraws his hand and falls to looking at the sleet and snow again until they seem , by being long looked at , to fall so thick and fast that he is obliged to close his eyes for a minute on the giddy <unk> of white <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
He began to look at them as soon as it was light .
The day is not yet far spent when he <unk> it to be necessary that her rooms should be prepared for her .
It is very cold and wet .
Let there be good fires .
Let them know that she is expected .
Please see to it yourself .
He writes to this purpose on his slate , and Mrs. Rouncewell with a heavy heart <unk> .
“ For I dread , George , ” the old lady says to her son , who <unk> below to keep her company when she has a little leisure , “ I dread , my dear , that my Lady will never more set foot within these walls . ” “ That ’ s a bad <unk> , mother . ” “ Nor yet within the walls of Chesney Wold , my dear . ” “ That ’ s worse .
But why , mother ? ” “ When I saw my Lady yesterday , George , she looked to me — and I may say at me too — as if the step on the Ghost ’ s Walk had almost walked her down . ” “ Come , come !
You alarm yourself with <unk> fears , mother . ” “ No I don ’ t , my dear .
No I don ’ t .
It ’ s going on for <unk> year that I have been in this family , and I never had any fears for it before .
But it ’ s breaking up , my dear ; the great old Dedlock family is breaking up . ” “ I hope not , mother . ” “ I am thankful I have lived long enough to be with Sir Leicester in this illness and trouble , for I know I am not too old nor too useless to be a <unk> sight to him than anybody else in my place would be .
But the step on the Ghost ’ s Walk will walk my Lady down , George ; it has been many a day behind her , and now it will pass her and go on . ” “ Well , mother dear , I say again , I hope not . ” “ Ah , so do I , George , ” the old lady returns , shaking her head and parting her folded hands .
“ But if my fears come true , and he has to know it , who will tell him ! ” “ Are these her rooms ? ” “ These are my Lady ’ s rooms , just as she left them . ” “ Why , now , ” says the trooper , glancing round him and speaking in a lower voice , “ I begin to understand how you come to think as you do think , mother .
<unk> get an awful look about them when they are <unk> up , like these , for one person you are used to see in them , and that person is away under any shadow , let alone being God knows where . ” He is not far out .
As all <unk> <unk> the great final one , so , empty rooms , <unk> of a familiar presence , <unk> whisper what your room and what mine must one day be .
My Lady ’ s state has a hollow look , thus gloomy and abandoned ; and in the inner apartment , where Mr. Bucket last night made his secret <unk> , the traces of her dresses and her ornaments , even the mirrors accustomed to reflect them when they were a portion of herself , have a desolate and vacant air .
<unk> and cold as the wintry day is , it is <unk> and <unk> in these deserted chambers than in many a <unk> that will <unk> <unk> the weather ; and though the servants heap fires in the <unk> and set the <unk> and the chairs within the warm glass screens that let their <unk> light <unk> through to the <unk> corners , there is a heavy cloud upon the rooms which no light will <unk> .
The old housekeeper and her son remain until the preparations are complete , and then she returns upstairs .
Volumnia has taken Mrs. Rouncewell ’ s place in the meantime , though pearl <unk> and rouge pots , however calculated to <unk> Bath , are but indifferent comforts to the <unk> under present circumstances .
Volumnia , not being supposed to know ( and indeed not knowing ) what is the matter , has found it a <unk> task to offer <unk> observations and consequently has <unk> their place with <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> on <unk> , <unk> peeping at her kinsman ’ s eyes , and one <unk> whisper to herself of , “ He is asleep . ” In <unk> of which superfluous remark Sir Leicester has indignantly written on the slate , “ I am not . ” <unk> , therefore , the chair at the bedside to the <unk> old housekeeper , Volumnia sits at a table a little removed , <unk> <unk> .
Sir Leicester watches the sleet and snow and listens for the returning steps that he <unk> .
In the ears of his old servant , looking as if she had <unk> out of an old <unk> to attend a <unk> Dedlock to another world , the silence is <unk> with <unk> of her own words , “ Who will tell him ! ” He has been under his <unk> ’ s hands this morning to be made <unk> and is as well got up as the circumstances will allow .
He is <unk> with pillows , his grey hair is brushed in its usual manner , his linen is arranged to a <unk> , and he is wrapped in a responsible <unk> .
His eye-glass and his watch are ready to his hand .
It is necessary — less to his own dignity now perhaps than for her sake — that he should be seen as little disturbed and as much himself as may be .
<unk> will talk , and Volumnia , though a Dedlock , is no <unk> case .
He keeps her here , there is little doubt , to prevent her talking somewhere else .
He is very ill , but he makes his present stand against distress of mind and body most <unk> .
The fair Volumnia , being one of those sprightly girls who cannot long continue silent without <unk> <unk> of <unk> by the dragon <unk> , soon <unk> the approach of that monster with a series of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> it impossible to <unk> those <unk> by any other process than conversation , she compliments Mrs. Rouncewell on her son , <unk> that he positively is one of the <unk> figures she ever saw and as soldierly a looking person , she should think , as what ’ s his name , her favourite <unk> <unk> — the man she <unk> on , the dearest of creatures — who was killed at <unk> .
Sir Leicester hears this tribute with so much surprise and stares about him in such a confused way that Mrs. Rouncewell feels it necessary to explain .
“ Miss Dedlock don ’ t speak of my eldest son , Sir Leicester , but my youngest .
I have found him .
He has come home . ” Sir Leicester breaks silence with a <unk> cry .
“ George ?
Your son George come home , Mrs. Rouncewell ? ” The old housekeeper <unk> her eyes .
“ Thank God .
Yes , Sir Leicester . ” Does this discovery of some one lost , this return of some one so long gone , come upon him as a strong confirmation of his hopes ?
Does he think , “ Shall I not , with the aid I have , recall her safely after this , there being <unk> hours in her case than there are years in his ? ” It is of no use <unk> him ; he is determined to speak now , and he does .
In a thick crowd of sounds , but still <unk> enough to be understood .
“ Why did you not tell me , Mrs. Rouncewell ? ” “ It happened only yesterday , Sir Leicester , and I doubted your being well enough to be talked to of such things . ” Besides , the giddy Volumnia now remembers with her little scream that nobody was to have known of his being Mrs. Rouncewell ’ s son and that she was not to have told .
But Mrs. Rouncewell <unk> , with warmth enough to swell the stomacher , that of course she would have told Sir Leicester as soon as he got better .
“ Where is your son George , Mrs. Rouncewell ? ” asks Sir Leicester , Mrs. Rouncewell , not a little alarmed by his <unk> of the doctor ’ s injunctions , replies , in London .
“ Where in London ? ” Mrs. Rouncewell is constrained to admit that he is in the house .
“ Bring him here to my room .
Bring him directly . ” The old lady can do nothing but go in search of him .
Sir Leicester , with such power of movement as he has , <unk> himself a little to receive him .
When he has done so , he looks out again at the falling sleet and snow and listens again for the returning steps .
A quantity of straw has been tumbled down in the street to <unk> the <unk> there , and she might be driven to the door perhaps without his hearing wheels .
He is lying thus , apparently <unk> of his <unk> and minor surprise , when the housekeeper returns , accompanied by her trooper son .
Mr. George <unk> softly to the bedside , makes his bow , <unk> his chest , and stands , with his face flushed , very heartily ashamed of himself .
“ Good heaven , and it is really George Rouncewell ! ” exclaims Sir Leicester .
“ Do you remember me , George ? ” The trooper <unk> to look at him and to separate this sound from that sound before he knows what he has said , but doing this and being a little helped by his mother , he replies , “ I must have a very bad memory , indeed , Sir Leicester , if I failed to remember you . ” “ When I look at you , George Rouncewell , ” Sir Leicester observes with difficulty , “ I see something of a boy at Chesney Wold — I remember well — very well . ” He looks at the trooper until tears come into his eyes , and then he looks at the sleet and snow again .
“ I ask your pardon , Sir Leicester , ” says the trooper , “ but would you accept of my arms to raise you up ?
You would lie easier , Sir Leicester , if you would allow me to move you . ” “ If you please , George Rouncewell ; if you will be so good . ” The trooper takes him in his arms like a child , lightly <unk> him , and turns him with his face more towards the window .
“ Thank you .
You have your mother ’ s gentleness , ” returns Sir Leicester , “ and your own strength .
Thank you . ” He signs to him with his hand not to go away .
George quietly remains at the bedside , waiting to be spoken to .
“ Why did you wish for secrecy ? ” It takes Sir Leicester some time to ask this .
“ Truly I am not much to boast of , Sir Leicester , and I — I should still , Sir Leicester , if you was not so <unk> — which I hope you will not be long — I should still hope for the favour of being allowed to remain unknown in general .
That <unk> <unk> not very hard to be <unk> at , not very well <unk> here , and not very <unk> to myself .
However opinions may <unk> on a variety of subjects , I should think it would be universally agreed , Sir Leicester , that I am not much to boast of . ” “ You have been a soldier , ” observes Sir Leicester , “ and a faithful one . ” George makes his military bow .
“ As far as that goes , Sir Leicester , I have done my duty under discipline , and it was the least I could do . ” “ You find me , ” says Sir Leicester , whose eyes are much attracted towards him , “ far from well , George Rouncewell . ” “ I am very sorry both to hear it and to see it , Sir Leicester . ” “ I am sure you are .
No .
In addition to my older <unk> , I have had a sudden and bad <unk> .
Something that <unk> , ” making an endeavour to pass one hand down one side , “ and <unk> , ” touching his lips .
George , with a look of assent and sympathy , makes another bow .
The different times when they were both young men ( the trooper much the younger of the two ) and looked at one another down at Chesney Wold arise before them both and soften both .
Sir Leicester , evidently with a great determination to say , in his own manner , something that is on his mind before relapsing into silence , tries to raise himself among his pillows a little more .
George , observant of the action , takes him in his arms again and places him as he <unk> to be .
“ Thank you , George .
You are another self to me .
You have often carried my spare gun at Chesney Wold , George .
You are familiar to me in these strange circumstances , very familiar . ” He has put Sir Leicester ’ s <unk> arm over his shoulder in lifting him up , and Sir Leicester is slow in drawing it away again as he says these words .
“ I was about to add , ” he presently goes on , “ I was about to add , respecting this <unk> , that it was <unk> <unk> with a slight <unk> between my Lady and myself .
I do not mean that there was any difference between us ( for there has been none ) , but that there was a <unk> of certain circumstances important only to ourselves , which <unk> me , for a little while , of my Lady ’ s society .
She has found it necessary to make a journey — I trust will shortly return .
Volumnia , do I make myself <unk> ?
The words are not quite under my command in the manner of <unk> them . ” Volumnia <unk> him perfectly , and in truth he delivers himself with far greater <unk> than could have been supposed possible a minute ago .
The effort by which he does so is written in the anxious and labouring expression of his face .
Nothing but the strength of his purpose <unk> him to make it .
“ Therefore , Volumnia , I desire to say in your presence — and in the presence of my old <unk> and friend , Mrs. Rouncewell , whose truth and fidelity no one can question , and in the presence of her son George , who comes back like a familiar recollection of my youth in the home of my <unk> at Chesney Wold — in case I should <unk> , in case I should not recover , in case I should lose both my speech and the power of writing , though I hope for better things — ” The old housekeeper weeping silently ; Volumnia in the greatest agitation , with the <unk> bloom on her cheeks ; the trooper with his arms folded and his head a little bent , respectfully attentive .
“ Therefore I desire to say , and to call you all to witness — beginning , Volumnia , with yourself , most solemnly — that I am on <unk> terms with Lady Dedlock .
That I <unk> no cause whatever of complaint against her .
That I have ever had the strongest affection for her , and that I retain it <unk> .
Say this to herself , and to every one .
If you ever say less than this , you will be guilty of <unk> <unk> to me . ” Volumnia <unk> <unk> that she will observe his injunctions to the letter .
“ My Lady is too high in position , too handsome , too accomplished , too superior in most respects to the best of those by whom she is surrounded , not to have her enemies and <unk> , I dare say .
Let it be known to them , as I make it known to you , that being of sound mind , memory , and understanding , I <unk> no disposition I have made in her favour .
I <unk> nothing I have ever bestowed upon her .
I am on <unk> terms with her , and I recall — having the full power to do it if I were so disposed , as you see — no act I have done for her advantage and happiness . ” His formal array of words might have at any other time , as it has often had , something <unk> in it , but at this time it is serious and affecting .
His noble earnestness , his fidelity , his <unk> <unk> of her , his generous <unk> of his own wrong and his own pride for her sake , are simply honourable , <unk> , and true .
Nothing less worthy can be seen through the <unk> of such qualities in the <unk> <unk> , nothing less worthy can be seen in the <unk> gentleman .
In such a light both <unk> alike , both rise alike , both children of the dust shine equally .
<unk> by his <unk> , he lays his head back on his pillows and closes his eyes for not more than a minute , when he again resumes his watching of the weather and his attention to the muffled sounds .
In the rendering of those little services , and in the manner of their acceptance , the trooper has become <unk> as necessary to him .
Nothing has been said , but it is quite understood .
He falls a step or two backward to be out of sight and <unk> guard a little behind his mother ’ s chair .
The day is now beginning to decline .
The mist and the sleet into which the snow has all resolved itself are <unk> , and the blaze begins to tell more <unk> upon the room walls and furniture .
The gloom <unk> ; the bright gas <unk> up in the streets ; and the <unk> oil lamps which yet hold their ground there , with their source of life half frozen and half <unk> , <unk> <unk> like fiery fish out of water — as they are .
The world , which has been <unk> over the straw and pulling at the bell , “ to inquire , ” begins to go home , begins to dress , to dine , to <unk> its dear friend with all the last new <unk> , as already mentioned .
Now does Sir Leicester become worse , restless , uneasy , and in great pain .
Volumnia , lighting a candle ( with a <unk> <unk> for doing something <unk> ) , is bidden to put it out again , for it is not yet dark enough .
Yet it is very dark too , as dark as it will be all night .
By and by she tries again .
No !
Put it out .
It is not dark enough yet .
His old housekeeper is the first to understand that he is striving to <unk> the fiction with himself that it is not growing late .
“ Dear Sir Leicester , my honoured master , ” she softly whispers , “ I must , for your own good , and my duty , take the <unk> of begging and <unk> that you will not lie here in the <unk> darkness watching and waiting and dragging through the time .
Let me draw the curtains , and light the candles , and make things more comfortable about you .
The <unk> will strike the hours just the same , Sir Leicester , and the night will pass away just the same .
My Lady will come back , just the same . ” “ I know it , Mrs. Rouncewell , but I am weak — and she has been so long gone . ” “ Not so very long , Sir Leicester .
Not <unk> hours yet . ” “ But that is a long time .
Oh , it is a long time ! ” He says it with a groan that <unk> her heart .
She knows that this is not a period for bringing the rough light upon him ; she thinks his tears too sacred to be seen , even by her .
Therefore she sits in the darkness for a while without a word , then gently begins to move about , now stirring the fire , now standing at the dark window looking out .
<unk> he tells her , with recovered <unk> , “ As you say , Mrs. Rouncewell , it is no worse for being confessed .
It is getting late , and they are not come .
<unk> the room ! ” When it is lighted and the weather shut out , it is only left to him to listen .
But they find that however dejected and ill he is , he <unk> when a quiet pretence is made of looking at the fires in her rooms and being sure that everything is ready to receive her .
Poor pretence as it is , these <unk> to her being expected keep up hope within him .
<unk> comes , and with it the same blank .
The carriages in the streets are few , and other late sounds in that neighbourhood there are none , unless a man so very <unk> drunk as to stray into the <unk> <unk> goes <unk> and <unk> along the pavement .
Upon this wintry night it is so still that listening to the intense silence is like looking at intense darkness .
If any distant sound be audible in this case , it departs through the gloom like a feeble light in that , and all is <unk> than before .
The <unk> of servants are dismissed to bed ( not unwilling to go , for they were up all last night ) , and only Mrs. Rouncewell and George keep watch in Sir Leicester ’ s room .
As the night <unk> <unk> on — or rather when it seems to stop altogether , at between two and three o ’ clock — they find a restless <unk> on him to know more about the weather , now he cannot see it .
Hence George , <unk> regularly every half-hour to the rooms so carefully looked after , <unk> his march to the <unk> , looks about him , and brings back the best report he can make of the worst of nights , the sleet still falling and even the stone <unk> lying <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Volumnia , in her room up a retired landing on the staircase — the second turning past the end of the <unk> and <unk> , a cousinly room containing a fearful <unk> of a portrait of Sir Leicester <unk> for its <unk> , and commanding in the day a solemn yard planted with <unk> <unk> like <unk> specimens of black tea — is a prey to horrors of many kinds .
Not last nor least among them , possibly , is a horror of what may <unk> her little income in the event , as she expresses it , “ of anything <unk> ” to Sir Leicester .
Anything , in this sense , meaning one thing only ; and that the last thing that can happen to the consciousness of any baronet in the known world .
An effect of these horrors is that Volumnia finds she cannot go to bed in her own room or sit by the fire in her own room , but must come forth with her fair head tied up in a <unk> of shawl , and her fair form <unk> in <unk> , and <unk> the mansion like a ghost , particularly <unk> the rooms , warm and <unk> , prepared for one who still does not return .
<unk> under such circumstances being not to be thought of , Volumnia is attended by her maid , who , impressed from her own bed for that purpose , extremely cold , very <unk> , and generally an injured maid as <unk> by circumstances to take office with a cousin , when she had resolved to be maid to nothing less than ten thousand a year , has not a sweet expression of countenance .
The <unk> visits of the trooper to these rooms , however , in the course of his <unk> is an assurance of protection and company both to mistress and maid , which <unk> them very <unk> in the small hours of the night .
Whenever he is heard advancing , they both make some little <unk> preparation to receive him ; at other times they <unk> their watches into short scraps of oblivion and <unk> not wholly free from <unk> , as to whether Miss Dedlock , sitting with her feet upon the <unk> , was or was not falling into the fire when <unk> ( to her great displeasure ) by her guardian <unk> the maid .
“ How is Sir Leicester now , Mr. George ? ” inquires Volumnia , adjusting her <unk> over her head .
“ Why , Sir Leicester is much the same , miss .
He is very low and ill , and he even <unk> a little sometimes . ” “ Has he asked for me ? ” inquires Volumnia tenderly .
“ Why , no , I can ’ t say he has , miss .
Not within my hearing , that is to say . ” “ This is a truly sad time , Mr. George . ” “ It is indeed , miss .
Hadn ’ t you better go to bed ? ” “ You had a deal better go to bed , Miss Dedlock , ” quoth the maid sharply .
But Volumnia answers No !
No !
She may be asked for , she may be wanted at a moment ’ s notice .
She never should forgive herself “ if anything was to happen ” and she was not on the spot .
She <unk> to enter on the question , <unk> by the maid , how the spot comes to be there , and not in her room ( which is nearer to Sir Leicester ’ s ) , but <unk> declares that on the spot she will remain .
Volumnia further makes a merit of not having “ closed an eye ” — as if she had twenty or thirty — though it is hard to <unk> this <unk> with her having most <unk> opened two within five minutes .
But when it comes to four o ’ clock , and still the same blank , Volumnia ’ s constancy begins to fail her , or rather it begins to <unk> , for she now considers that it is her duty to be ready for the morrow , when much may be expected of her , that , in fact , <unk> anxious to remain upon the spot , it may be required of her , as an act of <unk> , to desert the spot .
So when the trooper <unk> with his , “ Hadn ’ t you better go to bed , miss ? ” and when the maid <unk> , more sharply than before , “ You had a deal better go to bed , Miss Dedlock ! ” she <unk> rises and says , “ Do with me what you think best ! ” Mr. George undoubtedly thinks it best to escort her on his arm to the door of her cousinly chamber , and the maid as undoubtedly thinks it best to <unk> her into bed with mighty little ceremony .
<unk> , these steps are taken ; and now the trooper , in his <unk> , has the house to himself .
There is no <unk> in the weather .
From the <unk> , from the <unk> , from the parapet , from every <unk> and post and pillar , <unk> the <unk> snow .
It has crept , as if for shelter , into the <unk> of the great door — under it , into the corners of the windows , into every <unk> and <unk> of retreat , and there <unk> and dies .
It is falling still ; upon the roof , upon the skylight , even through the skylight , and drip , drip , drip , with the <unk> of the Ghost ’ s Walk , on the stone floor below .
The trooper , his old <unk> awakened by the solitary grandeur of a great house — no novelty to him once at Chesney Wold — goes up the stairs and through the chief rooms , holding up his light at arm ’ s length .
<unk> of his <unk> fortunes within the last few weeks , and of his rustic <unk> , and of the two periods of his life so strangely brought together across the wide <unk> space ; thinking of the murdered man whose image is fresh in his mind ; thinking of the lady who has disappeared from these very rooms and the tokens of whose <unk> presence are all here ; thinking of the master of the house upstairs and of the <unk> , “ Who will tell him ! ” he looks here and looks there , and <unk> how he <unk> see something now , which it would tax his <unk> to walk up to , lay his hand upon , and prove to be a fancy .
But it is all blank , blank as the darkness above and below , while he goes up the great staircase again , blank as the <unk> silence .
“ All is still in <unk> , George Rouncewell ? ” “ Quite orderly and right , Sir Leicester . ” “ No word of any kind ? ” The trooper shakes his head .
“ No letter that can possibly have been <unk> ? ” But he knows there is no such hope as that and lays his head down without looking for an answer .
Very familiar to him , as he said himself some hours ago , George Rouncewell lifts him into easier <unk> through the long remainder of the blank wintry night , and equally familiar with his <unk> wish , <unk> the light and <unk> the curtains at the first late break of day .
The day comes like a <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , and vague , it sends a warning <unk> before it of a <unk> <unk> , as if it cried out , “ Look what I am bringing you who watch there !
Who will tell him ! ” CHAPTER <unk> Esther ’ s Narrative It was three o ’ clock in the morning when the houses outside London did at last begin to <unk> the country and to close us in with streets .
We had made our way along roads in a far worse condition than when we had <unk> them by daylight , both the fall and the <unk> having lasted ever since ; but the energy of my companion never <unk> .
It had only been , as I thought , of less assistance than the horses in getting us on , and it had often <unk> them .
They had stopped exhausted <unk> up hills , they had been driven through streams of <unk> water , they had slipped down and become <unk> with the <unk> ; but he and his little lantern had been always ready , and when the <unk> was set right , I had never heard any <unk> in his cool , “ Get on , my <unk> ! ” The <unk> and confidence with which he had directed our journey back I could not account for .
Never <unk> , he never even stopped to make an inquiry until we were within a few miles of London .
A very few words , here and there , were then enough for him ; and thus we came , at between three and four o ’ clock in the morning , into <unk> .
I will not <unk> on the suspense and anxiety with which I reflected all this time that we were leaving my mother farther and farther behind every minute .
I think I had some strong hope that he must be right and could not fail to have a satisfactory object in following this woman , but I <unk> myself with <unk> it and <unk> it during the whole journey .
What was to <unk> when we found her and what could <unk> us for this loss of time were questions also that I could not possibly dismiss ; my mind was quite <unk> by long dwelling on such <unk> when we stopped .
We stopped in a <unk> where there was a <unk> .
My companion paid our two <unk> , who were as completely covered with <unk> as if they had been dragged along the roads like the carriage itself , and giving them some brief direction where to take it , lifted me out of it and into a <unk> he had chosen from the rest .
“ Why , my dear ! ” he said as he did this .
“ How wet you are ! ” I had not been conscious of it .
But the melted snow had found its way into the carriage , and I had got out two or three times when a fallen horse was plunging and had to be got up , and the wet had <unk> my dress .
I assured him it was no matter , but the driver , who knew him , would not be <unk> by me from running down the street to his stable , whence he brought an <unk> of clean dry straw .
They shook it out and <unk> it well about me , and I found it warm and comfortable .
“ Now , my dear , ” said Mr. Bucket , with his head in at the window after I was shut up .
“ We ’ re a-going to mark this person down .
It may take a little time , but you don ’ t mind that .
You ’ re pretty sure that I ’ ve got a <unk> .
Ain ’ t you ? ” I little thought what it was , little thought in how short a time I should understand it better , but I assured him that I had confidence in him .
“ So you may have , my dear , ” he returned .
“ And I tell you what !
If you only repose half as much confidence in me as I repose in you after what I ’ ve experienced of you , that ’ ll do .
Lord !
You ’ re no trouble at all .
I never see a young woman in any station of society — and I ’ ve seen many elevated ones too — conduct herself like you have conducted yourself since you was called out of your bed .
You ’ re a pattern , you know , that ’ s what you are , ” said Mr. Bucket <unk> ; “ you ’ re a pattern . ” I told him I was very glad , as indeed I was , to have been no <unk> to him , and that I hoped I should be none now .
“ My dear , ” he returned , “ when a young lady is as mild as she ’ s game , and as game as she ’ s mild , that ’ s all I ask , and more than I expect .
She then becomes a queen , and that ’ s about what you are yourself . ” With these encouraging words — they really were encouraging to me under those lonely and anxious circumstances — he got upon the box , and we once more drove away .
Where we drove I neither knew then nor have ever known since , but we appeared to seek out the <unk> and worst streets in London .
Whenever I saw him directing the driver , I was prepared for our <unk> into a deeper <unk> of such streets , and we never failed to do so .
Sometimes we <unk> upon a <unk> thoroughfare or came to a larger building than the <unk> , well lighted .
Then we stopped at offices like those we had visited when we began our journey , and I saw him in <unk> with others .
Sometimes he would get down by an archway or at a street corner and mysteriously show the light of his little lantern .
This would <unk> similar lights from various dark quarters , like so many <unk> , and a fresh <unk> would be held .
By degrees we appeared to <unk> our search within <unk> and easier limits .
<unk> <unk> on duty could now tell Mr. Bucket what he wanted to know and point to him where to go .
At last we stopped for a rather long conversation between him and one of these men , which I supposed to be satisfactory from his manner of nodding from time to time .
When it was finished he came to me looking very busy and very attentive .
“ Now , Miss Summerson , ” he said to me , “ you won ’ t be alarmed whatever comes off , I know .
It ’ s not necessary for me to give you any further caution than to tell you that we have marked this person down and that you may be of use to me before I know it myself .
I don ’ t like to ask such a thing , my dear , but would you walk a little way ? ” Of course I got out directly and took his arm .
“ It ain ’ t so easy to keep your feet , ” said Mr. Bucket , “ but take time . ” Although I looked about me <unk> and hurriedly as we crossed the street , I thought I knew the place .
“ Are we in Holborn ? ” I asked him .
“ Yes , ” said Mr. Bucket .
“ Do you know this turning ? ” “ It looks like Chancery Lane . ” “ And was christened so , my dear , ” said Mr. Bucket .
We turned down it , and as we went shuffling through the sleet , I heard the clocks strike half-past five .
We passed on in silence and as quickly as we could with such a <unk> , when some one coming towards us on the narrow pavement , wrapped in a cloak , stopped and stood aside to give me room .
In the same moment I heard an exclamation of wonder and my own name from Mr. Woodcourt .
I knew his voice very well .
It was so unexpected and so — I don ’ t know what to call it , whether pleasant or painful — to come upon it after my <unk> wandering journey , and in the midst of the night , that I could not keep back the tears from my eyes .
It was like hearing his voice in a strange country .
“ My dear Miss Summerson , that you should be out at this hour , and in such weather ! ” He had heard from my guardian of my having been called away on some uncommon business and said so to dispense with any explanation .
I told him that we had but just left a coach and were going — but then I was obliged to look at my companion .
“ Why , you see , Mr. Woodcourt ” — he had caught the name from me — “ we are a-going at present into the next street .
Inspector Bucket . ” Mr. Woodcourt , <unk> my <unk> , had hurriedly taken off his cloak and was putting it about me .
“ That ’ s a good move , too , ” said Mr. Bucket , assisting , “ a very good move . ” “ May I go with you ? ” said Mr. Woodcourt .
I don ’ t know whether to me or to my companion .
“ Why , Lord ! ” exclaimed Mr. Bucket , taking the answer on himself .
“ Of course you may . ” It was all said in a moment , and they took me between them , wrapped in the cloak .
“ I have just left Richard , ” said Mr. Woodcourt .
“ I have been sitting with him since ten o ’ clock last night . ” “ Oh , dear me , he is ill ! ” “ No , no , believe me ; not ill , but not quite well .
He was depressed and faint — you know he gets so <unk> and so worn sometimes — and Ada sent to me of course ; and when I came home I found her note and came straight here .
Well !
Richard revived so much after a little while , and Ada was so happy and so convinced of its being my doing , though God knows I had little enough to do with it , that I remained with him until he had been fast asleep some hours .
As fast asleep as she is now , I hope ! ” His friendly and familiar way of speaking of them , his <unk> devotion to them , the grateful confidence with which I knew he had inspired my darling , and the comfort he was to her ; could I separate all this from his promise to me ?
How <unk> I must have been if it had not recalled the words he said to me when he was so moved by the change in my appearance : “ I will accept him as a trust , and it shall be a sacred one ! ” We now turned into another narrow street .
“ Mr.
Woodcourt , ” said Mr. Bucket , who had eyed him closely as we came along , “ our business takes us to a law-stationer ’ s here , a certain Mr. Snagsby ’ s .
What , you know him , do you ? ” He was so quick that he saw it in an instant .
“ Yes , I know a little of him and have called upon him at this place . ” “ Indeed , sir ? ” said Mr. Bucket .
“ Then you will be so good as to let me leave Miss Summerson with you for a moment while I go and have half a word with him ? ” The last <unk> with whom he had <unk> was standing silently behind us .
I was not aware of it until he struck in on my saying I heard some one crying .
“ Don ’ t be alarmed , miss , ” he returned .
“ It ’ s Snagsby ’ s servant . ” “ Why , you see , ” said Mr. Bucket , “ the girl ’ s subject to fits , and has ’ em bad upon her to-night .
A most contrary circumstance it is , for I want certain information out of that girl , and she must be brought to reason somehow . ” “ At all events , they wouldn ’ t be up yet if it wasn ’ t for her , Mr. Bucket , ” said the other man .
“ She ’ s been at it pretty well all night , sir . ” “ Well , that ’ s true , ” he returned .
“ My light ’ s burnt out .
<unk> yours a moment . ” All this passed in a whisper a door or two from the house in which I could faintly hear crying and <unk> .
In the little round of light produced for the purpose , Mr. Bucket went up to the door and knocked .
The door was opened after he had knocked twice , and he went in , leaving us standing in the street .
“ Miss Summerson , ” said Mr. Woodcourt , “ if without <unk> myself on your confidence I may remain near you , pray let me do so . ” “ You are truly kind , ” I answered .
“ I need wish to keep no secret of my own from you ; if I keep any , it is another ’ s . ” “ I quite understand .
Trust me , I will remain near you only so long as I can fully respect it . ” “ I trust <unk> to you , ” I said .
“ I know and deeply feel how <unk> you keep your promise . ” After a short time the little round of light shone out again , and Mr. Bucket advanced towards us in it with his earnest face .
“ Please to come in , Miss Summerson , ” he said , “ and sit down by the fire .
Mr. Woodcourt , from information I have received I understand you are a medical man .
Would you look to this girl and see if anything can be done to bring her round .
She has a letter somewhere that I particularly want .
It ’ s not in her box , and I think it must be about her ; but she is so twisted and <unk> up that she is difficult to handle without hurting . ” We all three went into the house together ; although it was cold and raw , it <unk> close too from being up all night .
In the passage behind the door stood a <unk> , <unk> little man in a grey coat who seemed to have a naturally polite manner and spoke <unk> .
“ <unk> , if you please , Mr. Bucket , ” said he .
“ The lady will excuse the front kitchen ; we use it as our <unk> sitting-room .
The back is Guster ’ s bedroom , and in it she ’ s <unk> on , poor thing , to a <unk> extent ! ” We went downstairs , followed by Mr. Snagsby , as I soon found the little man to be .
In the front kitchen , sitting by the fire , was Mrs. Snagsby , with very red eyes and a very severe expression of face .
“ My little woman , ” said Mr. Snagsby , entering behind us , “ to wave — not to put too fine a point upon it , my dear — <unk> for one single moment in the course of this <unk> night , here is Inspector Bucket , Mr. Woodcourt , and a lady . ” She looked very much astonished , as she had reason for doing , and looked particularly hard at me .
“ My little woman , ” said Mr. Snagsby , sitting down in the remotest corner by the door , as if he were taking a liberty , “ it is not unlikely that you may inquire of me why Inspector Bucket , Mr. Woodcourt , and a lady call upon us in Cook ’ s Court , Cursitor Street , at the present hour .
I don ’ t know .
I have not the least idea .
If I was to be informed , I should despair of understanding , and I ’ d rather not be told . ” He appeared so miserable , sitting with his head upon his hand , and I appeared so <unk> , that I was going to offer an apology when Mr. Bucket took the matter on himself .
“ Now , Mr. Snagsby , ” said he , “ the best thing you can do is to go along with Mr. Woodcourt to look after your Guster — ” “ My Guster , Mr. Bucket ! ” cried Mr. Snagsby .
“ Go on , sir , go on .
I shall be charged with that next . ” “ And to hold the candle , ” pursued Mr. Bucket without correcting himself , “ or hold her , or make yourself useful in any way you ’ re asked .
Which there ’ s not a man alive more ready to do , for you ’ re a man of <unk> and <unk> , you know , and you ’ ve got the sort of heart that can feel for another .
Mr. Woodcourt , would you be so good as see to her , and if you can get that letter from her , to let me have it as soon as ever you can ? ” As they went out , Mr. Bucket made me sit down in a corner by the fire and take off my wet shoes , which he turned up to dry upon the <unk> , talking all the time .
“ Don ’ t you be at all put out , miss , by the want of a hospitable look from Mrs. Snagsby there , because she ’ s under a mistake altogether .
She ’ ll find that out sooner than will be agreeable to a lady of her generally correct manner of <unk> her thoughts , because I ’ m a-going to explain it to her . ” Here , standing on the hearth with his wet hat and <unk> in his hand , himself a pile of wet , he turned to Mrs. Snagsby .
“ Now , the first thing that I say to you , as a married woman possessing what you may call charms , you know — ‘ <unk> Me , if All Those <unk> , ’ and <unk> — you ’ re well acquainted with the song , because it ’ s in vain for you to tell me that you and good society are <unk> — charms — attractions , mind you , that ought to give you confidence in yourself — is , that you ’ ve done it . ” Mrs. Snagsby looked rather alarmed , <unk> a little and <unk> , what did Mr. Bucket mean .
“ What does Mr. Bucket mean ? ” he repeated , and I saw by his face that all the time he talked he was listening for the discovery of the letter , to my own great agitation , for I knew then how important it must be ; “ I ’ ll tell you what he means , ma ’ am .
Go and see <unk> <unk> .
That ’ s the <unk> for you . ” Mrs. Snagsby <unk> asked why .
“ Why ? ” said Mr. Bucket .
“ Because you ’ ll come to that if you don ’ t look out .
Why , at the very moment while I speak , I know what your mind ’ s not wholly free from respecting this young lady .
But shall I tell you who this young lady is ?
Now , come , you ’ re what I call an intellectual woman — with your soul too large for your body , if you come to that , and <unk> it — and you know me , and you recollect where you saw me last , and what was talked of in that circle .
Don ’ t you ?
Yes !
Very well .
This young lady is that young lady . ” Mrs. Snagsby appeared to understand the reference better than I did at the time .
“ And Toughey — him as you call Jo — was mixed up in the same business , and no other ; and the law-writer that you know of was mixed up in the same business , and no other ; and your husband , with no more knowledge of it than your great grandfather , was mixed up ( by Mr. Tulkinghorn , deceased , his best customer ) in the same business , and no other ; and the whole <unk> of people was mixed up in the same business , and no other .
And yet a married woman , possessing your attractions , shuts her eyes ( and <unk> too ) , and goes and runs her <unk> head against a wall .
Why , I am ashamed of you !
( I expected Mr. Woodcourt might have got it by this time .
) ” Mrs. Snagsby shook her head and put her handkerchief to her eyes .
“ Is that all ? ” said Mr. Bucket <unk> .
“ No .
See what happens .
Another person mixed up in that business and no other , a person in a wretched state , comes here to-night and is seen <unk> to your <unk> ; and between her and your <unk> there passes a paper that I would give a hundred pound for , down .
What do you do ?
You hide and you watch ’ em , and you <unk> upon that <unk> — knowing what she ’ s subject to and what a little thing will bring ’ em on — in that surprising manner and with that severity that , by the Lord , she goes off and keeps off , when a life may be hanging upon that girl ’ s words ! ” He so thoroughly meant what he said now that I <unk> clasped my hands and felt the room turning away from me .
But it stopped .
Mr. Woodcourt came in , put a paper into his hand , and went away again .
“ Now , Mrs. Snagsby , the only <unk> you can make , ” said Mr. Bucket , rapidly glancing at it , “ is to let me speak a word to this young lady in private here .
And if you know of any help that you can give to that gentleman in the next kitchen there or can think of any one thing that ’ s <unk> than another to bring the girl round , do your <unk> and best ! ” In an instant she was gone , and he had shut the door .
“ Now my dear , you ’ re steady and quite sure of yourself ? ” “ Quite , ” said I.
“ <unk> writing is that ? ” It was my mother ’ s .
A <unk> , on a crushed and torn piece of paper , blotted with wet .
<unk> <unk> like a letter , and directed to me at my guardian ’ s .
“ You know the hand , ” he said , “ and if you are firm enough to read it to me , do !
But be particular to a word . ” It had been written in <unk> , at different times .
I read what follows : I came to the cottage with two objects .
First , to see the dear one , if I could , once more — but only to see her — not to speak to her or let her know that I was near .
The other object , to <unk> pursuit and to be lost .
Do not blame the mother for her share .
The assistance that she rendered me , she rendered on my strongest assurance that it was for the dear one ’ s good .
You remember her dead child .
The men ’ s consent I bought , but her help was freely given .
“ ‘ I came . ’ That was written , ” said my companion , “ when she rested there .
It bears out what I made of it .
I was right . ” The next was written at another time : I have wandered a long distance , and for many hours , and I know that I must soon die .
These streets !
I have no purpose but to die .
When I left , I had a worse , but I am saved from adding that <unk> to the rest .
<unk> , wet , and fatigue are sufficient causes for my being found dead , but I shall die of others , though I suffer from these .
It was right that all that had <unk> me should give way at once and that I should die of terror and my conscience .
“ Take courage , ” said Mr. Bucket .
“ There ’ s only a few words more . ” Those , too , were written at another time .
To all appearance , almost in the dark : I have done all I could do to be lost .
I shall be soon forgotten so , and shall disgrace him least .
I have nothing about me by which I can be recognized .
This paper I part with now .
The place where I shall lie down , if I can get so far , has been often in my mind .
<unk> .
<unk> .
Mr. Bucket , <unk> me with his arm , <unk> me gently into my chair .
“ <unk> up !
Don ’ t think me hard with you , my dear , but as soon as ever you feel equal to it , get your shoes on and be ready . ” I did as he required , but I was left there a long time , <unk> for my unhappy mother .
They were all occupied with the poor girl , and I heard Mr. Woodcourt directing them and speaking to her often .
At length he came in with Mr. Bucket and said that as it was important to address her gently , he thought it best that I should ask her for whatever information we desired to obtain .
There was no doubt that she could now reply to questions if she were <unk> and not alarmed .
The questions , Mr. Bucket said , were how she came by the letter , what passed between her and the person who gave her the letter , and where the person went .
<unk> my mind as steadily as I could to these points , I went into the next room with them .
Mr. Woodcourt would have remained outside , but at my <unk> went in with us .
The poor girl was sitting on the floor where they had laid her down .
They stood around her , though at a little distance , that she might have air .
She was not pretty and looked weak and poor , but she had a plaintive and a good face , though it was still a little wild .
I <unk> on the ground beside her and put her poor head upon my shoulder , <unk> she drew her arm round my neck and burst into tears .
“ My poor girl , ” said I , laying my face against her forehead , for indeed I was crying too , and trembling , “ it seems cruel to trouble you now , but more <unk> on our knowing something about this letter than I could tell you in an hour . ” She began <unk> <unk> that she didn ’ t mean any harm , she didn ’ t mean any harm , Mrs. Snagsby !
“ We are all sure of that , ” said I.
“ But pray tell me how you got it . ” “ Yes , dear lady , I will , and tell you true .
I ’ ll tell true , indeed , Mrs. Snagsby . ” “ I am sure of that , ” said I.
“ And how was it ? ” “ I had been out on an errand , dear lady — long after it was dark — quite late ; and when I came home , I found a <unk> person , all wet and muddy , looking up at our house .
When she saw me coming in at the door , she called me back and said did I live here .
And I said yes , and she said she knew only one or two places about here , but had lost her way and couldn ’ t find them .
Oh , what shall I do , what shall I do !
They won ’ t believe me !
She didn ’ t say any harm to me , and I didn ’ t say any harm to her , indeed , Mrs. Snagsby ! ” It was necessary for her mistress to comfort her — which she did , I must say , with a good deal of <unk> — before she could be got beyond this .
“ She could not find those places , ” said I.
“ No ! ” cried the girl , shaking her head .
“ No !
<unk> ’ t find them .
And she was so faint , and lame , and miserable , Oh so wretched , that if you had seen her , Mr. Snagsby , you ’ d have given her half a crown , I know ! ” “ Well , Guster , my girl , ” said he , at first not knowing what to say .
“ I hope I should . ” “ And yet she was so well spoken , ” said the girl , looking at me with wide open eyes , “ that it made a person ’ s heart <unk> .
And so she said to me , did I know the way to the burying ground ?
And I asked her which burying ground .
And she said , the poor burying ground .
And so I told her I had been a poor child myself , and it was according to <unk> .
But she said she meant a poor burying ground not very far from here , where there was an archway , and a step , and an iron gate . ” As I watched her face and <unk> her to go on , I saw that Mr. Bucket received this with a look which I could not separate from one of alarm .
“ Oh , dear , dear ! ” cried the girl , pressing her hair back with her hands .
“ What shall I do , what shall I do !
She meant the burying ground where the man was buried that took the <unk> — that you came home and told us of , Mr. Snagsby — that frightened me so , Mrs. Snagsby .
Oh , I am frightened again .
Hold me ! ” “ You are so much better now , ” <unk> I.
“ Pray , pray tell me more . ” “ Yes I will , yes I will !
But don ’ t be angry with me , that ’ s a dear lady , because I have been so ill . ” <unk> with her , poor soul !
“ There !
Now I will , now I will .
So she said , could I tell her how to find it , and I said yes , and I told her ; and she looked at me with eyes like almost as if she was blind , and herself all waving back .
And so she took out the letter , and showed it me , and said if she was to put that in the post-office , it would be rubbed out and not <unk> and never sent ; and would I take it from her , and send it , and the messenger would be paid at the house .
And so I said yes , if it was no harm , and she said no — no harm .
And so I took it from her , and she said she had nothing to give me , and I said I was poor myself and consequently wanted nothing .
And so she said God bless you , and went . ” “ And did she go — ” “ Yes , ” cried the girl , anticipating the inquiry .
“ Yes !
She went the way I had shown her .
Then I came in , and Mrs. Snagsby came behind me from somewhere and laid hold of me , and I was frightened . ” Mr. Woodcourt took her kindly from me .
Mr. Bucket wrapped me up , and immediately we were in the street .
Mr. Woodcourt <unk> , but I said , “ Don ’ t leave me now ! ” and Mr. Bucket added , “ You ’ ll be better with us , we may want you ; don ’ t lose time ! ” I have the most confused impressions of that walk .
I recollect that it was neither night nor day , that morning was <unk> but the <unk> were not yet put out , that the sleet was still falling and that all the ways were deep with it .
I recollect a few chilled people passing in the streets .
I recollect the wet <unk> , the <unk> and bursting <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> of blackened <unk> and snow over which we passed , the <unk> of the courts by which we went .
At the same time I remember that the poor girl seemed to be yet telling her story <unk> and plainly in my hearing , that I could feel her resting on my arm , that the stained <unk> put on human shapes and looked at me , that great <unk> seemed to be opening and closing in my head or in the air , and that the <unk> things were more <unk> than the real .
At last we stood under a dark and miserable covered way , where one lamp was burning over an iron gate and where the morning faintly <unk> in .
The gate was closed .
<unk> it was a <unk> ground — a dreadful spot in which the night was very slowly stirring , but where I could dimly see heaps of <unk> graves and stones , <unk> in by <unk> houses with a few dull lights in their windows and on whose walls a thick <unk> broke out like a <unk> .
On the step at the gate , <unk> in the fearful wet of such a place , which <unk> and <unk> down everywhere , I saw , with a cry of pity and horror , a woman lying — Jenny , the mother of the dead child .
I ran forward , but they stopped me , and Mr. Woodcourt entreated me with the greatest earnestness , even with tears , before I went up to the figure to listen for an instant to what Mr. Bucket said .
I did so , as I thought .
I did so , as I am sure .
“ Miss Summerson , you ’ ll understand me , if you think a moment .
They changed clothes at the cottage . ” They changed clothes at the cottage .
I could repeat the words in my mind , and I knew what they meant of themselves , but I attached no meaning to them in any other connexion .
“ And one returned , ” said Mr. Bucket , “ and one went on .
And the one that went on only went on a certain way agreed upon to deceive and then turned across country and went home .
Think a moment ! ” I could repeat this in my mind too , but I had not the least idea what it meant .
I saw before me , lying on the step , the mother of the dead child .
She lay there with one arm creeping round a bar of the iron gate and seeming to embrace it .
She lay there , who had so lately spoken to my mother .
She lay there , a distressed , <unk> , <unk> creature .
She who had brought my mother ’ s letter , who could give me the only clue to where my mother was ; she , who was to guide us to <unk> and save her whom we had sought so far , who had come to this condition by some means connected with my mother that I could not follow , and might be passing beyond our reach and help at that moment ; she lay there , and they stopped me !
I saw but did not comprehend the solemn and compassionate look in Mr. Woodcourt ’ s face .
I saw but did not comprehend his touching the other on the breast to keep him back .
I saw him stand <unk> in the bitter air , with a <unk> for something .
But my understanding for all this was gone .
I even heard it said between them , “ Shall she go ? ” “ She had better go .
Her hands should be the first to touch her .
They have a higher right than ours . ” I passed on to the gate and stooped down .
I lifted the heavy head , put the long <unk> hair aside , and turned the face .
And it was my mother , cold and dead .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> I proceed to other passages of my narrative .
From the goodness of all about me I derived such consolation as I can never think of unmoved .
I have already said so much of myself , and so much still remains , that I will not <unk> upon my sorrow .
I had an illness , but it was not a long one ; and I would avoid even this mention of it if I could quite keep down the recollection of their sympathy .
I proceed to other passages of my narrative .
During the time of my illness , we were still in London , where Mrs. Woodcourt had come , on my guardian ’ s <unk> , to stay with us .
When my guardian thought me well and cheerful enough to talk with him in our old way — though I could have done that sooner if he would have believed me — I resumed my work and my chair beside his .
He had appointed the time himself , and we were alone .
“ Dame Trot , ” said he , receiving me with a kiss , “ welcome to the growlery again , my dear .
I have a scheme to <unk> , little woman .
I propose to remain here , perhaps for six months , perhaps for a longer time — as it may be .
Quite to settle here for a while , in short . ” “ And in the meanwhile leave Bleak House ? ” said I.
“ Aye , my dear ?
Bleak House , ” he returned , “ must learn to take care of itself . ” I thought his tone sounded sorrowful , but looking at him , I saw his kind face lighted up by its pleasantest smile .
“ Bleak House , ” he repeated — and his tone did NOT sound sorrowful , I found — “ must learn to take care of itself .
It is a long way from Ada , my dear , and Ada stands much in need of you . ” “ It ’ s like you , guardian , ” said I , “ to have been taking that into consideration for a happy surprise to both of us . ” “ Not so disinterested either , my dear , if you mean to <unk> me for that virtue , since if you were generally on the road , you could be seldom with me .
And besides , I wish to hear as much and as often of Ada as I can in this condition of <unk> from poor Rick .
Not of her alone , but of him too , poor fellow . ” “ Have you seen Mr. Woodcourt , this morning , guardian ? ” “ I see Mr. Woodcourt every morning , Dame Durden . ” “ Does he still say the same of Richard ? ” “ Just the same .
He knows of no direct bodily illness that he has ; on the contrary , he believes that he has none .
Yet he is not easy about him ; who CAN be ? ” My dear girl had been to see us lately every day , some times twice in a day .
But we had <unk> , all along , that this would only last until I was quite myself .
We knew full well that her <unk> heart was as full of affection and gratitude towards her cousin John as it had ever been , and we <unk> Richard of laying any injunctions upon her to stay away ; but we knew on the other hand that she felt it a part of her duty to him to be sparing of her visits at our house .
My guardian ’ s delicacy had soon perceived this and had tried to <unk> to her that he thought she was right .
“ Dear , unfortunate , mistaken Richard , ” said I.
“ When will he awake from his <unk> ! ” “ He is not in the way to do so now , my dear , ” replied my guardian .
“ The more he <unk> , the more <unk> he will be to me , having made me the principal representative of the great occasion of his suffering . ” I could not help adding , “ So <unk> ! ” “ Ah , Dame Trot , Dame Trot , ” returned my guardian , “ what shall we find reasonable in Jarndyce and Jarndyce !
<unk> and injustice at the top , <unk> and injustice at the heart and at the bottom , <unk> and injustice from beginning to end — if it ever has an end — how should poor Rick , always hovering near it , <unk> reason out of it ?
He no more <unk> <unk> from <unk> or <unk> from <unk> than older men did in old times . ” His gentleness and consideration for Richard whenever we spoke of him touched me so that I was always silent on this subject very soon .
“ I suppose the Lord Chancellor , and the <unk> Chancellors , and the whole Chancery <unk> of great guns would be infinitely astonished by such <unk> and injustice in one of their suitors , ” pursued my guardian .
“ When those learned gentlemen begin to raise <unk> from the powder they <unk> in their wigs , I shall begin to be astonished too ! ” He checked himself in glancing towards the window to look where the wind was and leaned on the back of my chair instead .
“ Well , well , little woman !
To go on , my dear .
This rock we must leave to time , chance , and hopeful circumstance .
We must not shipwreck Ada upon it .
She cannot afford , and he cannot afford , the remotest chance of another separation from a friend .
Therefore I have particularly begged of Woodcourt , and I now particularly beg of you , my dear , not to move this subject with Rick .
Let it rest .
Next week , next month , next year , sooner or later , he will see me with clearer eyes .
I can wait . ” But I had already discussed it with him , I confessed ; and so , I thought , had Mr. Woodcourt .
“ So he tells me , ” returned my guardian .
“ Very good .
He has made his protest , and Dame Durden has made hers , and there is nothing more to be said about it .
Now I come to Mrs. Woodcourt .
How do you like her , my dear ? ” In answer to this question , which was <unk> <unk> , I said I liked her very much and thought she was more agreeable than she used to be .
“ I think so too , ” said my guardian .
“ <unk> <unk> ?
Not so much of Morgan <unk> — what ’ s his name ? ” That was what I meant , I acknowledged , though he was a very harmless person , even when we had had more of him .
“ Still , upon the whole , he is as well in his native mountains , ” said my guardian .
“ I agree with you .
Then , little woman , can I do better for a time than retain Mrs. Woodcourt here ? ” No .
And yet — My guardian looked at me , waiting for what I had to say .
I had nothing to say .
At least I had nothing in my mind that I could say .
I had an <unk> impression that it might have been better if we had had some other <unk> , but I could hardly have explained why even to myself .
Or , if to myself , certainly not to anybody else .
“ You see , ” said my guardian , “ our neighbourhood is in Woodcourt ’ s way , and he can come here to see her as often as he likes , which is agreeable to them both ; and she is familiar to us and fond of you . ” Yes .
That was <unk> .
I had nothing to say against it .
I could not have suggested a better arrangement , but I was not quite easy in my mind .
Esther , Esther , why not ?
Esther , think !
“ It is a very good plan indeed , dear guardian , and we could not do better . ” “ <unk> , little woman ? ” Quite sure .
I had had a moment ’ s time to think , since I had urged that duty on myself , and I was quite sure .
“ Good , ” said my guardian .
“ It shall be done .
<unk> <unk> . ” “ <unk> <unk> , ” I repeated , going on with my work .
It was a cover for his <unk> that I happened to be <unk> .
It had been laid by on the night <unk> my sad journey and never resumed .
I showed it to him now , and he admired it highly .
After I had explained the pattern to him and all the great effects that were to come out by and by , I thought I would go back to our last theme .
“ You said , dear guardian , when we spoke of Mr. Woodcourt before Ada left us , that you thought he would give a long trial to another country .
Have you been <unk> him since ? ” “ Yes , little woman , pretty often . ” “ Has he decided to do so ? ” “ I rather think not . ” “ Some other prospect has opened to him , perhaps ? ” said I.
“ Why — yes — perhaps , ” returned my guardian , beginning his answer in a very <unk> manner .
“ About half a year hence or so , there is a medical attendant for the poor to be appointed at a certain place in <unk> .
It is a <unk> place , pleasantly situated — streams and streets , town and country , mill and <unk> — and seems to present an opening for such a man .
I mean a man whose hopes and <unk> may sometimes lie ( as most men ’ s sometimes do , I dare say ) above the ordinary level , but to whom the ordinary level will be high enough after all if it should prove to be a way of <unk> and good service leading to no other .
All generous spirits are <unk> , I suppose , but the ambition that calmly trusts itself to such a road , instead of <unk> trying to fly over it , is of the kind I care for .
It is Woodcourt ’ s kind . ” “ And will he get this appointment ? ” I asked .
“ Why , little woman , ” returned my guardian , smiling , “ not being an <unk> , I cannot confidently say , but I think so .
His reputation stands very high ; there were people from that part of the country in the shipwreck ; and strange to say , I believe the best man has the best chance .
You must not suppose it to be a fine <unk> .
It is a very , very <unk> affair , my dear , an appointment to a great amount of work and a small amount of pay ; but better things will <unk> about it , it may be <unk> hoped . ” “ The poor of that place will have reason to bless the choice if it falls on Mr. Woodcourt , guardian . ” “ You are right , little woman ; that I am sure they will . ” We said no more about it , nor did he say a word about the future of Bleak House .
But it was the first time I had taken my seat at his side in my mourning dress , and that <unk> for it , I considered .
I now began to visit my dear girl every day in the dull dark corner where she lived .
The morning was my usual time , but whenever I found I had an hour or so to spare , I put on my bonnet and <unk> off to Chancery Lane .
They were both so glad to see me at all hours , and used to brighten up so when they heard me opening the door and coming in ( being quite at home , I never knocked ) , that I had no fear of becoming troublesome just yet .
On these occasions I frequently found Richard absent .
At other times he would be writing or reading papers in the cause at that table of his , so covered with papers , which was never disturbed .
Sometimes I would come upon him lingering at the door of Mr. Vholes ’ s office .
Sometimes I would meet him in the neighbourhood <unk> about and biting his <unk> .
I often met him wandering in Lincoln ’ s Inn , near the place where I had first seen him , oh how different , how different !
That the money Ada brought him was melting away with the candles I used to see burning after dark in Mr. Vholes ’ s office I knew very well .
It was not a large amount in the beginning , he had married in debt , and I could not fail to understand , by this time , what was meant by Mr. Vholes ’ s shoulder being at the wheel — as I still heard it was .
My dear made the best of <unk> and tried hard to save , but I knew that they were getting poorer and poorer every day .
She shone in the miserable corner like a beautiful star .
She <unk> and <unk> it so that it became another place .
<unk> than she had been at home , and a little quieter than I had thought natural when she was yet so cheerful and hopeful , her face was so <unk> that I half believed she was <unk> by her love for Richard to his <unk> career .
I went one day to dine with them while I was under this impression .
As I turned into Symond ’ s Inn , I met little Miss Flite coming out .
She had been to make a stately call upon the wards in Jarndyce , as she still called them , and had derived the highest gratification from that ceremony .
Ada had already told me that she called every <unk> at five o ’ clock , with one little extra white bow in her bonnet , which never appeared there at any other time , and with her <unk> reticule of documents on her arm .
“ My dear ! ” she began .
“ So delighted !
How do you do !
So glad to see you .
And you are going to visit our interesting Jarndyce wards ?
TO be sure !
Our beauty is at home , my dear , and will be charmed to see you . ” “ Then Richard is not come in yet ? ” said I.
“ I am glad of that , for I was afraid of being a little late . ” “ No , he is not come in , ” returned Miss Flite .
“ He has had a long day in court .
I left him there with Vholes .
You don ’ t like Vholes , I hope ?
DON ’ T like Vholes .
<unk> man ! ” “ I am afraid you see Richard oftener than ever now , ” said I.
“ My dearest , ” returned Miss Flite , “ daily and <unk> .
You know what I told you of the attraction on the Chancellor ’ s table ?
My dear , next to myself he is the most constant suitor in court .
He begins quite to <unk> our little party .
Ve-ry friendly little party , are we not ? ” It was miserable to hear this from her poor mad lips , though it was no surprise .
“ In short , my <unk> friend , ” pursued Miss Flite , advancing her lips to my ear with an air of equal patronage and mystery , “ I must tell you a secret .
I have made him my <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , and appointed him .
In my will .
Ye-es . ” “ Indeed ? ” said I.
“ Ye-es , ” repeated Miss Flite in her most genteel <unk> , “ my <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
( Our Chancery <unk> , my love . )
I have reflected that if I should wear out , he will be able to watch that judgment .
Being so very regular in his attendance . ” It made me sigh to think of him .
“ I did at one time mean , ” said Miss Flite , echoing the sigh , “ to <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> poor Gridley .
Also very regular , my charming girl .
I assure you , most exemplary !
But he wore out , poor man , so I have appointed his <unk> .
Don ’ t mention it .
This is in confidence . ” She carefully opened her reticule a little way and showed me a folded piece of paper inside as the appointment of which she spoke .
“ Another secret , my dear .
I have added to my collection of birds . ” “ Really , Miss Flite ? ” said I , knowing how it pleased her to have her confidence received with an appearance of interest .
She nodded several times , and her face became <unk> and gloomy .
“ Two more .
I call them the <unk> in Jarndyce .
They are <unk> up with all the others .
With <unk> , Joy , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Death , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ! ” The poor soul kissed me with the most troubled look I had ever seen in her and went her way .
Her manner of running over the names of her birds , as if she were afraid of hearing them even from her own lips , quite chilled me .
This was not a <unk> preparation for my visit , and I could have dispensed with the company of Mr. Vholes , when Richard ( who arrived within a minute or two after me ) brought him to share our dinner .
Although it was a very plain one , Ada and Richard were for some minutes both out of the room together helping to get ready what we were to eat and drink .
Mr. Vholes took that opportunity of holding a little conversation in a low voice with me .
He came to the window where I was sitting and began upon Symond ’ s Inn .
“ A dull place , Miss Summerson , for a life that is not an official one , ” said Mr. Vholes , <unk> the glass with his black glove to make it clearer for me .
“ There is not much to see here , ” said I.
“ Nor to hear , miss , ” returned Mr. Vholes .
“ A little music does occasionally stray in , but we are not musical in the law and soon <unk> it .
I hope Mr. Jarndyce is as well as his friends could wish him ? ” I thanked Mr. Vholes and said he was quite well .
“ I have not the pleasure to be admitted among the number of his friends myself , ” said Mr. Vholes , “ and I am aware that the gentlemen of our profession are sometimes regarded in such quarters with an <unk> eye .
Our plain course , however , under good report and evil report , and all kinds of prejudice ( we are the <unk> of prejudice ) , is to have everything openly carried on .
How do you find Mr. C. looking , Miss Summerson ? ” “ He looks very ill . <unk> anxious . ” “ Just so , ” said Mr. Vholes .
He stood behind me with his long black figure <unk> nearly to the ceiling of those low rooms , feeling the <unk> on his face as if they were ornaments and speaking <unk> and <unk> as though there were not a human passion or emotion in his nature .
“ Mr.
Woodcourt is in attendance upon Mr. C. , I believe ? ” he resumed .
“ Mr.
Woodcourt is his disinterested friend , ” I answered .
“ But I mean in professional attendance , medical attendance . ” “ That can do little for an unhappy mind , ” said I.
“ Just so , ” said Mr. Vholes .
So slow , so eager , so <unk> and gaunt , I felt as if Richard were <unk> away beneath the eyes of this adviser and there were something of the <unk> in him .
“ Miss Summerson , ” said Mr. Vholes , very slowly rubbing his <unk> hands , as if , to his cold sense of touch , they were much the same in black <unk> or out of it , “ this was an <unk> marriage of Mr. C. ’ s . ” I begged he would excuse me from <unk> it .
They had been engaged when they were both very young , I told him ( a little indignantly ) and when the prospect before them was much <unk> and brighter .
When Richard had not yielded himself to the unhappy influence which now darkened his life .
“ Just so , ” assented Mr. Vholes again .
“ Still , with a view to everything being openly carried on , I will , with your permission , Miss Summerson , observe to you that I consider this a very <unk> marriage indeed .
I owe the opinion not only to Mr. C. ’ s connexions , against whom I should naturally wish to protect myself , but also to my own reputation — dear to myself as a professional man <unk> to keep respectable ; dear to my three girls at home , for whom I am striving to <unk> some little independence ; dear , I will even say , to my aged father , whom it is my privilege to support . ” “ It would become a very different marriage , a much happier and better marriage , another marriage altogether , Mr. Vholes , ” said I , “ if Richard were persuaded to turn his back on the fatal pursuit in which you are engaged with him . ” Mr. Vholes , with a <unk> cough — or rather gasp — into one of his black gloves , inclined his head as if he did not wholly dispute even that .
“ Miss Summerson , ” he said , “ it may be so ; and I freely admit that the young lady who has taken Mr. C. ’ s name upon herself in so <unk> a manner — you will I am sure not quarrel with me for throwing out that remark again , as a duty I owe to Mr. C. ’ s connexions — is a highly genteel young lady .
<unk> has prevented me from <unk> much with general society in any but a professional character ; still I trust I am <unk> to perceive that she is a highly genteel young lady .
As to beauty , I am not a judge of that myself , and I never did give much attention to it from a boy , but I dare say the young lady is equally <unk> in that point of view .
She is considered so ( I have heard ) among the clerks in the Inn , and it is a point more in their way than in mine .
In reference to Mr. C. ’ s pursuit of his interests — ” “ Oh !
His interests , Mr. Vholes ! ” “ Pardon me , ” returned Mr. Vholes , going on in exactly the same inward and <unk> manner .
“ Mr.
C. takes certain interests under certain wills disputed in the suit .
It is a term we use .
In reference to Mr. <unk> , ’ s pursuit of his interests , I mentioned to you , Miss Summerson , the first time I had the pleasure of seeing you , in my desire that everything should be openly carried on — I used those words , for I happened afterwards to note them in my <unk> , which is <unk> at any time — I mentioned to you that Mr. C. had laid down the principle of watching his own interests , and that when a client of mine laid down a principle which was not of an <unk> ( that is to say , <unk> ) nature , it <unk> upon me to carry it out .
I HAVE carried it out ; I do carry it out .
But I will not smooth things over to any connexion of Mr. C. ’ s on any account .
As open as I was to Mr. Jarndyce , I am to you .
I regard it in the light of a professional duty to be so , though it can be charged to no one .
I openly say , <unk> as it may be , that I consider Mr. C. ’ s affairs in a very bad way , that I consider Mr. C. himself in a very bad way , and that I regard this as an exceedingly <unk> marriage .
Am I here , sir ?
Yes , I thank you ; I am here , Mr. C. , and enjoying the pleasure of some agreeable conversation with Miss Summerson , for which I have to thank you very much , sir ! ” He broke off thus in answer to Richard , who addressed him as he came into the room .
By this time I too well understood Mr. Vholes ’ s <unk> way of <unk> himself and his respectability not to feel that our worst fears did but keep pace with his client ’ s progress .
We sat down to dinner , and I had an opportunity of observing Richard , anxiously .
I was not disturbed by Mr. Vholes ( who took off his gloves to dine ) , though he sat opposite to me at the small table , for I doubt if , looking up at all , he once removed his eyes from his host ’ s face .
I found Richard thin and languid , <unk> in his dress , <unk> in his manner , <unk> his spirits now and then , and at other intervals relapsing into a dull <unk> .
About his large bright eyes that used to be so merry there was a <unk> and a <unk> that changed them altogether .
I cannot use the expression that he looked old .
There is a ruin of youth which is not like age , and into such a ruin Richard ’ s youth and youthful beauty had all fallen away .
He <unk> little and seemed indifferent what it was , showed himself to be much more impatient than he used to be , and was quick even with Ada .
I thought at first that his old light-hearted manner was all gone , but it shone out of him sometimes as I had occasionally known little <unk> <unk> of my own old face to look out upon me from the glass .
His laugh had not quite left him either , but it was like the echo of a joyful sound , and that is always sorrowful .
Yet he was as glad as ever , in his old affectionate way , to have me there , and we talked of the old times pleasantly .
These did not appear to be interesting to Mr. Vholes , though he occasionally made a gasp which I believe was his smile .
He rose shortly after dinner and said that with the permission of the ladies he would retire to his office .
“ Always devoted to business , Vholes ! ” cried Richard .
“ Yes , Mr. C. , ” he returned , “ the interests of clients are never to be neglected , sir .
They are <unk> in the thoughts of a professional man like myself , who wishes to preserve a good name among his <unk> and society at large .
My <unk> myself the pleasure of the present agreeable conversation may not be wholly <unk> of your own interests , Mr. C. ” Richard expressed himself quite sure of that and lighted Mr. Vholes out .
On his return he told us , more than once , that Vholes was a good fellow , a safe fellow , a man who did what he pretended to do , a very good fellow indeed !
He was so <unk> about it that it struck me he had begun to doubt Mr. Vholes .
Then he threw himself on the sofa , tired out ; and Ada and I put things to rights , for they had no other servant than the woman who attended to the chambers .
My dear girl had a cottage piano there and quietly sat down to sing some of Richard ’ s <unk> , the lamp being first removed into the next room , as he complained of its hurting his eyes .
I sat between them , at my dear girl ’ s side , and felt very melancholy listening to her sweet voice .
I think Richard did too ; I think he darkened the room for that reason .
She had been singing some time , rising between <unk> to <unk> over him and speak to him , when Mr. Woodcourt came in .
Then he sat down by Richard and half <unk> , half earnestly , quite naturally and easily , found out how he felt and where he had been all day .
Presently he proposed to accompany him in a short walk on one of the bridges , as it was a moonlight airy night ; and Richard readily <unk> , they went out together .
They left my dear girl still sitting at the piano and me still sitting beside her .
When they were gone out , I drew my arm round her waist .
She put her left hand in mine ( I was sitting on that side ) , but kept her right upon the keys , going over and over them without striking any note .
“ Esther , my dearest , ” she said , breaking silence , “ Richard is never so well and I am never so easy about him as when he is with Allan Woodcourt .
We have to thank you for that . ” I pointed out to my darling how this could scarcely be , because Mr. Woodcourt had come to her cousin John ’ s house and had known us all there , and because he had always liked Richard , and Richard had always liked him , and — and so forth .
“ All true , ” said Ada , “ but that he is such a devoted friend to us we owe to you . ” I thought it best to let my dear girl have her way and to say no more about it .
So I said as much .
I said it lightly , because I felt her trembling .
“ Esther , my dearest , I want to be a good wife , a very , very good wife indeed .
You shall teach me . ” I teach !
I said no more , for I noticed the hand that was fluttering over the keys , and I knew that it was not I who ought to speak , that it was she who had something to say to me .
“ When I married Richard I was not insensible to what was before him .
I had been perfectly happy for a long time with you , and I had never known any trouble or anxiety , so loved and cared for , but I understood the danger he was in , dear Esther . ” “ I know , I know , my darling . ” “ When we were married I had some little hope that I might be able to <unk> him of his mistake , that he might come to regard it in a new way as my husband and not pursue it all the more <unk> for my sake — as he does .
But if I had not had that hope , I would have married him just the same , Esther .
Just the same ! ” In the <unk> <unk> of the hand that was never still — a <unk> inspired by the utterance of these last words , and dying away with them — I saw the confirmation of her earnest tones .
“ You are not to think , my dearest Esther , that I fail to see what you see and fear what you fear .
No one can understand him better than I do .
The greatest wisdom that ever lived in the world could scarcely know Richard better than my love does . ” She spoke so modestly and softly and her trembling hand expressed such agitation as it moved to and fro upon the silent notes !
My dear , dear girl !
“ I see him at his worst every day .
I watch him in his sleep .
I know every change of his face .
But when I married Richard I was quite determined , Esther , if heaven would help me , never to show him that I grieved for what he did and so to make him more unhappy .
I want him , when he comes home , to find no trouble in my face .
I want him , when he looks at me , to see what he loved in me .
I married him to do this , and this <unk> me . ” I felt her trembling more .
I waited for what was yet to come , and I now thought I began to know what it was .
“ And something else <unk> me , Esther . ” She stopped a minute .
<unk> speaking only ; her hand was still in motion .
“ I look forward a little while , and I don ’ t know what great aid may come to me .
When Richard turns his eyes upon me then , there may be something lying on my breast more eloquent than I have been , with greater power than mine to show him his true course and win him back . ” Her hand stopped now .
She clasped me in her arms , and I clasped her in mine .
“ If that little creature should fail too , Esther , I still look forward .
I look forward a long while , through years and years , and think that then , when I am growing old , or when I am dead perhaps , a beautiful woman , his daughter , happily married , may be proud of him and a blessing to him .
Or that a generous brave man , as handsome as he used to be , as hopeful , and far more happy , may walk in the sunshine with him , honouring his grey head and saying to himself , ‘ I thank God this is my father !
<unk> by a fatal inheritance , and restored through me ! ’ ” Oh , my sweet girl , what a heart was that which beat so fast against me !
“ These hopes <unk> me , my dear Esther , and I know they will .
Though sometimes even they depart from me before a dread that arises when I look at Richard . ” I tried to cheer my darling , and asked her what it was .
<unk> and weeping , she replied , “ That he may not live to see his child . ” CHAPTER <unk> A Discovery The days when I <unk> that miserable corner which my dear girl brightened can never <unk> in my remembrance .
I never see it , and I never wish to see it now ; I have been there only once since , but in my memory there is a <unk> glory shining on the place which will shine for ever .
Not a day passed without my going there , of course .
At first I found Mr. Skimpole there , on two or three occasions , <unk> playing the piano and talking in his usual vivacious <unk> .
Now , besides my very much <unk> the probability of his being there without making Richard poorer , I felt as if there were something in his careless gaiety too <unk> with what I knew of the <unk> of Ada ’ s life .
I clearly perceived , too , that Ada <unk> my feelings .
I therefore resolved , after much thinking of it , to make a private visit to Mr. Skimpole and try delicately to explain myself .
My dear girl was the great consideration that made me bold .
I set off one morning , accompanied by Charley , for <unk> <unk> .
As I approached the house , I was strongly inclined to turn back , for I felt what a desperate attempt it was to make an impression on Mr. Skimpole and how extremely likely it was that he would <unk> <unk> me .
However , I thought that being there , I would go through with it .
I knocked with a trembling hand at Mr. Skimpole ’ s door — <unk> with a hand , for the <unk> was gone — and after a long <unk> gained admission from an <unk> , who was in the area when I knocked , breaking up the <unk> of a <unk> with a <unk> to light the fire with .
Mr. Skimpole , lying on the sofa in his room , playing the <unk> a little , was enchanted to see me .
Now , who should receive me , he asked .
Who would I prefer for mistress of the <unk> ?
Would I have his Comedy daughter , his Beauty daughter , or his Sentiment daughter ?
Or would I have all the daughters at once in a perfect nosegay ?
I replied , half <unk> already , that I wished to speak to himself only if he would give me leave .
“ My dear Miss Summerson , most <unk> !
Of course , ” he said , bringing his chair nearer mine and breaking into his fascinating smile , “ of course it ’ s not business .
Then it ’ s pleasure ! ” I said it certainly was not business that I came upon , but it was not quite a pleasant matter .
“ Then , my dear Miss Summerson , ” said he with the <unk> gaiety , “ don ’ t allude to it .
Why should you allude to anything that is NOT a pleasant matter ?
I never do .
And you are a much pleasanter creature , in every point of view , than I.
You are perfectly pleasant ; I am imperfectly pleasant ; then , if I never allude to an unpleasant matter , how much less should you !
So that ’ s disposed of , and we will talk of something else . ” Although I was embarrassed , I took courage to <unk> that I still wished to pursue the subject .
“ I should think it a mistake , ” said Mr. Skimpole with his airy laugh , “ if I thought Miss Summerson capable of making one .
But I don ’ t ! ” “ Mr.
Skimpole , ” said I , raising my eyes to his , “ I have so often heard you say that you are <unk> with the common affairs of life — ” “ <unk> our three <unk> friends , <unk> , S , and who ’ s the <unk> partner ?
D ? ” said Mr. Skimpole , brightly .
“ Not an idea of them ! ” “ — That perhaps , ” I went on , “ you will excuse my <unk> on that account .
I think you ought most seriously to know that Richard is poorer than he was . ” “ Dear me ! ” said Mr. Skimpole .
“ So am I , they tell me . ” “ And in very embarrassed circumstances . ” “ <unk> case , exactly ! ” said Mr. Skimpole with a delighted countenance .
“ This at present naturally causes Ada much secret anxiety , and as I think she is less anxious when no claims are made upon her by visitors , and as Richard has one uneasiness always heavy on his mind , it has occurred to me to take the liberty of saying that — if you would — not — ” I was coming to the point with great difficulty when he took me by both hands and with a radiant face and in the <unk> way anticipated it .
“ Not go there ?
Certainly not , my dear Miss Summerson , most assuredly not .
Why <unk> I go there ?
When I go anywhere , I go for pleasure .
I don ’ t go anywhere for pain , because I was made for pleasure .
<unk> comes to ME when it wants me .
Now , I have had very little pleasure at our dear Richard ’ s lately , and your practical <unk> <unk> why .
Our young friends , losing the youthful poetry which was once so captivating in them , begin to think , ‘ This is a man who wants pounds . ’ So I am ; I always want pounds ; not for myself , but because <unk> always want them of me .
Next , our young friends begin to think , becoming <unk> , ‘ This is the man who HAD pounds , who borrowed them , ’ which I did .
I always borrow pounds .
So our young friends , <unk> to prose ( which is much to be regretted ) , <unk> in their power of <unk> pleasure to me .
Why should I go to see them , therefore ?
<unk> ! ” Through the <unk> smile with which he regarded me as he <unk> thus , there now broke forth a look of disinterested benevolence quite astonishing .
“ Besides , ” he said , pursuing his argument in his tone of light-hearted conviction , “ if I don ’ t go anywhere for pain — which would be a <unk> of the intention of my being , and a monstrous thing to do — why should I go anywhere to be the cause of pain ?
If I went to see our young friends in their present <unk> state of mind , I should give them pain .
The <unk> with me would be disagreeable .
They might say , ‘ This is the man who had pounds and who can ’ t pay pounds , ’ which I can ’ t , of course ; nothing could be more out of the question !
Then kindness requires that I shouldn ’ t go near them — and I won ’ t . ” He finished by <unk> kissing my hand and thanking me .
Nothing but Miss Summerson ’ s fine tact , he said , would have found this out for him .
I was much disconcerted , but I reflected that if the main point were gained , it <unk> little how strangely he <unk> everything leading to it .
I had determined to mention something else , however , and I thought I was not to be put off in that .
“ Mr.
Skimpole , ” said I , “ I must take the liberty of saying before I conclude my visit that I was much surprised to learn , on the best authority , some little time ago , that you knew with whom that poor boy left Bleak House and that you accepted a present on that occasion .
I have not mentioned it to my guardian , for I fear it would hurt him <unk> ; but I may say to you that I was much surprised . ” “ No ?
Really surprised , my dear Miss Summerson ? ” he returned inquiringly , raising his pleasant eyebrows .
“ <unk> surprised . ” He thought about it for a little while with a highly agreeable and <unk> expression of face , then quite gave it up and said in his most engaging manner , “ You know what a child I am .
Why surprised ? ” I was <unk> to enter <unk> into that question , but as he begged I would , for he was really curious to know , I gave him to understand in the <unk> words I could use that his conduct seemed to involve a <unk> of several moral obligations .
He was much amused and interested when he heard this and said , “ No , really ? ” with ingenuous simplicity .
“ You know I don ’ t intend to be responsible .
I never could do it .
<unk> is a thing that has always been above me — or below me , ” said Mr. Skimpole .
“ I don ’ t even know which ; but as I understand the way in which my dear Miss Summerson ( always remarkable for her practical good sense and <unk> ) puts this case , I should imagine it was chiefly a question of money , do you know ? ” I <unk> gave a <unk> assent to this .
“ Ah !
Then you see , ” said Mr. Skimpole , shaking his head , “ I am hopeless of understanding it . ” I suggested , as I rose to go , that it was not right to <unk> my guardian ’ s confidence for a <unk> .
“ My dear Miss Summerson , ” he returned with a candid <unk> that was all his own , “ I can ’ t be <unk> . ” “ Not by Mr. Bucket ? ” said I.
“ No , ” said he .
“ Not by anybody .
I don ’ t <unk> any value to money .
I don ’ t care about it , I don ’ t know about it , I don ’ t want it , I don ’ t keep it — it goes away from me directly .
How can I be <unk> ? ” I showed that I was of a different opinion , though I had not the capacity for arguing the question .
“ On the contrary , ” said Mr. Skimpole , “ I am exactly the man to be placed in a superior position in such a case as that .
I am above the rest of mankind in such a case as that .
I can act with philosophy in such a case as that .
I am not <unk> by <unk> , as an Italian baby is by <unk> .
I am as free as the air .
I feel myself as far above suspicion as <unk> ’ s wife . ” Anything to equal the <unk> of his manner and the playful <unk> with which he seemed to <unk> himself , as he <unk> the matter about like a ball of feathers , was surely never seen in anybody else !
“ <unk> the case , my dear Miss Summerson .
Here is a boy received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to .
The boy being in bed , a man arrives — like the house that <unk> built .
Here is the man who demands the boy who is received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to .
Here is a <unk> produced by the man who demands the boy who is received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to .
Here is the Skimpole who <unk> the <unk> produced by the man who demands the boy who is received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to .
Those are the facts .
Very well .
<unk> the Skimpole have refused the note ?
<unk> should the Skimpole have refused the note ?
Skimpole <unk> to Bucket , ‘ What ’ s this for ?
I don ’ t understand it , it is of no use to me , take it away . ’ Bucket still <unk> Skimpole to accept it .
Are there reasons why Skimpole , not being <unk> by <unk> , should accept it ?
Yes .
Skimpole perceives them .
What are they ?
Skimpole reasons with himself , this is a <unk> <unk> , an active <unk> , an intelligent man , a person of a <unk> directed energy and great <unk> both of <unk> and <unk> , who <unk> our friends and enemies for us when they run away , recovers our property for us when we are robbed , <unk> us comfortably when we are murdered .
This active <unk> and intelligent man has acquired , in the exercise of his art , a strong faith in money ; he finds it very useful to him , and he makes it very useful to society .
Shall I shake that faith in Bucket because I want it myself ; shall I deliberately <unk> one of Bucket ’ s weapons ; shall I positively <unk> Bucket in his next <unk> <unk> ?
And again .
If it is <unk> in Skimpole to take the note , it is <unk> in Bucket to offer the note — much more <unk> in Bucket , because he is the knowing man .
Now , Skimpole wishes to think well of Bucket ; Skimpole <unk> it essential , in its little place , to the general <unk> of things , that he <unk> think well of Bucket .
The state expressly asks him to trust to Bucket .
And he does .
And that ’ s all he does ! ” I had nothing to offer in reply to this <unk> and therefore took my leave .
Mr. Skimpole , however , who was in excellent spirits , would not hear of my returning home attended only by “ Little Coavinses , ” and accompanied me himself .
He entertained me on the way with a variety of delightful conversation and assured me , at parting , that he should never forget the fine tact with which I had found that out for him about our young friends .
As it so happened that I never saw Mr. Skimpole again , I may at once finish what I know of his history .
A coolness arose between him and my guardian , <unk> principally on the <unk> grounds and on his having <unk> <unk> my guardian ’ s entreaties ( as we afterwards learned from Ada ) in reference to Richard .
His being heavily in my guardian ’ s debt had nothing to do with their separation .
He died some five years afterwards and left a <unk> behind him , with letters and other <unk> towards his life , which was published and which showed him to have been the victim of a <unk> on the part of mankind against an amiable child .
It was considered very pleasant reading , but I never read more of it myself than the sentence on which I <unk> to light on opening the book .
It was this : “ Jarndyce , in common with most other men I have known , is the <unk> of <unk> . ” And now I come to a part of my story touching myself very nearly indeed , and for which I was quite unprepared when the circumstance occurred .
Whatever little <unk> may have now and then revived in my mind associated with my poor old face had only revived as belonging to a part of my life that was gone — gone like my <unk> or my childhood .
I have suppressed none of my many weaknesses on that subject , but have written them as faithfully as my memory has recalled them .
And I hope to do , and mean to do , the same down to the last words of these pages , which I see now not so very far before me .
The months were gliding away , and my dear girl , <unk> by the hopes she had confided in me , was the same beautiful star in the miserable corner .
Richard , more worn and haggard , <unk> the court day after day , <unk> sat there the whole day long when he knew there was no remote chance of the suit being mentioned , and became one of the stock <unk> of the place .
I wonder whether any of the gentlemen remembered him as he was when he first went there .
So completely was he absorbed in his fixed idea that he used to <unk> in his cheerful moments that he should never have breathed the fresh air now “ but for Woodcourt . ” It was only Mr. Woodcourt who could occasionally <unk> his attention for a few hours at a time and <unk> him , even when he sunk into a <unk> of mind and body that alarmed us greatly , and the returns of which became more frequent as the months went on .
My dear girl was right in saying that he only pursued his errors the more <unk> for her sake .
I have no doubt that his desire to <unk> what he had lost was rendered the more intense by his grief for his young wife , and became like the <unk> of a <unk> .
I was there , as I have mentioned , at all hours .
When I was there at night , I generally went home with Charley in a coach ; sometimes my guardian would meet me in the neighbourhood , and we would walk home together .
One evening he had arranged to meet me at eight o ’ clock .
I could not leave , as I usually did , quite <unk> at the time , for I was working for my dear girl and had a few <unk> more to do to finish what I was about ; but it was within a few minutes of the hour when I <unk> up my little <unk> , gave my darling my last kiss for the night , and hurried downstairs .
Mr. Woodcourt went with me , as it was dusk .
When we came to the usual place of meeting — it was close by , and Mr. Woodcourt had often accompanied me before — my guardian was not there .
We waited half an hour , walking up and down , but there were no signs of him .
We agreed that he was either prevented from coming or that he had come and gone away , and Mr. Woodcourt proposed to walk home with me .
It was the first walk we had ever taken together , except that very short one to the usual place of meeting .
We spoke of Richard and Ada the whole way .
I did not thank him in words for what he had done — my appreciation of it had risen above all words then — but I hoped he might not be without some understanding of what I felt so strongly .
<unk> at home and going upstairs , we found that my guardian was out and that Mrs. Woodcourt was out too .
We were in the very same room into which I had brought my blushing girl when her youthful lover , now her so altered husband , was the choice of her young heart , the very same room from which my guardian and I had watched them going away through the sunlight in the fresh bloom of their hope and promise .
We were standing by the opened window looking down into the street when Mr. Woodcourt spoke to me .
I learned in a moment that he loved me .
I learned in a moment that my <unk> face was all <unk> to him .
I learned in a moment that what I had thought was pity and compassion was devoted , generous , faithful love .
Oh , too late to know it now , too late , too late .
That was the first ungrateful thought I had .
<unk> late .
“ When I returned , ” he told me , “ when I came back , no richer than when I went away , and found you newly risen from a sick bed , yet so inspired by sweet consideration for others and so free from a selfish thought — ” “ Oh , Mr. Woodcourt , <unk> , <unk> ! ” I entreated him .
“ I do not <unk> your high praise .
I had many selfish thoughts at that time , many ! ” “ Heaven knows , beloved of my life , ” said he , “ that my praise is not a lover ’ s praise , but the truth .
You do not know what all around you see in Esther Summerson , how many hearts she touches and <unk> , what sacred admiration and what love she <unk> . ” “ Oh , Mr. Woodcourt , ” cried I , “ it is a great thing to win love , it is a great thing to win love !
I am proud of it , and honoured by it ; and the hearing of it causes me to shed these tears of mingled joy and sorrow — joy that I have won it , sorrow that I have not <unk> it better ; but I am not free to think of yours . ” I said it with a stronger heart , for when he praised me thus and when I heard his voice <unk> with his belief that what he said was true , I aspired to be more worthy of it .
It was not too late for that .
Although I closed this <unk> page in my life to-night , I could be <unk> of it all through my life .
And it was a comfort to me , and an impulse to me , and I felt a dignity rise up within me that was derived from him when I thought so .
He broke the silence .
“ I should poorly show the trust that I have in the dear one who will evermore be as dear to me as now ” — and the deep earnestness with which he said it at once strengthened me and made me <unk> — “ if , after her assurance that she is not free to think of my love , I urged it .
Dear Esther , let me only tell you that the fond idea of you which I took abroad was <unk> to the <unk> when I came home .
I have always hoped , in the first hour when I seemed to stand in any ray of good fortune , to tell you this .
I have always feared that I should tell it you in vain .
My hopes and fears are both <unk> to-night .
I distress you .
I have said enough . ” Something seemed to pass into my place that was like the angel he thought me , and I felt so sorrowful for the loss he had <unk> !
I wished to help him in his trouble , as I had wished to do when he showed that first <unk> for me .
“ Dear Mr. Woodcourt , ” said I , “ before we part to-night , something is left for me to say .
I never could say it as I wish — I never shall — but — ” I had to think again of being more <unk> of his love and his affliction before I could go on .
“ — I am deeply sensible of your generosity , and I shall <unk> its remembrance to my dying hour .
I know full well how changed I am , I know you are not <unk> with my history , and I know what a noble love that is which is so faithful .
What you have said to me could have affected me so much from no other lips , for there are none that could give it such a value to me .
It shall not be lost .
It shall make me better . ” He covered his eyes with his hand and turned away his head .
How could I ever be worthy of those tears ?
“ If , in the <unk> <unk> we shall have together — in <unk> Richard and Ada , and I hope in many happier <unk> of life — you ever find anything in me which you can <unk> think is better than it used to be , believe that it will have <unk> up from to-night and that I shall owe it to you .
And never believe , dear dear Mr. Woodcourt , never believe that I forget this night or that while my heart beats it can be insensible to the pride and joy of having been beloved by you . ” He took my hand and kissed it .
He was like himself again , and I felt still more encouraged .
“ I am induced by what you said just now , ” said I , “ to hope that you have succeeded in your endeavour . ” “ I have , ” he answered .
“ With such help from Mr. Jarndyce as you who know him so well can imagine him to have rendered me , I have succeeded . ” “ Heaven bless him for it , ” said I , giving him my hand ; “ and heaven bless you in all you do ! ” “ I shall do it better for the wish , ” he answered ; “ it will make me enter on these new duties as on another sacred trust from you . ” “ Ah !
Richard ! ” I exclaimed <unk> , “ What will he do when you are gone ! ” “ I am not required to go yet ; I would not desert him , dear Miss Summerson , even if I were . ” One other thing I felt it <unk> to touch upon before he left me .
I knew that I should not be <unk> of the love I could not take if I reserved it .
“ Mr.
Woodcourt , ” said I , “ you will be glad to know from my lips before I say good night that in the future , which is clear and bright before me , I am most happy , most fortunate , have nothing to regret or desire . ” It was indeed a glad hearing to him , he replied .
“ From my childhood I have been , ” said I , “ the object of the <unk> goodness of the best of human <unk> , to whom I am so bound by every tie of attachment , gratitude , and love , that nothing I could do in the <unk> of a life could express the feelings of a single day . ” “ I share those feelings , ” he returned .
“ You speak of Mr. Jarndyce . ” “ You know his virtues well , ” said I , “ but few can know the greatness of his character as I know it .
All its highest and best qualities have been revealed to me in nothing more brightly than in the <unk> out of that future in which I am so happy .
And if your highest homage and respect had not been his already — which I know they are — they would have been his , I think , on this assurance and in the feeling it would have awakened in you towards him for my sake . ” He <unk> replied that indeed indeed they would have been .
I gave him my hand again .
“ Good night , ” I said , “ Good-bye . ” “ The first until we meet to-morrow , the second as a farewell to this theme between us for ever . ” “ Yes . ” “ Good night ; good-bye . ” He left me , and I stood at the dark window watching the street .
His love , in all its constancy and generosity , had come so suddenly upon me that he had not left me a minute when my <unk> gave way again and the street was blotted out by my rushing tears .
But they were not tears of regret and sorrow .
No .
He had called me the beloved of his life and had said I would be evermore as dear to him as I was then , and I felt as if my heart would not hold the triumph of having heard those words .
My first wild thought had died away .
It was not too late to hear them , for it was not too late to be animated by them to be good , true , grateful , and contented .
How easy my path , how much easier than his !
CHAPTER <unk> Another Discovery I had not the courage to see any one that night .
I had not even the courage to see myself , for I was afraid that my tears might a little reproach me .
I went up to my room in the dark , and prayed in the dark , and lay down in the dark to sleep .
I had no need of any light to read my guardian ’ s letter by , for I knew it by heart .
I took it from the place where I kept it , and repeated its contents by its own clear light of <unk> and love , and went to sleep with it on my pillow .
I was up very early in the morning and called Charley to come for a walk .
We bought flowers for the <unk> , and came back and arranged them , and were as busy as possible .
We were so early that I had a good time still for Charley ’ s lesson before breakfast ; Charley ( who was not in the least improved in the old defective article of <unk> ) came through it with great <unk> ; and we were altogether very <unk> .
When my guardian appeared he said , “ Why , little woman , you look <unk> than your flowers ! ” And Mrs. Woodcourt repeated and <unk> a passage from the <unk> expressive of my being like a <unk> with the sun upon it .
This was all so pleasant that I hope it made me still more like the <unk> than I had been before .
After breakfast I waited my opportunity and <unk> about a little until I saw my guardian in his own room — the room of last night — by himself .
Then I made an excuse to go in with my housekeeping keys , shutting the door after me .
“ Well , Dame Durden ? ” said my guardian ; the post had brought him several letters , and he was writing .
“ You want money ? ” “ No , indeed , I have plenty in hand . ” “ There never was such a Dame Durden , ” said my guardian , “ for making money last . ” He had laid down his pen and leaned back in his chair looking at me .
I have often spoken of his bright face , but I thought I had never seen it look so bright and good .
There was a high happiness upon it which made me think , “ He has been doing some great kindness this morning . ” “ There never was , ” said my guardian , musing as he smiled upon me , “ such a Dame Durden for making money last . ” He had never yet altered his old manner .
I loved it and him so much that when I now went up to him and took my usual chair , which was always put at his side — for sometimes I read to him , and sometimes I talked to him , and sometimes I silently worked by him — I hardly liked to disturb it by laying my hand on his breast .
But I found I did not disturb it at all .
“ Dear guardian , ” said I , “ I want to speak to you .
Have I been <unk> in anything ? ” “ <unk> in anything , my dear ! ” “ Have I not been what I have meant to be since — I brought the answer to your letter , guardian ? ” “ You have been everything I could desire , my love . ” “ I am very glad indeed to hear that , ” I returned .
“ You know , you said to me , was this the mistress of Bleak House .
And I said , yes . ” “ Yes , ” said my guardian , nodding his head .
He had put his arm about me as if there were something to protect me from and looked in my face , smiling .
“ Since then , ” said I , “ we have never spoken on the subject except once . ” “ And then I said Bleak House was <unk> fast ; and so it was , my dear . ” “ And I said , ” I timidly reminded him , “ but its mistress remained . ” He still held me in the same <unk> manner and with the same bright goodness in his face .
“ Dear guardian , ” said I , “ I know how you have felt all that has happened , and how considerate you have been .
As so much time has passed , and as you spoke only this morning of my being so well again , perhaps you expect me to renew the subject .
Perhaps I ought to do so .
I will be the mistress of Bleak House when you please . ” “ See , ” he returned gaily , “ what a sympathy there must be between us !
I have had nothing else , poor Rick <unk> — it ’ s a large <unk> — in my mind .
When you came in , I was full of it .
When shall we give Bleak House its mistress , little woman ? ” “ When you please . ” “ Next month ? ” “ Next month , dear guardian . ” “ The day on which I take the happiest and best step of my life — the day on which I shall be a man more <unk> and more <unk> than any other man in the world — the day on which I give Bleak House its little mistress — shall be next month then , ” said my guardian .
I put my arms round his neck and kissed him just as I had done on the day when I brought my answer .
A servant came to the door to <unk> Mr. Bucket , which was quite unnecessary , for Mr. Bucket was already looking in over the servant ’ s shoulder .
“ Mr.
Jarndyce and Miss Summerson , ” said he , rather out of breath , “ with all <unk> for <unk> , WILL you allow me to order up a person that ’ s on the stairs and that objects to being left there in case of becoming the subject of observations in his absence ?
Thank you .
Be so good as chair that there member in this direction , will you ? ” said Mr. Bucket , <unk> over the <unk> .
This singular request produced an old man in a black skull-cap , unable to walk , who was carried up by a couple of bearers and deposited in the room near the door .
Mr. Bucket immediately got rid of the bearers , mysteriously shut the door , and <unk> it .
“ Now you see , Mr. Jarndyce , ” he then began , putting down his hat and opening his subject with a <unk> of his <unk> finger , “ you know me , and Miss Summerson knows me .
This gentleman likewise knows me , and his name is Smallweed .
The <unk> line is his line principally , and he ’ s what you may call a <unk> in bills .
That ’ s about what YOU are , you know , ain ’ t you ? ” said Mr. Bucket , stopping a little to address the gentleman in question , who was exceedingly suspicious of him .
He seemed about to dispute this <unk> of himself when he was seized with a violent fit of coughing .
“ Now , moral , you know ! ” said Mr. Bucket , improving the accident .
“ Don ’ t you <unk> when there ain ’ t no occasion , and you won ’ t be took in that way .
Now , Mr. Jarndyce , I address myself to you .
I ’ ve been <unk> with this gentleman on behalf of Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and one way and another I ’ ve been in and out and about his premises a deal .
His premises are the premises formerly occupied by Krook , <unk> <unk> <unk> — a relation of this gentleman ’ s that you saw in his lifetime if I don ’ t mistake ? ” My guardian replied , “ Yes . ” “ Well !
You are to understand , ” said Mr. Bucket , “ that this gentleman he come into Krook ’ s property , and a good deal of <unk> property there was .
<unk> <unk> of waste-paper among the rest .
Lord bless you , of no use to nobody ! ” The <unk> of Mr. Bucket ’ s eye and the masterly manner in which he <unk> , without a look or a word against which his watchful <unk> could protest , to let us know that he stated the case according to previous agreement and could say much more of Mr. Smallweed if he thought it <unk> , <unk> us of any merit in quite understanding him .
His difficulty was increased by Mr. Smallweed ’ s being deaf as well as suspicious and watching his face with the <unk> attention .
“ Among them odd heaps of old papers , this gentleman , when he comes into the property , naturally begins to <unk> , don ’ t you see ? ” said Mr. Bucket .
“ To which ?
Say that again , ” cried Mr. Smallweed in a shrill , sharp voice .
“ To <unk> , ” repeated Mr. Bucket .
“ Being a prudent man and accustomed to take care of your own affairs , you begin to <unk> among the papers as you have come into ; don ’ t you ? ” “ Of course I do , ” cried Mr. Smallweed .
“ Of course you do , ” said Mr. Bucket <unk> , “ and much to blame you would be if you didn ’ t .
And so you chance to find , you know , ” Mr. Bucket went on , stooping over him with an air of cheerful <unk> which Mr. Smallweed by no means <unk> , “ and so you chance to find , you know , a paper with the <unk> of Jarndyce to it .
Don ’ t you ? ” Mr. Smallweed glanced with a troubled eye at us and <unk> nodded assent .
“ And coming to look at that paper at your full leisure and <unk> — all in good time , for you ’ re not curious to read it , and why should you be ? — what do you find it to be but a will , you see .
That ’ s the <unk> of it , ” said Mr. Bucket with the same lively air of <unk> a joke for the enjoyment of Mr. Smallweed , who still had the same <unk> appearance of not enjoying it at all ; “ what do you find it to be but a will ? ” “ I don ’ t know that it ’ s good as a will or as anything else , ” <unk> Mr. Smallweed .
Mr. Bucket eyed the old man for a moment — he had slipped and <unk> down in his chair into a mere bundle — as if he were much disposed to <unk> upon him ; <unk> , he continued to <unk> over him with the same agreeable air , keeping the corner of one of his eyes upon us .
“ <unk> which , ” said Mr. Bucket , “ you get a little doubtful and uncomfortable in your mind about it , having a very tender mind of your own . ” “ Eh ?
What do you say I have got of my own ? ” asked Mr. Smallweed with his hand to his ear .
“ A very tender mind . ” “ Ho !
Well , go on , ” said Mr. Smallweed .
“ And as you ’ ve heard a good deal mentioned regarding a celebrated Chancery will case of the same name , and as you know what a card Krook was for buying all manner of old pieces of <unk> , and books , and papers , and what not , and never liking to part with ’ em , and always a-going to teach himself to read , you begin to think — and you never was more correct in your born days — ‘ <unk> , if I don ’ t look about me , I may get into trouble regarding this will . ’ ” “ Now , mind how you put it , Bucket , ” cried the old man anxiously with his hand at his ear .
“ Speak up ; none of your brimstone <unk> .
<unk> me up ; I want to hear better .
Oh , Lord , I am shaken to bits ! ” Mr. Bucket had certainly picked him up at a <unk> .
However , as soon as he could be heard through Mr. Smallweed ’ s coughing and his <unk> <unk> of “ Oh , my bones !
Oh , dear !
I ’ ve no breath in my body !
I ’ m worse than the chattering , <unk> , brimstone pig at home ! ” Mr. Bucket proceeded in the same <unk> manner as before .
“ So , as I happen to be in the habit of coming about your premises , you take me into your confidence , don ’ t you ? ” I think it would be impossible to make an admission with more ill will and a worse grace than Mr. Smallweed <unk> when he admitted this , rendering it perfectly evident that Mr. Bucket was the very last person he would have thought of taking into his confidence if he could by any possibility have kept him out of it .
“ And I go into the business with you — very pleasant we are over it ; and I confirm you in your <unk> fears that you will get yourself into a most precious line if you don ’ t come out with that there will , ” said Mr. Bucket <unk> ; “ and accordingly you arrange with me that it shall be delivered up to this present Mr. Jarndyce , on no conditions .
If it should prove to be <unk> , you trusting yourself to him for your reward ; that ’ s about where it is , ain ’ t it ? ” “ That ’ s what was agreed , ” Mr. Smallweed assented with the same bad grace .
“ In consequence of which , ” said Mr. Bucket , <unk> his agreeable manner all at once and becoming strictly business-like , “ you ’ ve got that will upon your person at the present time , and the only thing that remains for you to do is just to out with it ! ” Having given us one glance out of the watching corner of his eye , and having given his nose one triumphant rub with his forefinger , Mr. Bucket stood with his eyes fastened on his confidential friend and his hand stretched forth ready to take the paper and present it to my guardian .
It was not produced without much <unk> and many <unk> on the part of Mr. Smallweed that he was a poor industrious man and that he left it to Mr. Jarndyce ’ s honour not to let him lose by his <unk> .
Little by little he very slowly took from a <unk> a stained , discoloured paper which was much <unk> upon the outside and a little burnt at the <unk> , as if it had long ago been thrown upon a fire and hastily <unk> off again .
Mr. Bucket lost no time in <unk> this paper , with the <unk> of a <unk> , from Mr. Smallweed to Mr. Jarndyce .
As he gave it to my guardian , he whispered behind his fingers , “ Hadn ’ t settled how to make their <unk> of it .
<unk> and hinted about it .
I laid out twenty pound upon it .
First the <unk> <unk> <unk> upon him on account of their objections to his living so <unk> long , and then they <unk> on one another .
Lord !
There ain ’ t one of the family that wouldn ’ t sell the other for a pound or two , except the old lady — and she ’ s only out of it because she ’ s too weak in her mind to drive a bargain . ” “ Mr Bucket , ” said my guardian aloud , “ whatever the worth of this paper may be to any one , my obligations are great to you ; and if it be of any worth , I hold myself bound to see Mr. Smallweed <unk> accordingly . ” “ Not according to your merits , you know , ” said Mr. Bucket in friendly explanation to Mr. Smallweed .
“ Don ’ t you be afraid of that .
<unk> to its value . ” “ That is what I mean , ” said my guardian .
“ You may observe , Mr. Bucket , that I <unk> from examining this paper myself .
The plain truth is , I have <unk> and <unk> the whole business these many years , and my soul is sick of it .
But Miss Summerson and I will immediately place the paper in the hands of my solicitor in the cause , and its existence shall be made known without delay to all other parties interested . ” “ Mr.
Jarndyce can ’ t say <unk> than that , you understand , ” observed Mr. Bucket to his <unk> .
“ And it being now made clear to you that nobody ’ s a-going to be <unk> — which must be a great relief to YOUR mind — we may proceed with the ceremony of <unk> you home again . ” He <unk> the door , called in the bearers , wished us good morning , and with a look full of meaning and a crook of his finger at parting went his way .
We went our way too , which was to Lincoln ’ s Inn , as quickly as possible .
Mr. Kenge was <unk> , and we found him at his table in his dusty room with the <unk> books and the piles of papers .
<unk> having been placed for us by Mr. Guppy , Mr. Kenge expressed the surprise and gratification he felt at the unusual sight of Mr. Jarndyce in his office .
He turned over his double eye-glass as he spoke and was more Conversation Kenge than ever .
“ I hope , ” said Mr. Kenge , “ that the genial influence of Miss Summerson , ” he bowed to me , “ may have induced Mr. Jarndyce , ” he bowed to him , “ to <unk> some little of his <unk> towards a cause and towards a court which are — shall I say , which take their place in the stately <unk> of the <unk> of our profession ? ” “ I am inclined to think , ” returned my guardian , “ that Miss Summerson has seen too much of the effects of the court and the cause to <unk> any influence in their favour .
Nevertheless , they are a part of the occasion of my being here .
Mr. Kenge , before I lay this paper on your desk and have done with it , let me tell you how it has come into my hands . ” He did so shortly and distinctly .
“ It could not , sir , ” said Mr. Kenge , “ have been stated more plainly and to the purpose if it had been a case at law . ” “ Did you ever know English law , or equity either , plain and to the purpose ? ” said my guardian .
“ Oh , <unk> ! ” said Mr. Kenge .
At first he had not seemed to <unk> much importance to the paper , but when he saw it he appeared more interested , and when he had opened and read a little of it through his eye-glass , he became amazed .
“ Mr.
Jarndyce , ” he said , looking off it , “ you have <unk> this ? ” “ Not I ! ” returned my guardian .
“ But , my dear sir , ” said Mr. Kenge , “ it is a will of later date than any in the suit .
It appears to be all in the <unk> ’ s handwriting .
It is <unk> executed and <unk> .
And even if intended to be <unk> , as might possibly be supposed to be <unk> by these marks of fire , it is NOT <unk> .
Here it is , a perfect instrument ! ” “ Well ! ” said my guardian .
“ What is that to me ? ” “ Mr.
Guppy ! ” cried Mr. Kenge , raising his voice .
“ I beg your pardon , Mr. Jarndyce . ” “ Sir . ” “ Mr.
Vholes of Symond ’ s Inn .
My compliments .
Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
Glad to speak with him . ” Mr. Guppy disappeared .
“ You ask me what is this to you , Mr. Jarndyce .
If you had <unk> this document , you would have seen that it <unk> your interest considerably , though still leaving it a very handsome one , still leaving it a very handsome one , ” said Mr. Kenge , waving his hand <unk> and <unk> .
“ You would further have seen that the interests of Mr. Richard Carstone and of Miss Ada Clare , now Mrs. Richard Carstone , are very <unk> advanced by it . ” “ Kenge , ” said my guardian , “ if all the <unk> wealth that the suit brought into this <unk> court of Chancery could fall to my two young cousins , I should be well contented .
But do you ask ME to believe that any good is to come of Jarndyce and Jarndyce ? ” “ Oh , really , Mr. Jarndyce !
<unk> , prejudice .
My dear sir , this is a very great country , a very great country .
Its system of equity is a very great system , a very great system .
Really , really ! ” My guardian said no more , and Mr. Vholes arrived .
He was modestly impressed by Mr. Kenge ’ s professional <unk> .
“ How do you do , Mr. Vholes ?
Will you be so good as to take a chair here by me and look over this paper ? ” Mr. Vholes did as he was asked and seemed to read it every word .
He was not excited by it , but he was not excited by anything .
When he had well examined it , he retired with Mr. Kenge into a window , and shading his mouth with his black glove , spoke to him at some length .
I was not surprised to observe Mr. Kenge inclined to dispute what he said before he had said much , for I knew that no two people ever did agree about anything in Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
But he seemed to get the better of Mr. Kenge too in a conversation that sounded as if it were almost composed of the words “ <unk> , ” “ <unk> , ” “ report , ” “ estate , ” and “ costs . ” When they had finished , they came back to Mr. Kenge ’ s table and spoke aloud .
“ Well !
But this is a very remarkable document , Mr. Vholes , ” said Mr. Kenge .
Mr. Vholes said , “ Very much so . ” “ And a very important document , Mr. Vholes , ” said Mr. Kenge .
Again Mr. Vholes said , “ Very much so . ” “ And as you say , Mr. Vholes , when the cause is in the paper next term , this document will be an unexpected and interesting feature in it , ” said Mr. Kenge , looking <unk> at my guardian .
Mr. Vholes was gratified , as a smaller practitioner striving to keep respectable , to be confirmed in any opinion of his own by such an authority .
“ And when , ” asked my guardian , rising after a pause , during which Mr. Kenge had rattled his money and Mr. Vholes had picked his <unk> , “ when is next term ? ” “ Next term , Mr. Jarndyce , will be next month , ” said Mr. Kenge .
“ Of course we shall at once proceed to do what is necessary with this document and to <unk> the necessary evidence concerning it ; and of course you will receive our usual <unk> of the cause being in the paper . ” “ To which I shall pay , of course , my usual attention . ” “ Still bent , my dear sir , ” said Mr. Kenge , showing us through the outer office to the door , “ still bent , even with your <unk> mind , on echoing a popular prejudice ?
We are a prosperous community , Mr. Jarndyce , a very prosperous community .
We are a great country , Mr. Jarndyce , we are a very great country .
This is a great system , Mr. Jarndyce , and would you wish a great country to have a little system ?
Now , really , really ! ” He said this at the <unk> , gently moving his right hand as if it were a silver <unk> with which to spread the <unk> of his words on the <unk> of the system and <unk> it for a thousand ages .
CHAPTER <unk> Steel and <unk> George ’ s Shooting Gallery is to let , and the stock is sold off , and George himself is at Chesney Wold attending on Sir Leicester in his <unk> and riding very near his <unk> because of the uncertain hand with which he <unk> his horse .
But not to-day is George so occupied .
He is <unk> to-day into the iron country farther north to look about him .
As he comes into the iron country farther north , such fresh green woods as those of Chesney Wold are left behind ; and coal <unk> and ashes , high chimneys and red bricks , blighted <unk> , <unk> fires , and a heavy <unk> cloud of smoke become the features of the <unk> .
Among such objects <unk> the trooper , looking about him and always looking for something he has come to find .
At last , on the black <unk> bridge of a busy town , with a <unk> of iron in it , and more fires and more smoke than he has seen yet , the trooper , <unk> with the dust of the coal roads , checks his horse and asks a workman does he know the name of Rouncewell <unk> .
“ Why , master , ” quoth the workman , “ do I know my own name ? ” “ ’ Tis so well known here , is it , comrade ? ” asks the trooper .
“ Rouncewell ’ s ?
Ah !
You ’ re right . ” “ And where might it be now ? ” asks the trooper with a glance before him .
“ The bank , the factory , or the house ? ” the workman wants to know .
“ Hum !
Rouncewell ’ s is so great apparently , ” mutters the trooper , <unk> his chin , “ that I have as good as half a mind to go back again .
Why , I don ’ t know which I want .
<unk> I find Mr. Rouncewell at the factory , do you think ? ” “ <unk> ’ t easy to say where you ’ d find him — at this time of the day you might find either him or his son there , if he ’ s in town ; but his <unk> take him away . ” And which is the factory ?
Why , he sees those chimneys — the <unk> ones !
Yes , he sees <unk> .
Well !
Let him keep his eye on those chimneys , going on as straight as ever he can , and presently he ’ ll see ’ em down a turning on the left , shut in by a great brick wall which forms one side of the street .
That ’ s Rouncewell ’ s .
The trooper thanks his <unk> and <unk> slowly on , looking about him .
He does not turn back , but puts up his horse ( and is much disposed to <unk> him too ) at a public-house where some of Rouncewell ’ s hands are <unk> , as the <unk> tells him .
Some of Rouncewell ’ s hands have just knocked off for <unk> and seem to be <unk> the whole town .
They are very <unk> and strong , are Rouncewell ’ s hands — a little <unk> too .
He comes to a gateway in the brick wall , looks in , and sees a great perplexity of iron lying about in every stage and in a vast variety of shapes — in bars , in <unk> , in sheets ; in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in wheels , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> ; twisted and <unk> into eccentric and <unk> forms as separate parts of <unk> ; mountains of it broken up , and rusty in its age ; distant <unk> of it glowing and <unk> in its youth ; bright <unk> of it <unk> about under the blows of the <unk> ; <unk> iron , <unk> iron , <unk> iron ; an iron taste , an iron smell , and a <unk> of iron sounds .
“ This is a place to make a man ’ s head ache too ! ” says the trooper , looking about him for a <unk> .
“ Who comes here ?
This is very like me before I was set up .
This ought to be my <unk> , if <unk> run in families .
Your servant , sir . ” “ <unk> , sir .
Are you looking for any one ? ” “ Excuse me .
Young Mr. Rouncewell , I believe ? ” “ Yes . ” “ I was looking for your father , sir .
I wish to have a word with him . ” The young man , telling him he is fortunate in his choice of a time , for his father is there , leads the way to the office where he is to be found .
“ Very like me before I was set up — <unk> like me ! ” thinks the trooper as he follows .
They come to a building in the yard with an office on an upper floor .
At sight of the gentleman in the office , Mr. George turns very red .
“ What name shall I say to my father ? ” asks the young man .
George , full of the idea of iron , in <unk> answers “ Steel , ” and is so presented .
He is left alone with the gentleman in the office , who sits at a table with <unk> before him and some sheets of paper blotted with <unk> of figures and <unk> of <unk> shapes .
It is a bare office , with bare windows , looking on the iron view below .
<unk> together on the table are some pieces of iron , purposely broken to be <unk> at various periods of their service , in various <unk> .
There is <unk> on everything ; and the smoke is seen through the windows rolling heavily out of the tall chimneys to <unk> with the smoke from a <unk> <unk> of other chimneys .
“ I am at your service , Mr. Steel , ” says the gentleman when his visitor has taken a rusty chair .
“ Well , Mr. Rouncewell , ” George replies , leaning forward with his left arm on his knee and his hat in his hand , and very <unk> of meeting his brother ’ s eye , “ I am not without my expectations that in the present visit I may prove to be more free than welcome .
I have served as a <unk> in my day , and a comrade of mine that I was once rather partial to was , if I don ’ t deceive myself , a brother of yours .
I believe you had a brother who gave his family some trouble , and ran away , and never did any good but in keeping away ? ” “ Are you quite sure , ” returns the ironmaster in an altered voice , “ that your name is Steel ? ” The trooper falters and looks at him .
His brother starts up , calls him by his name , and <unk> him by both hands .
“ You are too quick for me ! ” cries the trooper with the tears <unk> out of his eyes .
“ How do you do , my dear old fellow ?
I never could have thought you would have been half so glad to see me as all this .
How do you do , my dear old fellow , how do you do ! ” They shake hands and embrace each other over and over again , the trooper still <unk> his “ How do you do , my dear old fellow ! ” with his <unk> that he never thought his brother would have been half so glad to see him as all this !
“ So far from it , ” he declares at the end of a full account of what has preceded his arrival there , “ I had very little idea of making myself known .
I thought if you took by any means <unk> to my name I might gradually get myself up to the point of writing a letter .
But I should not have been surprised , brother , if you had considered it anything but welcome news to hear of me . ” “ We will show you at home what kind of news we think it , George , ” returns his brother .
“ This is a great day at home , and you could not have arrived , you <unk> old soldier , on a better .
I make an agreement with my son Watt to-day that on this day <unk> he shall marry as pretty and as good a girl as you have seen in all your <unk> .
She goes to <unk> to-morrow with one of your <unk> for a little <unk> up in her education .
We make a <unk> of the event , and you will be made the <unk> of it . ” Mr. George is so entirely overcome at first by this prospect that he <unk> the proposed honour with great earnestness .
Being <unk> , however , by his brother and his <unk> — concerning whom he <unk> his <unk> that he never could have thought they would have been half so glad to see him — he is taken home to an elegant house in all the arrangements of which there is to be observed a pleasant mixture of the originally simple habits of the father and mother with such as are suited to their altered station and the higher fortunes of their children .
Here Mr. George is much <unk> by the <unk> and <unk> of his <unk> that are and by the beauty of Rosa , his niece that is to be , and by the affectionate <unk> of these young ladies , which he receives in a sort of dream .
He is <unk> taken <unk> , too , by the dutiful behaviour of his <unk> and has a <unk> consciousness upon him of being a <unk> .
However , there is great <unk> and a very hearty company and infinite enjoyment , and Mr. George comes <unk> and martial through it all , and his <unk> to be present at the marriage and give away the bride is received with <unk> favour .
A <unk> head has Mr. George that night when he lies down in the <unk> of his brother ’ s house to think of all these things and to see the <unk> of his <unk> ( awful all the evening in their <unk> <unk> ) <unk> , after the German manner , over his <unk> .
The brothers are <unk> next morning in the ironmaster ’ s room , where the elder is proceeding , in his clear sensible way , to show how he thinks he may best dispose of George in his business , when George <unk> his hand and stops him .
“ <unk> , I thank you a million times for your more than brotherly welcome , and a million times more to that for your more than brotherly intentions .
But my plans are made .
Before I say a word as to them , I wish to consult you upon one family point .
How , ” says the trooper , folding his arms and looking with <unk> <unk> at his brother , “ how is my mother to be got to scratch me ? ” “ I am not sure that I understand you , George , ” replies the ironmaster .
“ I say , brother , how is my mother to be got to scratch me ?
She must be got to do it somehow . ” “ <unk> you out of her will , I think you mean ? ” “ Of course I do .
In short , ” says the trooper , folding his arms more <unk> yet , “ I mean — TO — scratch me ! ” “ My dear George , ” returns his brother , “ is it so <unk> that you should <unk> that process ? ” “ Quite !
<unk> !
I couldn ’ t be guilty of the meanness of coming back without it .
I should never be safe not to be off again .
I have not <unk> home to <unk> your children , if not yourself , brother , of your rights .
I , who <unk> mine long ago !
If I am to remain and hold up my head , I must be <unk> .
Come .
You are a man of celebrated <unk> and intelligence , and you can tell me how it ’ s to be brought about . ” “ I can tell you , George , ” replies the ironmaster deliberately , “ how it is not to be brought about , which I hope may answer the purpose as well .
Look at our mother , think of her , recall her emotion when she recovered you .
Do you believe there is a consideration in the world that would induce her to take such a step against her favourite son ?
Do you believe there is any chance of her consent , to balance against the <unk> it would be to her ( loving dear old lady ! )
to propose it ?
If you do , you are wrong .
No , George !
You must make up your mind to remain <unk> , I think . ” There is an amused smile on the ironmaster ’ s face as he watches his brother , who is pondering , deeply disappointed .
“ I think you may manage almost as well as if the thing were done , though . ” “ How , brother ? ” “ Being bent upon it , you can dispose by will of anything you have the misfortune to <unk> in any way you like , you know . ” “ That ’ s true ! ” says the trooper , pondering again .
Then he <unk> asks , with his hand on his brother ’ s , “ Would you mind mentioning that , brother , to your wife and family ? ” “ Not at all . ” “ Thank you .
You wouldn ’ t object to say , perhaps , that although an <unk> vagabond , I am a vagabond of the <unk> order , and not of the mean sort ? ” The ironmaster , <unk> his amused smile , <unk> .
“ Thank you .
Thank you .
It ’ s a weight off my mind , ” says the trooper with a <unk> of his chest as he <unk> his arms and puts a hand on each leg , “ though I had set my heart on being <unk> , too ! ” The brothers are very like each other , sitting face to face ; but a certain massive simplicity and absence of <unk> in the ways of the world is all on the trooper ’ s side .
“ Well , ” he proceeds , throwing off his disappointment , “ next and last , those plans of mine .
You have been so brotherly as to propose to me to fall in here and take my place among the <unk> of your perseverance and sense .
I thank you heartily .
It ’ s more than brotherly , as I said before , and I thank you heartily for it , ” shaking him a long time by the hand .
“ But the truth is , brother , I am a — I am a kind of a <unk> , and it ’ s too late to <unk> me in a regular garden . ” “ My dear George , ” returns the elder , <unk> his strong steady brow upon him and smiling confidently , “ leave that to me , and let me try . ” George shakes his head .
“ You could do it , I have not a doubt , if anybody could ; but it ’ s not to be done .
Not to be done , sir !
Whereas it so falls out , on the other hand , that I am able to be of some trifle of use to Sir Leicester Dedlock since his illness — brought on by family <unk> — and that he would rather have that help from our mother ’ s son than from anybody else . ” “ Well , my dear George , ” returns the other with a very slight shade upon his open face , “ if you prefer to serve in Sir Leicester Dedlock ’ s household <unk> — ” “ There it is , brother , ” cries the trooper , <unk> him , with his hand upon his knee again ; “ there it is !
You don ’ t take kindly to that idea ; I don ’ t mind it .
You are not used to being <unk> ; I am .
Everything about you is in perfect order and discipline ; everything about me requires to be kept so .
We are not accustomed to carry things with the same hand or to look at ’ em from the same point .
I don ’ t say much about my <unk> manners because I found myself pretty well at my ease last night , and they wouldn ’ t be noticed here , I dare say , once and away .
But I shall get on best at Chesney Wold , where there ’ s more room for a <unk> than there is here ; and the dear old lady will be made happy besides .
Therefore I accept of Sir Leicester Dedlock ’ s proposals .
When I come over next year to give away the bride , or whenever I come , I shall have the sense to keep the household <unk> in <unk> and not to <unk> it on your ground .
I thank you heartily again and am proud to think of the <unk> as they ’ ll be founded by you . ” “ You know yourself , George , ” says the elder brother , returning the <unk> of his hand , “ and perhaps you know me better than I know myself .
Take your way .
So that we don ’ t quite lose one another again , take your way . ” “ No fear of that ! ” returns the trooper .
“ Now , before I turn my horse ’ s head <unk> , brother , I will ask you — if you ’ ll be so good — to look over a letter for me .
I brought it with me to send from these parts , as Chesney Wold might be a painful name just now to the person it ’ s written to .
I am not much accustomed to correspondence myself , and I am particular respecting this present letter because I want it to be both <unk> and delicate . ” <unk> he hands a letter , closely written in somewhat pale ink but in a neat round hand , to the ironmaster , who reads as follows : Miss Esther Summerson , A communication having been made to me by Inspector Bucket of a letter to myself being found among the papers of a certain person , I take the liberty to make known to you that it was but a few lines of <unk> from abroad , when , where , and how to deliver an enclosed letter to a young and beautiful lady , then <unk> , in England .
I <unk> observed the same .
I further take the liberty to make known to you that it was got from me as a proof of handwriting only and that otherwise I would not have given it up , as appearing to be the most harmless in my possession , without being previously shot through the heart .
I further take the liberty to mention that if I could have supposed a certain unfortunate gentleman to have been in existence , I never could and never would have rested until I had discovered his retreat and <unk> my last <unk> with him , as my duty and my inclination would have equally been .
But he was ( <unk> ) reported <unk> , and assuredly went over the side of a <unk> at night in an <unk> <unk> within a few hours of her arrival from the <unk> <unk> , as I have myself heard both from officers and men on board , and know to have been ( <unk> ) confirmed .
I further take the liberty to state that in my humble quality as one of the <unk> and file , I am , and shall ever continue to be , your thoroughly devoted and admiring servant and that I esteem the qualities you possess above all others far beyond the limits of the present dispatch .
I have the honour to be , <unk> “ A little formal , ” observes the elder brother , <unk> it with a <unk> face .
“ But nothing that might not be sent to a pattern young lady ? ” asks the younger .
“ Nothing at all . ” Therefore it is <unk> and deposited for <unk> among the iron correspondence of the day .
This done , Mr. George takes a hearty farewell of the family party and prepares to <unk> and mount .
His brother , however , unwilling to part with him so soon , proposes to ride with him in a light open carriage to the place where he will <unk> for the night , and there remain with him until morning , a servant riding for so much of the journey on the <unk> old grey from Chesney Wold .
The offer , being <unk> accepted , is followed by a pleasant ride , a pleasant dinner , and a pleasant breakfast , all in brotherly <unk> .
Then they once more shake hands long and heartily and part , the ironmaster turning his face to the smoke and fires , and the trooper to the green country .
<unk> in the afternoon the subdued sound of his heavy military <unk> is heard on the turf in the avenue as he <unk> on with imaginary <unk> and <unk> of <unk> under the old <unk> .
CHAPTER <unk> Esther ’ s Narrative <unk> after I had that conversation with my guardian , he put a <unk> paper in my hand one morning and said , “ This is for next month , my dear . ” I found in it two hundred pounds .
I now began very quietly to make such preparations as I thought were necessary .
<unk> my <unk> by my guardian ’ s taste , which I knew very well of course , I arranged my <unk> to please him and hoped I should be highly <unk> .
I did it all so quietly because I was not quite free from my old apprehension that Ada would be rather sorry and because my guardian was so quiet himself .
I had no doubt that under all the circumstances we should be married in the most private and simple manner .
Perhaps I should only have to say to Ada , “ Would you like to come and see me married to-morrow , my pet ? ” Perhaps our <unk> might even be as <unk> as her own , and I might not find it necessary to say anything about it until it was over .
I thought that if I were to choose , I would like this best .
The only <unk> I made was Mrs. Woodcourt .
I told her that I was going to be married to my guardian and that we had been engaged some time .
She highly <unk> .
She could never do enough for me and was remarkably softened now in comparison with what she had been when we first knew her .
There was no trouble she would not have taken to have been of use to me , but I need hardly say that I only allowed her to take as little as gratified her kindness without <unk> it .
Of course this was not a time to <unk> my guardian , and of course it was not a time for <unk> my darling .
So I had plenty of occupation , which I was glad of ; and as to Charley , she was absolutely not to be seen for needlework .
To <unk> herself with great heaps of it — <unk> full and tables full — and do a little , and spend a great deal of time in staring with her round eyes at what there was to do , and persuade herself that she was going to do it , were Charley ’ s great <unk> and <unk> .
Meanwhile , I must say , I could not agree with my guardian on the subject of the will , and I had some sanguine hopes of Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
Which of us was right will soon appear , but I certainly did encourage expectations .
In Richard , the discovery gave occasion for a burst of business and agitation that <unk> him up for a little time , but he had lost the <unk> even of hope now and seemed to me to retain only its <unk> <unk> .
From something my guardian said one day when we were talking about this , I understood that my marriage would not take place until after the <unk> we had been told to look forward to ; and I thought the more , for that , how rejoiced I should be if I could be married when Richard and Ada were a little more prosperous .
The term was very near indeed when my guardian was called out of town and went down into <unk> on Mr. Woodcourt ’ s business .
He had told me beforehand that his presence there would be necessary .
I had just come in one night from my dear girl ’ s and was sitting in the midst of all my new clothes , looking at them all around me and thinking , when a letter from my guardian was brought to me .
It asked me to join him in the country and mentioned by what <unk> my place was taken and at what time in the morning I should have to leave town .
It added in a <unk> that I would not be many hours from Ada .
I expected few things less than a journey at that time , but I was ready for it in half an hour and set off as appointed early next morning .
I <unk> all day , wondering all day what I could be wanted for at such a distance ; now I thought it might be for this purpose , and now I thought it might be for that purpose , but I was never , never , never near the truth .
It was night when I came to my journey ’ s end and found my guardian waiting for me .
This was a great relief , for towards evening I had begun to fear ( the more so as his letter was a very short one ) that he might be ill .
However , there he was , as well as it was possible to be ; and when I saw his genial face again at its brightest and best , I said to myself , he has been doing some other great kindness .
Not that it required much <unk> to say that , because I knew that his being there at all was an act of kindness .
<unk> was ready at the hotel , and when we were alone at table he said , “ <unk> of curiosity , no doubt , little woman , to know why I have brought you here ? ” “ Well , guardian , ” said I , “ without thinking myself a <unk> or you a <unk> <unk> , I am a little curious about it . ” “ Then to <unk> your night ’ s rest , my love , ” he returned gaily , “ I won ’ t wait until to-morrow to tell you .
I have very much wished to express to Woodcourt , somehow , my sense of his humanity to poor unfortunate Jo , his <unk> services to my young cousins , and his value to us all .
When it was decided that he should settle here , it came into my head that I might ask his acceptance of some <unk> and suitable little place to lay his own head in .
I therefore caused such a place to be looked out for , and such a place was found on very easy terms , and I have been touching it up for him and making it <unk> .
However , when I walked over it the day before yesterday and it was reported ready , I found that I was not housekeeper enough to know whether things were all as they ought to be .
So I sent off for the best little housekeeper that could possibly be got to come and give me her advice and opinion .
And here she is , ” said my guardian , “ laughing and crying both together ! ” Because he was so dear , so good , so <unk> .
I tried to tell him what I thought of him , but I could not <unk> a word .
“ <unk> , <unk> ! ” said my guardian .
“ You make too much of it , little woman .
Why , how you sob , Dame Durden , how you sob ! ” “ It is with <unk> pleasure , guardian — with a heart full of thanks . ” “ Well , well , ” said he .
“ I am delighted that you approve .
I thought you would .
I meant it as a pleasant surprise for the little mistress of Bleak House . ” I kissed him and dried my eyes .
“ I know now ! ” said I.
“ I have seen this in your face a long while . ” “ No ; have you really , my dear ? ” said he .
“ What a Dame Durden it is to read a face ! ” He was so <unk> cheerful that I could not long be otherwise , and was almost ashamed of having been otherwise at all .
When I went to bed , I cried .
I am bound to confess that I cried ; but I hope it was with pleasure , though I am not quite sure it was with pleasure .
I repeated every word of the letter twice over .
A most beautiful summer morning succeeded , and after breakfast we went out arm in arm to see the house of which I was to give my mighty housekeeping opinion .
We entered a flower-garden by a gate in a side wall , of which he had the key , and the first thing I saw was that the beds and flowers were all laid out according to the manner of my beds and flowers at home .
“ You see , my dear , ” observed my guardian , standing still with a delighted face to watch my looks , “ knowing there could be no better plan , I borrowed yours . ” We went on by a pretty little <unk> , where the <unk> were <unk> among the green leaves and the shadows of the <unk> were <unk> on the grass , to the house itself — a cottage , quite a rustic cottage of doll ’ s rooms ; but such a lovely place , so tranquil and so beautiful , with such a rich and smiling country spread around it ; with water sparkling away into the distance , here all <unk> with <unk> , there turning a <unk> mill ; at its nearest point glancing through a <unk> by the cheerful town , where <unk> were <unk> in bright groups and a <unk> was flying from a white <unk> that <unk> in the sweet west wind .
And still , as we went through the pretty rooms , out at the little rustic <unk> doors , and underneath the tiny wooden <unk> <unk> with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , I saw in the <unk> on the walls , in the colours of the furniture , in the arrangement of all the pretty objects , MY little tastes and <unk> , MY little <unk> and <unk> which they used to laugh at while they praised them , my odd ways everywhere .
I could not say enough in admiration of what was all so beautiful , but one secret doubt arose in my mind when I saw this , I thought , oh , would he be the happier for it !
Would it not have been better for his peace that I should not have been so brought before him ?
Because although I was not what he thought me , still he loved me very dearly , and it might remind him <unk> of what be believed he had lost .
I did not wish him to forget me — perhaps he might not have done so , without these <unk> to his memory — but my way was easier than his , and I could have <unk> myself even to that so that he had been the happier for it .
“ And now , little woman , ” said my guardian , whom I had never seen so proud and joyful as in showing me these things and watching my appreciation of them , “ now , last of all , for the name of this house . ” “ What is it called , dear guardian ? ” “ My child , ” said he , “ come and see , ” He took me to the porch , which he had <unk> <unk> , and said , pausing before we went out , “ My dear child , don ’ t you guess the name ? ” “ No ! ” said I.
We went out of the porch and he showed me written over it , Bleak House .
He led me to a seat among the leaves close by , and sitting down beside me and taking my hand in his , spoke to me thus , “ My darling girl , in what there has been between us , I have , I hope , been really <unk> for your happiness .
When I wrote you the letter to which you brought the answer , ” smiling as he referred to it , “ I had my own too much in view ; but I had yours too .
Whether , under different circumstances , I might ever have renewed the old dream I sometimes dreamed when you were very young , of making you my wife one day , I need not ask myself .
I did renew it , and I wrote my letter , and you brought your answer .
You are following what I say , my child ? ” I was cold , and I trembled violently , but not a word he uttered was lost .
As I sat looking fixedly at him and the sun ’ s <unk> <unk> , softly shining through the leaves upon his bare head , I felt as if the brightness on him must be like the brightness of the angels .
“ <unk> me , my love , but do not speak .
It is for me to speak now .
When it was that I began to doubt whether what I had done would really make you happy is no matter .
Woodcourt came home , and I soon had no doubt at all . ” I clasped him round the neck and hung my head upon his breast and wept .
“ Lie lightly , confidently here , my child , ” said he , pressing me gently to him .
“ I am your guardian and your father now .
<unk> confidently here . ” <unk> , like the gentle rustling of the leaves ; and <unk> , like the <unk> weather ; and <unk> and <unk> , like the sunshine , he went on .
“ <unk> me , my dear girl .
I had no doubt of your being contented and happy with me , being so dutiful and so devoted ; but I saw with whom you would be happier .
That I <unk> his secret when Dame Durden was blind to it is no wonder , for I knew the good that could never change in her better far than she did .
Well !
I have long been in Allan Woodcourt ’ s confidence , although he was not , until yesterday , a few hours before you came here , in mine .
But I would not have my Esther ’ s bright example lost ; I would not have a <unk> of my dear girl ’ s virtues <unk> and <unk> ; I would not have her admitted on <unk> into the line of Morgan ap-Kerrig , no , not for the weight in gold of all the mountains in <unk> ! ” He stopped to kiss me on the forehead , and I sobbed and wept afresh .
For I felt as if I could not bear the painful delight of his praise .
“ Hush , little woman !
Don ’ t cry ; this is to be a day of joy .
I have looked forward to it , ” he said <unk> , “ for months on months !
A few words more , Dame Trot , and I have said my say .
<unk> not to throw away one <unk> of my Esther ’ s worth , I took Mrs. Woodcourt into a separate confidence .
‘ Now , <unk> , ’ said I , ‘ I clearly perceive — and indeed I know , to <unk> — that your son loves my ward .
I am further very sure that my ward loves your son , but will sacrifice her love to a sense of duty and affection , and will sacrifice it so completely , so entirely , so <unk> , that you should never suspect it though you watched her night and day . ’ Then I told her all our story — ours — yours and mine .
‘ Now , <unk> , ’ said I , ‘ come you , knowing this , and live with us .
Come you , and see my child from hour to hour ; set what you see against her <unk> , which is this , and this ’ — for I <unk> to <unk> it — ‘ and tell me what is the true <unk> when you shall have quite made up your mind on that subject . ’ Why , honour to her old <unk> blood , my dear , ” cried my guardian with enthusiasm , “ I believe the heart it <unk> beats no less <unk> , no less <unk> , no less <unk> , towards Dame Durden than my own ! ” He tenderly raised my head , and as I clung to him , kissed me in his old fatherly way again and again .
What a light , now , on the <unk> manner I had thought about !
“ One more last word .
When Allan Woodcourt spoke to you , my dear , he spoke with my knowledge and consent — but I gave him no encouragement , not I , for these <unk> were my great reward , and I was too <unk> to part with a scrap of it .
He was to come and tell me all that passed , and he did .
I have no more to say .
My dearest , Allan Woodcourt stood beside your father when he lay dead — stood beside your mother .
This is Bleak House .
This day I give this house its little mistress ; and before God , it is the brightest day in all my life ! ” He rose and raised me with him .
We were no longer alone .
My husband — I have called him by that name full seven happy years now — stood at my side .
“ Allan , ” said my guardian , “ take from me a willing <unk> , the best wife that ever man had .
What more can I say for you than that I know you <unk> her !
Take with her the little home she brings you .
You know what she will make it , Allan ; you know what she has made its <unk> .
Let me share its <unk> sometimes , and what do I sacrifice ?
Nothing , nothing . ” He kissed me once again , and now the tears were in his eyes as he said more softly , “ Esther , my dearest , after so many years , there is a kind of parting in this too .
I know that my mistake has caused you some distress .
<unk> your old guardian , in <unk> him to his old place in your <unk> ; and <unk> it out of your memory .
Allan , take my dear . ” He moved away from under the green roof of leaves , and stopping in the sunlight outside and turning cheerfully towards us , said , “ I shall be found about here somewhere .
It ’ s a west wind , little woman , due west !
Let no one thank me any more , for I am going to <unk> to my <unk> habits , and if anybody <unk> this warning , I ’ ll run away and never come back ! ” What happiness was ours that day , what joy , what rest , what hope , what gratitude , what <unk> !
We were to be married before the month was out , but when we were to come and take possession of our own house was to depend on Richard and Ada .
We all three went home together next day .
As soon as we arrived in town , Allan went straight to see Richard and to carry our joyful news to him and my darling .
<unk> as it was , I meant to go to her for a few minutes before lying down to sleep , but I went home with my guardian first to make his tea for him and to occupy the old chair by his side , for I did not like to think of its being empty so soon .
When we came home we found that a young man had called three times in the course of that one day to see me and that having been told on the occasion of his third call that I was not expected to return before ten o ’ clock at night , he had left word that he would call about then .
He had left his card three times .
Mr. Guppy .
As I naturally <unk> on the object of these visits , and as I always associated something <unk> with the visitor , it fell out that in laughing about Mr. Guppy I told my guardian of his old proposal and his <unk> <unk> .
“ After that , ” said my guardian , “ we will certainly receive this <unk> . ” So instructions were given that Mr. Guppy should be shown in when he came again , and they were scarcely given when he did come again .
He was embarrassed when he found my guardian with me , but recovered himself and said , “ How de do , sir ? ” “ How do you do , sir ? ” returned my guardian .
“ Thank you , sir , I am <unk> , ” returned Mr. Guppy .
“ Will you allow me to <unk> my mother , Mrs. Guppy of the Old Street Road , and my particular friend , Mr. Weevle .
That is to say , my friend has gone by the name of Weevle , but his name is really and truly Jobling . ” My guardian begged them to be seated , and they all sat down .
“ Tony , ” said Mr. Guppy to his friend after an awkward silence .
“ Will you open the case ? ” “ Do it yourself , ” returned the friend rather <unk> .
“ Well , Mr. Jarndyce , sir , ” Mr. Guppy , after a moment ’ s consideration , began , to the great <unk> of his mother , which she <unk> by <unk> Mr. Jobling with her elbow and winking at me in a most remarkable manner , “ I had an idea that I should see Miss Summerson by herself and was not quite prepared for your esteemed presence .
But Miss Summerson has mentioned to you , perhaps , that something has passed between us on former occasions ? ” “ Miss Summerson , ” returned my guardian , smiling , “ has made a communication to that effect to me . ” “ That , ” said Mr. Guppy , “ makes matters easier .
Sir , I have come out of my articles at Kenge and Carboy ’ s , and I believe with satisfaction to all parties .
I am now admitted ( after <unk> an examination that ’ s enough to <unk> a man blue , touching a <unk> of nonsense that he don ’ t want to know ) on the roll of <unk> and have taken out my <unk> , if it would be any satisfaction to you to see it . ” “ Thank you , Mr. Guppy , ” returned my guardian .
“ I am quite willing — I believe I use a legal phrase — to admit the <unk> . ” Mr. Guppy therefore <unk> from taking something out of his pocket and proceeded without it .
“ I have no capital myself , but my mother has a little property which takes the form of an <unk> ” — here Mr. Guppy ’ s mother rolled her head as if she never could sufficiently enjoy the observation , and put her handkerchief to her mouth , and again <unk> at me — “ and a few pounds for expenses out of pocket in conducting business will never be wanting , free of interest , which is an advantage , you know , ” said Mr. Guppy feelingly .
“ Certainly an advantage , ” returned my guardian .
“ I HAVE some connexion , ” pursued Mr. Guppy , “ and it lays in the direction of <unk> Square , <unk> .
I have therefore taken a ’ ouse in that <unk> , which , in the opinion of my friends , is a hollow bargain ( <unk> ridiculous , and use of <unk> included in the rent ) , and intend setting up professionally for myself there <unk> . ” Here Mr. Guppy ’ s mother fell into an extraordinary passion of rolling her head and smiling <unk> at anybody who would look at her .
“ It ’ s a <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , ” said Mr. Guppy , “ and in the opinion of my friends , a <unk> <unk> .
When I mention my friends , I refer principally to my friend Jobling , who I believe has known me , ” Mr. Guppy looked at him with a <unk> air , “ from <unk> ’ s hour . ” Mr. Jobling confirmed this with a sliding movement of his legs .
“ My friend Jobling will render me his assistance in the capacity of clerk and will live in the ’ ouse , ” said Mr. Guppy .
“ My mother will likewise live in the ’ ouse when her present quarter in the Old Street Road shall have ceased and <unk> ; and consequently there will be no want of society .
My friend Jobling is naturally aristocratic by taste , and besides being acquainted with the movements of the upper circles , fully backs me in the intentions I am now <unk> . ” Mr. Jobling said “ Certainly ” and withdrew a little from the elbow of Mr Guppy ’ s mother .
“ Now , I have no occasion to mention to you , sir , you being in the confidence of Miss Summerson , ” said Mr. Guppy , “ ( mother , I wish you ’ d be so good as to keep still ) , that Miss Summerson ’ s image was formerly imprinted on my ’ eart and that I made her a proposal of marriage . ” “ That I have heard , ” returned my guardian .
“ <unk> , ” pursued Mr. Guppy , “ over which I had no control , but quite the contrary , <unk> the impression of that image for a time .
At which time Miss Summerson ’ s conduct was highly genteel ; I may even add , <unk> . ” My guardian patted me on the shoulder and seemed much amused .
“ Now , sir , ” said Mr. Guppy , “ I have got into that state of mind myself that I wish for a <unk> of <unk> behaviour .
I wish to prove to Miss Summerson that I can rise to a <unk> of which perhaps she hardly thought me capable .
I find that the image which I did suppose had been <unk> from my ’ eart is NOT <unk> .
Its influence over me is still <unk> , and yielding to it , I am willing to <unk> the circumstances over which none of us have had any control and to renew those proposals to Miss Summerson which I had the honour to make at a former period .
I beg to lay the ’ ouse in <unk> Square , the business , and myself before Miss Summerson for her acceptance . ” “ Very <unk> indeed , sir , ” observed my guardian .
“ Well , sir , ” replied Mr. Guppy with candour , “ my wish is to BE <unk> .
I do not consider that in making this offer to Miss Summerson I am by any means throwing myself away ; neither is that the opinion of my friends .
Still , there are circumstances which I submit may be taken into account as a set off against any little <unk> of mine , and so a fair and <unk> balance arrived at . ” “ I take upon myself , sir , ” said my guardian , laughing as he rang the bell , “ to reply to your proposals on behalf of Miss Summerson .
She is very sensible of your handsome intentions , and wishes you good evening , and wishes you well . ” “ Oh ! ” said Mr. Guppy with a blank look .
“ Is that <unk> , sir , to acceptance , or <unk> , or consideration ? ” “ To decided <unk> , if you please , ” returned my guardian .
Mr. Guppy looked <unk> at his friend , and at his mother , who suddenly turned very angry , and at the floor , and at the ceiling .
“ Indeed ? ” said he .
“ Then , Jobling , if you was the friend you represent yourself , I should think you might hand my mother out of the <unk> instead of <unk> her to remain where she ain ’ t wanted . ” But Mrs. Guppy positively refused to come out of the <unk> .
She wouldn ’ t hear of it .
“ Why , get along with you , ” said she to my guardian , “ what do you mean ?
Ain ’ t my son good enough for you ?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself .
Get out with you ! ” “ My good lady , ” returned my guardian , “ it is hardly reasonable to ask me to get out of my own room . ” “ I don ’ t care for that , ” said Mrs. Guppy .
“ Get out with you .
If we ain ’ t good enough for you , go and <unk> somebody that is good enough .
Go along and find ’ em . ” I was quite unprepared for the rapid manner in which Mrs. Guppy ’ s power of <unk> <unk> into a power of taking the <unk> offence .
“ Go along and find somebody that ’ s good enough for you , ” repeated Mrs. Guppy .
“ Get out ! ” Nothing seemed to <unk> Mr. Guppy ’ s mother so much and to make her so very indignant as our not getting out .
“ Why don ’ t you get out ? ” said Mrs. Guppy .
“ What are you stopping here for ? ” “ Mother , ” interposed her son , always getting before her and pushing her back with one shoulder as she <unk> at my guardian , “ WILL you hold your tongue ? ” “ No , William , ” she returned , “ I won ’ t !
Not unless he gets out , I won ’ t ! ” However , Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling together closed on Mr. Guppy ’ s mother ( who began to be quite <unk> ) and took her , very much against her will , downstairs , her voice rising a <unk> higher every time her figure got a <unk> lower , and <unk> that we should immediately go and find somebody who was good enough for us , and above all things that we should get out .
CHAPTER <unk> <unk> the <unk> The term had commenced , and my guardian found an <unk> from Mr. Kenge that the cause would come on in two days .
As I had sufficient hopes of the will to be in a <unk> about it , Allan and I agreed to go down to the court that morning .
Richard was extremely <unk> and was so weak and low , though his illness was still of the mind , that my dear girl indeed had <unk> occasion to be supported .
But she looked forward — a very little way now — to the help that was to come to her , and never <unk> .
It was at Westminster that the cause was to come on .
It had come on there , I dare say , a hundred times before , but I could not <unk> myself of an idea that it <unk> lead to some result now .
We left home directly after breakfast to be at Westminster Hall in good time and walked down there through the lively streets — so happily and strangely it seemed ! — together .
As we were going along , <unk> what we should do for Richard and Ada , I heard somebody calling “ Esther !
My dear Esther !
Esther ! ” And there was Caddy Jellyby , with her head out of the window of a little carriage which she <unk> now to go about in to her pupils ( she had so many ) , as if she wanted to embrace me at a hundred yards ’ distance .
I had written her a note to tell her of all that my guardian had done , but had not had a moment to go and see her .
Of course we turned back , and the affectionate girl was in that state of rapture , and was so <unk> to talk about the night when she brought me the flowers , and was so determined to <unk> my face ( bonnet and all ) between her hands , and go on in a wild manner altogether , calling me all kinds of precious names , and telling Allan I had done I don ’ t know what for her , that I was just obliged to get into the little carriage and calm her down by letting her say and do exactly what she liked .
Allan , standing at the window , was as pleased as Caddy ; and I was as pleased as either of them ; and I wonder that I got away as I did , rather than that I came off laughing , and red , and anything but tidy , and looking after Caddy , who looked after us out of the <unk> as long as she could see us .
This made us some quarter of an hour late , and when we came to Westminster Hall we found that the day ’ s business was begun .
<unk> than that , we found such an unusual crowd in the Court of Chancery that it was full to the door , and we could neither see nor hear what was passing within .
It appeared to be something droll , for occasionally there was a laugh and a cry of “ <unk> ! ” It appeared to be something interesting , for every one was pushing and striving to get nearer .
It appeared to be something that made the professional gentlemen very merry , for there were several young <unk> in wigs and whiskers on the outside of the crowd , and when one of them told the others about it , they put their hands in their pockets , and quite <unk> themselves up with laughter , and went <unk> about the pavement of the Hall .
We asked a gentleman by us if he knew what cause was on .
He told us Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
We asked him if he knew what was doing in it .
He said really , no he did not , nobody ever did , but as well as he could make out , it was over .
Over for the day ?
we asked him .
No , he said , over for good .
Over for good !
When we heard this unaccountable answer , we looked at one another quite lost in amazement .
Could it be possible that the will had set things right at last and that Richard and Ada were going to be rich ?
It seemed too good to be true .
<unk> it was !
Our suspense was short , for a <unk> soon took place in the crowd , and the people came <unk> out looking flushed and hot and bringing a quantity of bad air with them .
Still they were all exceedingly amused and were more like people coming out from a <unk> or a <unk> than from a court of justice .
We stood aside , watching for any countenance we knew , and presently great bundles of paper began to be carried out — bundles in bags , bundles too large to be got into any bags , immense <unk> of papers of all shapes and no shapes , which the bearers <unk> under , and threw down for the time being , <unk> , on the Hall pavement , while they went back to bring out more .
Even these clerks were laughing .
We glanced at the papers , and seeing Jarndyce and Jarndyce everywhere , asked an <unk> person who was standing in the midst of them whether the cause was over .
Yes , he said , it was all up with it at last , and burst out laughing too .
At this <unk> we perceived Mr. Kenge coming out of court with an affable dignity upon him , listening to Mr. Vholes , who was deferential and carried his own bag .
Mr. Vholes was the first to see us .
“ Here is Miss Summerson , sir , ” he said .
“ And Mr. Woodcourt . ” “ Oh , indeed !
Yes .
Truly ! ” said Mr. Kenge , raising his hat to me with <unk> politeness .
“ How do you do ?
Glad to see you .
Mr. Jarndyce is not here ? ” No .
He never came there , I reminded him .
“ Really , ” returned Mr. Kenge , “ it is as well that he is NOT here to-day , for his — shall I say , in my good friend ’ s absence , his <unk> <unk> of opinion ? — might have been strengthened , perhaps ; not <unk> , but might have been strengthened . ” “ Pray what has been done to-day ? ” asked Allan .
“ I beg your pardon ? ” said Mr. Kenge with <unk> <unk> .
“ What has been done to-day ? ” “ What has been done , ” repeated Mr. Kenge .
“ Quite so .
Yes .
Why , not much has been done ; not much .
We have been checked — brought up suddenly , I would say — upon the — shall I term it threshold ? ” “ Is this will considered a genuine document , sir ? ” said Allan .
“ Will you tell us that ? ” “ Most certainly , if I could , ” said Mr. Kenge ; “ but we have not gone into that , we have not gone into that . ” “ We have not gone into that , ” repeated Mr. Vholes as if his low inward voice were an echo .
“ You are to reflect , Mr. Woodcourt , ” observed Mr. Kenge , using his silver <unk> <unk> and <unk> , “ that this has been a great cause , that this has been a <unk> cause , that this has been a <unk> cause .
Jarndyce and Jarndyce has been <unk> , not <unk> , a monument of Chancery practice . ” “ And patience has sat upon it a long time , ” said Allan .
“ Very well indeed , sir , ” returned Mr. Kenge with a certain condescending laugh he had .
“ Very well !
You are further to reflect , Mr. Woodcourt , ” becoming dignified almost to severity , “ that on the numerous difficulties , <unk> , masterly <unk> , and forms of <unk> in this great cause , there has been <unk> study , <unk> , eloquence , knowledge , <unk> , Mr. Woodcourt , high <unk> .
For many years , the — a — I would say the flower of the bar , and the — a — I would presume to add , the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> — have been <unk> upon Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
If the public have the <unk> , and if the country have the <unk> , of this great <unk> , it must be paid for in money or money ’ s worth , sir . ” “ Mr.
Kenge , ” said Allan , appearing <unk> all in a moment .
“ Excuse me , our time <unk> .
Do I understand that the whole estate is found to have been absorbed in costs ? ” “ Hem !
I believe so , ” returned Mr. Kenge .
“ Mr.
Vholes , what do YOU say ? ” “ I believe so , ” said Mr. Vholes .
“ And that thus the suit <unk> and <unk> away ? ” “ Probably , ” returned Mr. Kenge .
“ Mr.
Vholes ? ” “ Probably , ” said Mr. Vholes .
“ My dearest life , ” whispered Allan , “ this will break Richard ’ s heart ! ” There was such a shock of apprehension in his face , and he knew Richard so perfectly , and I too had seen so much of his <unk> <unk> , that what my dear girl had said to me in the fullness of her <unk> love sounded like a <unk> in my ears .
“ In case you should be wanting Mr. C. , sir , ” said Mr. Vholes , coming after us , “ you ’ ll find him in court .
I left him there resting himself a little .
Good day , sir ; good day , Miss Summerson . ” As he gave me that slowly <unk> look of his , while <unk> up the strings of his bag before he <unk> with it after Mr. Kenge , the benignant shadow of whose <unk> presence he seemed afraid to leave , he gave one gasp as if he had swallowed the last morsel of his client , and his black <unk> unwholesome figure <unk> away to the low door at the end of the Hall .
“ My dear love , ” said Allan , “ leave to me , for a little while , the charge you gave me .
Go home with this intelligence and come to Ada ’ s by and by ! ” I would not let him take me to a coach , but entreated him to go to Richard without a moment ’ s delay and leave me to do as he wished .
<unk> home , I found my guardian and told him gradually with what news I had returned .
“ Little woman , ” said he , quite unmoved for himself , “ to have done with the suit on any terms is a greater blessing than I had looked for .
But my poor young cousins ! ” We talked about them all the morning and discussed what it was possible to do .
In the afternoon my guardian walked with me to Symond ’ s Inn and left me at the door .
I went upstairs .
When my darling heard my footsteps , she came out into the small passage and threw her arms round my neck , but she composed herself directly and said that Richard had asked for me several times .
Allan had found him sitting in the corner of the court , she told me , like a stone figure .
On being <unk> , he had broken away and made as if he would have spoken in a fierce voice to the judge .
He was stopped by his mouth being full of blood , and Allan had brought him home .
He was lying on a sofa with his eyes closed when I went in .
There were <unk> on the table ; the room was made as airy as possible , and was darkened , and was very orderly and quiet .
Allan stood behind him watching him gravely .
His face appeared to me to be quite <unk> of colour , and now that I saw him without his seeing me , I fully saw , for the first time , how worn away he was .
But he looked <unk> than I had seen him look for many a day .
I sat down by his side in silence .
<unk> his eyes by and by , he said in a weak voice , but with his old smile , “ Dame Durden , kiss me , my dear ! ” It was a great comfort and surprise to me to find him in his low state cheerful and looking forward .
He was happier , he said , in our intended marriage than he could find words to tell me .
My husband had been a guardian angel to him and Ada , and he blessed us both and wished us all the joy that life could yield us .
I almost felt as if my own heart would have broken when I saw him take my husband ’ s hand and hold it to his breast .
We spoke of the future as much as possible , and he said several times that he must be present at our marriage if he could stand upon his feet .
Ada would <unk> to take him , somehow , he said .
“ Yes , surely , dearest Richard ! ” But as my darling answered him thus hopefully , so serene and beautiful , with the help that was to come to her so near — I knew — I knew !
It was not good for him to talk too much , and when he was silent , we were silent too .
<unk> beside him , I made a pretence of working for my dear , as he had always been used to joke about my being busy .
Ada leaned upon his pillow , holding his head upon her arm .
He <unk> often , and whenever he awoke without seeing him , said first of all , “ Where is Woodcourt ? ” <unk> had come on when I lifted up my eyes and saw my guardian standing in the little hall .
“ Who is that , Dame Durden ? ” Richard asked me .
The door was behind him , but he had observed in my face that some one was there .
I looked to Allan for advice , and as he nodded “ Yes , ” bent over Richard and told him .
My guardian saw what passed , came softly by me in a moment , and laid his hand on Richard ’ s .
“ Oh , sir , ” said Richard , “ you are a good man , you are a good man ! ” and burst into tears for the first time .
My guardian , the picture of a good man , sat down in my place , keeping his hand on Richard ’ s .
“ My dear Rick , ” said he , “ the clouds have cleared away , and it is bright now .
We can see now .
We were all <unk> , Rick , more or less .
What matters !
And how are you , my dear boy ? ” “ I am very weak , sir , but I hope I shall be stronger .
I have to begin the world . ” “ Aye , truly ; well said ! ” cried my guardian .
“ I will not begin it in the old way now , ” said Richard with a sad smile .
“ I have learned a lesson now , sir .
It was a hard one , but you shall be assured , indeed , that I have learned it . ” “ Well , well , ” said my guardian , <unk> him ; “ well , well , well , dear boy ! ” “ I was thinking , sir , ” resumed Richard , “ that there is nothing on earth I should so much like to see as their house — Dame Durden ’ s and Woodcourt ’ s house .
If I could be removed there when I begin to recover my strength , I feel as if I should get well there sooner than anywhere . ” “ Why , so have I been thinking too , Rick , ” said my guardian , “ and our little woman likewise ; she and I have been talking of it this very day .
I dare say her husband won ’ t object .
What do you think ? ” Richard smiled and lifted up his arm to touch him as he stood behind the head of the couch .
“ I say nothing of Ada , ” said Richard , “ but I think of her , and have thought of her very much .
Look at her !
See her here , sir , bending over this pillow when she has so much need to rest upon it herself , my dear love , my poor girl ! ” He clasped her in his arms , and none of us spoke .
He gradually released her , and she looked upon us , and looked up to heaven , and moved her lips .
“ When I get down to Bleak House , ” said Richard , “ I shall have much to tell you , sir , and you will have much to show me .
You will go , won ’ t you ? ” “ <unk> , dear Rick . ” “ Thank you ; like you , like you , ” said Richard .
“ But it ’ s all like you .
They have been telling me how you <unk> it and how you remembered all Esther ’ s familiar tastes and ways .
It will be like coming to the old Bleak House again . ” “ And you will come there too , I hope , Rick .
I am a solitary man now , you know , and it will be a charity to come to me .
A charity to come to me , my love ! ” he repeated to Ada as he gently passed his hand over her golden hair and put a lock of it to his lips .
( I think he <unk> within himself to <unk> her if she were left alone . )
“ It was a troubled dream ? ” said Richard , <unk> both my guardian ’ s hands <unk> .
“ Nothing more , Rick ; nothing more . ” “ And you , being a good man , can pass it as such , and forgive and pity the <unk> , and be <unk> and encouraging when he <unk> ? ” “ Indeed I can .
What am I but another <unk> , Rick ? ” “ I will begin the world ! ” said Richard with a light in his eyes .
My husband drew a little nearer towards Ada , and I saw him solemnly lift up his hand to warn my guardian .
“ When shall I go from this place to that pleasant country where the old times are , where I shall have strength to tell what Ada has been to me , where I shall be able to recall my many faults and <unk> , where I shall prepare myself to be a guide to my <unk> child ? ” said Richard .
“ When shall I go ? ” “ Dear Rick , when you are strong enough , ” returned my guardian .
“ Ada , my darling ! ” He sought to raise himself a little .
Allan raised him so that she could hold him on her bosom , which was what he wanted .
“ I have done you many wrongs , my own .
I have fallen like a poor stray shadow on your way , I have married you to <unk> and trouble , I have scattered your means to the winds .
You will forgive me all this , my Ada , before I begin the world ? ” A smile <unk> his face as she bent to kiss him .
He slowly laid his face down upon her bosom , drew his arms closer round her neck , and with one parting sob began the world .
Not this world , oh , not this !
The world that sets this right .
When all was still , at a late hour , poor <unk> Miss Flite came weeping to me and told me she had given her birds their liberty .
CHAPTER <unk> Down in Lincolnshire There is a <unk> upon Chesney Wold in these altered days , as there is upon a portion of the family history .
The story goes that Sir Leicester paid some who could have spoken out to hold their peace ; but it is a lame story , <unk> whispering and creeping about , and any brighter <unk> of life it shows soon dies away .
It is known for certain that the handsome Lady Dedlock lies in the <unk> in the park , where the trees arch <unk> overhead , and the <unk> is heard at night making the woods ring ; but whence she was brought home to be laid among the <unk> of that solitary place , or how she died , is all mystery .
Some of her old friends , principally to be found among the <unk> <unk> with the skeleton throats , did once occasionally say , as they <unk> in a <unk> manner with large <unk> — like <unk> <unk> to <unk> with grim death , after losing all their other <unk> — did once occasionally say , when the world assembled together , that they wondered the ashes of the Dedlocks , <unk> in the <unk> , never rose against the <unk> of her company .
But the <unk> Dedlocks take it very calmly and have never been known to object .
Up from among the fern in the hollow , and winding by the <unk> among the trees , comes sometimes to this lonely spot the sound of horses ’ <unk> .
Then may be seen Sir Leicester — <unk> , bent , and almost blind , but of worthy presence yet — riding with a stalwart man beside him , constant to his <unk> .
When they come to a certain spot before the <unk> , Sir Leicester ’ s accustomed horse stops of his own <unk> , and Sir Leicester , pulling off his hat , is still for a few moments before they ride away .
<unk> <unk> yet with the <unk> Boythorn , though at uncertain intervals , and now <unk> , and now coolly , <unk> like an <unk> fire .
The truth is said to be that when Sir Leicester came down to Lincolnshire for good , Mr. Boythorn showed a <unk> desire to abandon his right of way and do whatever Sir Leicester would , which Sir Leicester , <unk> to be a condescension to his illness or misfortune , took in such high <unk> , and was so <unk> <unk> by , that Mr. Boythorn found himself under the necessity of <unk> a <unk> trespass to restore his <unk> to himself .
<unk> , Mr. Boythorn continues to post tremendous <unk> on the disputed thoroughfare and ( with his bird upon his head ) to hold forth <unk> against Sir Leicester in the sanctuary of his own home ; <unk> , also , he <unk> him as of old in the little church by <unk> a <unk> <unk> of his existence .
But it is whispered that when he is most ferocious towards his old <unk> , he is really most considerate , and that Sir Leicester , in the dignity of being <unk> , little supposes how much he is <unk> .
As little does he think how near together he and his <unk> have suffered in the fortunes of two sisters , and his <unk> , who knows it now , is not the man to tell him .
So the quarrel goes on to the satisfaction of both .
In one of the lodges of the park — that lodge within sight of the house where , once upon a time , when the waters were out down in Lincolnshire , my Lady used to see the keeper ’ s child — the stalwart man , the trooper formerly , is <unk> .
Some <unk> of his old calling hang upon the walls , and these it is the chosen <unk> of a little lame man about the <unk> to keep <unk> bright .
A busy little man he always is , in the <unk> at <unk> doors , of <unk> , bits , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , anything in the way of a <unk> that will take a polish , leading a life of <unk> .
A <unk> little <unk> man , <unk> , not unlike an old dog of some <unk> breed , who has been considerably knocked about .
He answers to the name of Phil .
A goodly sight it is to see the grand old housekeeper ( harder of hearing now ) going to church on the arm of her son and to observe — which few do , for the house is <unk> of company in these times — the relations of both towards Sir Leicester , and his towards them .
They have visitors in the high summer weather , when a grey cloak and umbrella , unknown to Chesney Wold at other periods , are seen among the leaves ; when two young ladies are occasionally found <unk> in <unk> <unk> and such <unk> of the park ; and when the smoke of two pipes <unk> away into the <unk> evening air from the trooper ’ s door .
Then is a fife heard <unk> within the lodge on the <unk> <unk> of the “ British <unk> ” ; and as the evening closes in , a <unk> inflexible voice is heard to say , while two men pace together up and down , “ But I never own to it before the old girl .
Discipline must be maintained . ” The greater part of the house is shut up , and it is a <unk> no longer ; yet Sir Leicester holds his <unk> state in the long drawing-room for all that , and <unk> in his old place before my Lady ’ s picture .
<unk> in by night with broad screens , and <unk> only in that part , the light of the drawing-room seems gradually <unk> and <unk> until it shall be no more .
A little more , in truth , and it will be all <unk> for Sir Leicester ; and the damp door in the <unk> which shuts so tight , and looks so <unk> , will have opened and received him .
Volumnia , growing with the flight of time <unk> as to the red in her face , and <unk> as to the white , reads to Sir Leicester in the long evenings and is driven to various <unk> to conceal her <unk> , of which the chief and most <unk> is the <unk> of the pearl necklace between her rosy lips .
<unk> <unk> on the Buffy and Boodle question , showing how Buffy is <unk> and Boodle <unk> , and how the country is lost by being all Boodle and no Buffy , or saved by being all Buffy and no Boodle ( it must be one of the two , and cannot be anything else ) , are the <unk> of her reading .
Sir Leicester is not particular what it is and does not appear to follow it very closely , further than that he always comes broad awake the moment Volumnia ventures to leave off , and <unk> repeating her last words , begs with some displeasure to know if she finds herself fatigued .
However , Volumnia , in the course of her <unk> hopping about and <unk> at papers , has alighted on a <unk> concerning herself in the event of “ anything <unk> ” to her kinsman , which is handsome <unk> for an <unk> course of reading and holds even the dragon <unk> at <unk> .
The cousins generally are rather shy of Chesney Wold in its <unk> , but take to it a little in the shooting season , when guns are heard in the <unk> , and a few scattered <unk> and <unk> wait at the old places of appointment for low-spirited <unk> and <unk> of cousins .
The debilitated cousin , more debilitated by the <unk> of the place , gets into a fearful state of <unk> , <unk> under <unk> <unk> in his <unk> hours and protesting that such <unk> old <unk> ’ s — <unk> t ’ <unk> fler up — <unk> .
The only great occasions for Volumnia in this changed aspect of the place in Lincolnshire are those occasions , rare and <unk> separated , when something is to be done for the county or the country in the way of <unk> a public ball .
Then , indeed , does the <unk> <unk> come out in fairy form and proceed with joy under cousinly escort to the exhausted old <unk> , <unk> heavy miles off , which , during three hundred and <unk> days and nights of every ordinary year , is a kind of <unk> <unk> full of old chairs and tables <unk> down .
Then , indeed , does she <unk> all hearts by her condescension , by her <unk> <unk> , and by her <unk> about as in the days when the hideous old general with the mouth too full of teeth had not cut one of them at two guineas each .
Then does she <unk> and <unk> , a <unk> <unk> of good family , through the <unk> of the dance .
Then do the <unk> appear with tea , with <unk> , with <unk> , with homage .
Then is she kind and cruel , stately and <unk> , various , <unk> <unk> .
Then is there a singular kind of <unk> between her and the little glass <unk> of another age <unk> that <unk> , which , with their <unk> <unk> , their spare little drops , their <unk> knobs where no drops are , their bare little <unk> from which knobs and drops have both departed , and their little feeble <unk> <unk> , all seem <unk> .
For the rest , Lincolnshire life to Volumnia is a vast blank of <unk> house looking out upon trees , <unk> , <unk> their hands , bowing their heads , and casting their tears upon the <unk> in monotonous <unk> .
A <unk> of grandeur , less the property of an old family of human <unk> and their ghostly <unk> than of an old family of <unk> and <unk> which start out of their hundred graves at every sound and go <unk> through the building .
A waste of <unk> passages and staircases in which to drop a <unk> upon a bedroom floor at night is to send a <unk> <unk> on an errand through the house .
A place where few people care to go about alone , where a maid <unk> if an <unk> drops from the fire , takes to crying at all times and seasons , becomes the victim of a low disorder of the spirits , and gives warning and departs .
Thus Chesney Wold .
With so much of itself abandoned to darkness and <unk> ; with so little change under the summer shining or the wintry lowering ; so <unk> and motionless always — no <unk> flying now by day , no rows of lights sparkling by night ; with no family to come and go , no visitors to be the <unk> of pale cold shapes of rooms , no stir of life about it — passion and pride , even to the stranger ’ s eye , have died away from the place in Lincolnshire and yielded it to dull repose .
CHAPTER <unk> The <unk> of Esther ’ s Narrative <unk> seven happy years I have been the mistress of Bleak House .
The few words that I have to add to what I have written are soon <unk> ; then I and the unknown friend to whom I write will part for ever .
Not without much dear remembrance on my side .
Not without some , I hope , on his or hers .
They gave my darling into my arms , and through many weeks I never left her .
The little child who was to have done so much was born before the turf was planted on its father ’ s grave .
It was a boy ; and I , my husband , and my guardian gave him his father ’ s name .
The help that my dear counted on did come to her , though it came , in the eternal wisdom , for another purpose .
Though to bless and restore his mother , not his father , was the errand of this baby , its power was mighty to do it .
When I saw the strength of the weak little hand and how its touch could <unk> my darling ’ s heart and raised hope within her , I felt a new sense of the goodness and the tenderness of God .
They <unk> , and by degrees I saw my dear girl pass into my country garden and walk there with her infant in her arms .
I was married then .
I was the happiest of the happy .
It was at this time that my guardian joined us and asked Ada when she would come home .
“ Both houses are your home , my dear , ” said he , “ but the older Bleak House claims <unk> .
When you and my boy are strong enough to do it , come and take possession of your home . ” Ada called him “ her dearest cousin , John . ” But he said , no , it must be guardian now .
He was her guardian henceforth , and the boy ’ s ; and he had an old association with the name .
So she called him guardian , and has called him guardian ever since .
The children know him by no other name .
I say the children ; I have two little daughters .
It is difficult to believe that Charley ( <unk> still , and not at all <unk> ) is married to a <unk> in our neighbourhood ; yet so it is ; and even now , looking up from my desk as I write early in the morning at my summer window , I see the very mill beginning to go round .
I hope the <unk> will not spoil Charley ; but he is very fond of her , and Charley is rather vain of such a <unk> , for he is well to do and was in great request .
So far as my small maid is concerned , I might suppose time to have stood for seven years as still as the mill did half an hour ago , since little Emma , Charley ’ s sister , is exactly what Charley used to be .
As to Tom , Charley ’ s brother , I am really afraid to say what he did at school in <unk> , but I think it was <unk> .
He is <unk> to the <unk> , whatever it was , and is a good <unk> fellow , always falling in love with somebody and being ashamed of it .
Caddy Jellyby passed her very last <unk> with us and was a <unk> creature than ever , <unk> dancing in and out of the house with the children as if she had never given a <unk> in her life .
Caddy keeps her own little carriage now instead of <unk> one , and lives full two miles further <unk> than Newman Street .
She works very hard , her husband ( an excellent one ) being lame and able to do very little .
Still , she is more than contented and does all she has to do with all her heart .
Mr. Jellyby <unk> his evenings at her new house with his head against the wall as he used to do in her old one .
I have heard that Mrs. Jellyby was understood to suffer great <unk> from her daughter ’ s <unk> marriage and pursuits , but I hope she got over it in time .
She has been disappointed in Borrioboola-Gha , which turned out a failure in consequence of the king of <unk> wanting to sell everybody — who <unk> the <unk> — for <unk> , but she has taken up with the rights of women to sit in Parliament , and Caddy tells me it is a mission <unk> more correspondence than the old one .
I had almost forgotten Caddy ’ s poor little girl .
She is not such a mite now , but she is deaf and dumb .
I believe there never was a better mother than Caddy , who <unk> , in her <unk> intervals of leisure , innumerable deaf and dumb arts to soften the affliction of her child .
As if I were never to have done with Caddy , I am reminded here of Peepy and old Mr. Turveydrop .
Peepy is in the <unk> House , and doing extremely well .
Old Mr. Turveydrop , very <unk> , still <unk> his deportment about town , still <unk> himself in the old manner , is still believed in in the old way .
He is constant in his patronage of Peepy and is understood to have <unk> him a favourite French clock in his <unk> — which is not his property .
With the first money we saved at home , we added to our pretty house by throwing out a little growlery expressly for my guardian , which we <unk> with great splendour the next time he came down to see us .
I try to write all this lightly , because my heart is full in drawing to an end , but when I write of him , my tears will have their way .
I never look at him but I hear our poor dear Richard calling him a good man .
To Ada and her pretty boy , he is the <unk> father ; to me he is what he has ever been , and what name can I give to that ?
He is my husband ’ s best and dearest friend , he is our children ’ s darling , he is the object of our deepest love and <unk> .
Yet while I feel towards him as if he were a superior being , I am so familiar with him and so easy with him that I almost wonder at myself .
I have never lost my old names , nor has he lost his ; nor do I ever , when he is with us , sit in any other place than in my old chair at his side , Dame Trot , Dame Durden , Little <unk> — all just the same as ever ; and I answer , “ Yes , dear guardian ! ” just the same .
I have never known the wind to be in the east for a single moment since the day when he took me to the porch to read the name .
I remarked to him once that the wind seemed never in the east now , and he said , no , truly ; it had finally departed from that quarter on that very day .
I think my darling girl is more beautiful than ever .
The sorrow that has been in her face — for it is not there now — seems to have <unk> even its innocent expression and to have given it a <unk> quality .
Sometimes when I raise my eyes and see her in the black dress that she still wears , teaching my Richard , I feel — it is difficult to express — as if it were so good to know that she remembers her dear Esther in her prayers .
I call him my Richard !
But he says that he has two <unk> , and I am one .
We are not rich in the bank , but we have always <unk> , and we have quite enough .
I never walk out with my husband but I hear the people bless him .
I never go into a house of any degree but I hear his <unk> or see them in grateful eyes .
I never lie down at night but I know that in the course of that day he has <unk> pain and <unk> some <unk> in the time of need .
I know that from the beds of those who were past recovery , thanks have often , often gone up , in the last hour , for his patient <unk> .
Is not this to be rich ?
The people even praise me as the doctor ’ s wife .
The people even like me as I go about , and make so much of me that I am quite abashed .
I owe it all to him , my love , my pride !
They like me for his sake , as I do everything I do in life for his sake .
A night or two ago , after <unk> about preparing for my darling and my guardian and little Richard , who are coming to-morrow , I was sitting out in the porch of all places , that dearly memorable porch , when Allan came home .
So he said , “ My precious little woman , what are you doing here ? ” And I said , “ The moon is shining so brightly , Allan , and the night is so delicious , that I have been sitting here thinking . ” “ What have you been thinking about , my dear ? ” said Allan then .
“ How curious you are ! ” said I.
“ I am almost ashamed to tell you , but I will .
I have been thinking about my old looks — such as they were . ” “ And what have you been thinking about <unk> , my busy bee ? ” said Allan .
“ I have been thinking that I thought it was impossible that you <unk> have loved me any better , even if I had <unk> them . ” “ ‘ Such as they were ’ ? ” said Allan , laughing .
“ Such as they were , of course . ” “ My dear Dame Durden , ” said Allan , drawing my arm through his , “ do you ever look in the glass ? ” “ You know I do ; you see me do it . ” “ And don ’ t you know that you are <unk> than you ever were ? ” I did not know that ; I am not certain that I know it now .
But I know that my dearest little <unk> are very pretty , and that my darling is very beautiful , and that my husband is very handsome , and that my guardian has the brightest and most benevolent face that ever was seen , and that they can very well do without much beauty in me — even supposing — .
