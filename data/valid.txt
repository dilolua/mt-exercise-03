The <unk> of Esther ’ s Narrative <unk> A Chancery judge once had the kindness to inform me , as one of a company of some hundred and fifty men and women not labouring under any suspicions of lunacy , that the Court of Chancery , though the shining subject of much popular prejudice ( at which point I thought the judge ’ s eye had a cast in my direction ) , was almost <unk> .
There had been , he admitted , a trivial <unk> or so in its rate of progress , but this was <unk> and had been entirely <unk> to the “ <unk> of the public , ” which guilty public , it appeared , had been until lately bent in the most determined manner on by no means <unk> the number of Chancery <unk> appointed — I believe by Richard the Second , but any other king will do as well .
This seemed to me too profound a joke to be <unk> in the body of this book or I should have restored it to Conversation Kenge or to Mr. Vholes , with one or other of whom I think it must have originated .
In such <unk> I might have <unk> it with an apt <unk> from one of <unk> ’ s <unk> : “ My nature is subdued To what it works in , like the <unk> ’ s hand : <unk> me , then , and wish I were renewed ! ” But as it is wholesome that the <unk> public should know what has been doing , and still is doing , in this connexion , I mention here that everything set forth in these pages concerning the Court of Chancery is <unk> true , and within the truth .
The case of Gridley is in no essential altered from one of actual occurrence , made public by a disinterested person who was professionally acquainted with the whole of the monstrous wrong from beginning to end .
At the present moment ( <unk> , <unk> ) there is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago , in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time , in which costs have been <unk> to the amount of seventy thousand pounds , which is A <unk> <unk> , and which is ( I am assured ) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun .
There is another <unk> suit in Chancery , not yet decided , which was commenced before the close of the last century and in which more than double the amount of seventy thousand pounds has been swallowed up in costs .
If I wanted other authorities for Jarndyce and Jarndyce , I could rain them on these pages , to the shame of — a <unk> public .
There is only one other point on which I offer a word of remark .
The possibility of what is called spontaneous combustion has been <unk> since the death of Mr. Krook ; and my good friend Mr. <unk> ( quite mistaken , as he soon found , in supposing the thing to have been abandoned by all authorities ) published some <unk> letters to me at the time when that event was <unk> , arguing that spontaneous combustion could not possibly be .
I have no need to observe that I do not <unk> or <unk> <unk> my <unk> and that before I wrote that description I took pains to <unk> the subject .
There are about thirty cases on <unk> , of which the most famous , that of the <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> , was <unk> <unk> and described by <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> , otherwise distinguished in letters , who published an account of it at <unk> in <unk> , which he afterwards <unk> at <unk> .
The appearances , beyond all <unk> doubt , observed in that case are the appearances observed in Mr. Krook ’ s case .
The next most famous instance happened at <unk> six years earlier , and the <unk> in that case is <unk> <unk> , one of the most <unk> <unk> produced by <unk> .
The subject was a woman , whose husband was <unk> <unk> of having murdered her ; but on solemn appeal to a higher court , he was <unk> because it was shown upon the evidence that she had died the death of which this name of spontaneous combustion is given .
I do not think it necessary to add to these <unk> facts , and that general reference to the authorities which will be found at page <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> . , * the <unk> opinions and experiences of distinguished medical <unk> , French , English , and <unk> , in more <unk> days , <unk> myself with observing that I shall not abandon the facts until there shall have been a considerable spontaneous combustion of the testimony on which human occurrences are usually received .
* * In Bleak House I have purposely dwelt upon the romantic side of familiar things .
<unk> * <unk> ’ s note .
This referred to a <unk> page in the printed book .
In this Project Gutenberg <unk> the <unk> information is in <unk> <unk> , paragraph <unk> .
* * Another case , very clearly described by a <unk> , occurred at the town of <unk> , in the United States of America , quite recently .
The subject was a German who kept a <unk> and was an <unk> <unk> .
CHAPTER I In Chancery London .
<unk> term lately over , and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln ’ s Inn Hall .
<unk> November weather .
As much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth , and it would not be wonderful to meet a <unk> , forty feet long or so , <unk> like an <unk> <unk> up Holborn <unk> .
<unk> lowering down from <unk> , making a soft black <unk> , with <unk> of soot in it as <unk> as <unk> <unk> — gone into mourning , one might imagine , for the death of the sun .
<unk> , <unk> in mire .
<unk> , scarcely better ; <unk> to their very <unk> .
<unk> passengers , <unk> one another ’ s <unk> in a general <unk> of ill temper , and losing their <unk> at <unk> , where tens of thousands of other foot passengers have been <unk> and sliding since the day broke ( if this day ever broke ) , adding new deposits to the <unk> upon <unk> of mud , sticking at those points <unk> to the pavement , and <unk> at compound interest .
Fog everywhere .
Fog up the river , where it <unk> among green <unk> and <unk> ; fog down the river , where it rolls <unk> among the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of a great ( and dirty ) city .
Fog on the <unk> marshes , fog on the <unk> heights .
Fog creeping into the <unk> of <unk> ; fog lying out on the yards and hovering in the <unk> of great ships ; fog drooping on the <unk> of <unk> and small boats .
Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient <unk> <unk> , <unk> by the <unk> of their wards ; fog in the <unk> and <unk> of the afternoon pipe of the <unk> <unk> , down in his close <unk> ; fog <unk> pinching the <unk> and fingers of his shivering little ’ <unk> boy on <unk> .
<unk> people on the bridges peeping over the <unk> into a <unk> sky of fog , with fog all round them , as if they were up in a <unk> and hanging in the <unk> clouds .
<unk> <unk> through the fog in <unk> places in the streets , much as the sun may , from the <unk> fields , be seen to <unk> by <unk> and <unk> .
Most of the shops lighted two hours before their time — as the gas seems to know , for it has a haggard and unwilling look .
The raw afternoon is <unk> , and the dense fog is <unk> , and the muddy streets are <unk> near that <unk> old <unk> , <unk> <unk> for the threshold of a <unk> old <unk> , Temple <unk> .
And hard by Temple <unk> , in Lincoln ’ s Inn Hall , at the very heart of the fog , sits the Lord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery .
Never can there come fog too thick , never can there come mud and mire too deep , to <unk> with the groping and <unk> condition which this High Court of Chancery , most <unk> of <unk> <unk> , holds this day in the sight of heaven and earth .
On such an afternoon , if ever , the Lord High Chancellor ought to be sitting here — as here he is — with a <unk> glory round his head , softly <unk> in with <unk> cloth and curtains , addressed by a large <unk> with great whiskers , a little voice , and an <unk> brief , and outwardly directing his contemplation to the lantern in the roof , where he can see nothing but fog .
On such an afternoon some score of members of the High Court of Chancery bar ought to be — as here they are — <unk> engaged in one of the ten thousand <unk> of an <unk> cause , <unk> one another up on <unk> precedents , groping <unk> in <unk> , running their <unk> and <unk> <unk> heads against walls of words and making a pretence of equity with serious faces , as <unk> might .
On such an afternoon the various solicitors in the cause , some two or three of whom have inherited it from their fathers , who made a fortune by it , ought to be — as are they not ? — <unk> in a line , in a long <unk> well ( but you might look in vain for truth at the bottom of it ) between the <unk> ’ s red table and the silk gowns , with bills , <unk> , answers , <unk> , injunctions , affidavits , <unk> , references to masters , masters ’ reports , mountains of <unk> nonsense , <unk> before them .
Well may the court be dim , with <unk> candles here and there ; well may the fog hang heavy in it , as if it would never get out ; well may the <unk> windows lose their colour and admit no light of day into the place ; well may the <unk> from the streets , who peep in through the glass <unk> in the door , be <unk> from entrance by its <unk> aspect and by the <unk> , languidly echoing to the roof from the <unk> <unk> where the Lord High Chancellor looks into the lantern that has no light in it and where the attendant wigs are all <unk> in a <unk> !
This is the Court of Chancery , which has its decaying houses and its blighted <unk> in every <unk> , which has its <unk> <unk> in every <unk> and its dead in every churchyard , which has its ruined suitor with his <unk> heels and threadbare dress <unk> and begging through the round of every man ’ s acquaintance , which gives to <unk> might the means <unk> of <unk> out the right , which so <unk> <unk> , patience , courage , hope , so <unk> the <unk> and breaks the heart , that there is not an honourable man among its practitioners who would not give — who does not often give — the warning , “ <unk> any wrong that can be done you rather than come here ! ” Who happen to be in the Lord Chancellor ’ s court this <unk> afternoon besides the Lord Chancellor , the counsel in the cause , two or three counsel who are never in any cause , and the well of solicitors before mentioned ?
There is the <unk> below the judge , in wig and gown ; and there are two or three <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> purses , or whatever they may be , in legal court suits .
These are all <unk> , for no <unk> of amusement ever falls from Jarndyce and Jarndyce ( the cause in hand ) , which was squeezed dry years upon years ago .
The <unk> writers , the <unk> of the court , and the <unk> of the newspapers invariably <unk> with the rest of the <unk> when Jarndyce and Jarndyce comes on .
Their places are a blank .
<unk> on a seat at the side of the hall , the better to <unk> into the <unk> sanctuary , is a little mad old woman in a squeezed bonnet who is always in court , from its sitting to its rising , and always expecting some <unk> judgment to be given in her favour .
Some say she really is , or was , a party to a suit , but no one knows for certain because no one cares .
She carries some small litter in a reticule which she calls her documents , principally <unk> of paper <unk> and dry <unk> .
A sallow prisoner has come up , in custody , for the <unk> time to make a personal application “ to <unk> himself of his contempt , ” which , being a solitary <unk> <unk> who has fallen into a state of <unk> about accounts of which it is not pretended that he had ever any knowledge , he is not at all likely ever to do .
In the meantime his prospects in life are ended .
Another ruined suitor , who <unk> appears from Shropshire and breaks out into efforts to address the Chancellor at the close of the day ’ s business and who can by no means be made to understand that the Chancellor is <unk> <unk> of his existence after making it desolate for a quarter of a century , plants himself in a good place and keeps an eye on the judge , ready to call out “ My Lord ! ” in a voice of <unk> complaint on the instant of his rising .
A few lawyers ’ clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger on the chance of his <unk> some <unk> and <unk> the dismal weather a little .
Jarndyce and Jarndyce <unk> on .
This <unk> of a suit has , in course of time , become so <unk> that no man alive knows what it means .
The parties to it understand it least , but it has been observed that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five minutes without coming to a total <unk> as to all the premises .
<unk> children have been born into the cause ; innumerable young people have married into it ; innumerable old people have died out of it .
<unk> of persons have <unk> found themselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce without knowing how or why ; whole families have inherited <unk> <unk> with the suit .
The little <unk> or <unk> who was promised a new <unk> when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled has grown up , possessed himself of a real horse , and <unk> away into the other world .
<unk> wards of court have faded into mothers and <unk> ; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone out ; the <unk> of bills in the suit have been <unk> into mere bills of <unk> ; there are not three <unk> left upon the earth perhaps since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a <unk> in Chancery Lane ; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still <unk> its dreary length before the court , <unk> hopeless .
Jarndyce and Jarndyce has passed into a joke .
That is the only good that has ever come of it .
It has been death to many , but it is a joke in the profession .
Every master in Chancery has had a reference out of it .
Every Chancellor was “ in it , ” for somebody or other , when he was counsel at the bar .
Good things have been said about it by <unk> , <unk> old <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> after dinner in hall .
<unk> clerks have been in the habit of <unk> their legal wit upon it .
The last Lord Chancellor <unk> it neatly , when , correcting Mr. <unk> , the eminent silk gown who said that such a thing might happen when the sky rained potatoes , he observed , “ or when we get through Jarndyce and Jarndyce , Mr. <unk> ” — a <unk> that particularly <unk> the <unk> , bags , and purses .
How many people out of the suit Jarndyce and Jarndyce has stretched forth its unwholesome hand to spoil and <unk> would be a very wide question .
From the master upon whose <unk> <unk> <unk> of dusty <unk> in Jarndyce and Jarndyce have grimly <unk> into many shapes , down to the <unk> in the Six <unk> ’ Office who has copied his tens of thousands of Chancery <unk> under that eternal <unk> , no man ’ s nature has been made better by it .
In <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , under false <unk> of all sorts , there are influences that can never come to good .
The very solicitors ’ boys who have kept the wretched suitors at <unk> , by protesting time out of mind that Mr. <unk> , <unk> , or otherwise was particularly engaged and had <unk> until dinner , may have got an extra moral twist and shuffle into themselves out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
The <unk> in the cause has acquired a goodly sum of money by it but has acquired too a distrust of his own mother and a contempt for his own kind .
<unk> , <unk> , and otherwise have <unk> into a habit of <unk> promising themselves that they will look into that <unk> little matter and see what can be done for <unk> — who was not well used — when Jarndyce and Jarndyce shall be got out of the office .
<unk> and <unk> in all their many <unk> have been <unk> <unk> by the ill-fated cause ; and even those who have contemplated its history from the <unk> circle of such evil have been <unk> tempted into a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad course , and a loose belief that if the world go wrong it was in some off-hand manner never meant to go right .
Thus , in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog , sits the Lord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery .
“ Mr.
Tangle , ” says the Lord High Chancellor , <unk> something restless under the eloquence of that learned gentleman .
“ <unk> , ” says Mr. Tangle .
Mr. Tangle knows more of Jarndyce and Jarndyce than anybody .
He is famous for it — supposed never to have read anything else since he left school .
“ Have you nearly concluded your argument ? ” “ <unk> , no — variety of points — feel it my duty <unk> — <unk> , ” is the reply that <unk> out of Mr. Tangle .
“ Several members of the bar are still to be heard , I believe ? ” says the Chancellor with a slight smile .
<unk> of Mr. Tangle ’ s learned friends , each <unk> with a little <unk> of eighteen hundred sheets , <unk> up like eighteen <unk> in a <unk> , make eighteen bows , and drop into their eighteen places of <unk> .
“ We will proceed with the hearing on Wednesday fortnight , ” says the Chancellor .
For the question at <unk> is only a question of costs , a mere <unk> on the <unk> tree of the parent suit , and really will come to a settlement one of these days .
The Chancellor rises ; the bar rises ; the prisoner is brought forward in a hurry ; the man from Shropshire cries , “ My lord ! ” <unk> , bags , and purses indignantly <unk> silence and frown at the man from Shropshire .
“ In reference , ” proceeds the Chancellor , still on Jarndyce and Jarndyce , “ to the young girl — ” “ <unk> ’ s pardon — boy , ” says Mr. Tangle <unk> .
“ In reference , ” proceeds the Chancellor with extra distinctness , “ to the young girl and boy , the two young people ” — Mr.
Tangle crushed — “ whom I directed to be in attendance to-day and who are now in my private room , I will see them and satisfy myself as to the <unk> of making the order for their residing with their uncle . ” Mr. Tangle on his legs again .
“ <unk> ’ s pardon — dead . ” “ With their ” — Chancellor looking through his double eye-glass at the papers on his desk — “ grandfather . ” “ <unk> ’ s pardon — victim of rash action — brains . ” <unk> a very little counsel with a terrific <unk> voice arises , fully <unk> , in the back <unk> of the fog , and says , “ Will your lordship allow me ?
I appear for him .
He is a cousin , several times removed .
I am not at the moment prepared to inform the court in what exact remove he is a cousin , but he IS a cousin . ” Leaving this address ( delivered like a <unk> message ) ringing in the <unk> of the roof , the very little counsel drops , and the fog knows him no more .
Everybody looks for him .
Nobody can see him .
“ I will speak with both the young people , ” says the Chancellor anew , “ and satisfy myself on the subject of their residing with their cousin .
I will mention the matter to-morrow morning when I take my seat . ” The Chancellor is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is presented .
Nothing can possibly come of the prisoner ’ s <unk> but his being sent back to prison , which is soon done .
The man from Shropshire ventures another <unk> “ My lord ! ” but the Chancellor , being aware of him , has <unk> <unk> .
Everybody else quickly <unk> too .
A <unk> of blue bags is <unk> with heavy charges of papers and carried off by clerks ; the little mad old woman marches off with her documents ; the empty court is locked up .
If all the injustice it has committed and all the misery it has caused could only be locked up with it , and the whole burnt away in a great funeral <unk> — why so much the better for other parties than the parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce !
CHAPTER <unk> In <unk> It is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that we want on this same <unk> afternoon .
It is not so unlike the Court of Chancery but that we may pass from the one scene to the other , as the crow flies .
Both the world of fashion and the Court of Chancery are things of <unk> and <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who have played at strange games through a deal of <unk> weather ; sleeping <unk> whom the <unk> will wake one day , when all the stopped spits in the kitchen shall begin to turn <unk> !
It is not a large world .
<unk> even to this world of ours , which has its limits too ( as your Highness shall find when you have made the <unk> of it and are come to the <unk> of the void beyond ) , it is a very little speck .
There is much good in it ; there are many good and true people in it ; it has its appointed place .
But the evil of it is that it is a world wrapped up in too much <unk> ’ s <unk> and fine <unk> , and cannot hear the rushing of the larger <unk> , and cannot see them as they circle round the sun .
It is a <unk> world , and its growth is sometimes <unk> for want of air .
My Lady Dedlock has returned to her house in town for a few days previous to her departure for Paris , where her ladyship <unk> to stay some weeks , after which her movements are uncertain .
The fashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the <unk> , and it knows all fashionable things .
To know things otherwise were to be <unk> .
My Lady Dedlock has been down at what she calls , in familiar conversation , her “ place ” in Lincolnshire .
The waters are out in Lincolnshire .
An arch of the bridge in the park has been <unk> and <unk> away .
The <unk> <unk> ground for half a mile in breadth is a stagnant river with melancholy trees for <unk> in it and a surface <unk> all over , all day long , with falling rain .
My Lady Dedlock ’ s place has been extremely dreary .
The weather for many a day and night has been so wet that the trees seem wet through , and the soft <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> ’ s <unk> can make no crash or <unk> as they fall .
The <unk> , looking <unk> , leave <unk> where they pass .
The shot of a <unk> <unk> its <unk> in the <unk> air , and its smoke moves in a <unk> little cloud towards the green rise , <unk> , that makes a <unk> for the falling rain .
The view from my Lady Dedlock ’ s own windows is <unk> a <unk> view and a view in <unk> ink .
The <unk> on the stone terrace in the <unk> catch the rain all day ; and the heavy drops fall — drip , drip , drip — upon the broad <unk> pavement , called from old time the Ghost ’ s Walk , all night .
On Sundays the little church in the park is <unk> ; the <unk> <unk> breaks out into a cold <unk> ; and there is a general smell and taste as of the ancient Dedlocks in their graves .
My Lady Dedlock ( who is <unk> ) , looking out in the early twilight from her <unk> at a keeper ’ s lodge and seeing the light of a fire upon the <unk> <unk> , and smoke rising from the chimney , and a child , <unk> by a woman , running out into the rain to meet the shining figure of a <unk> man coming through the gate , has been put quite out of temper .
My Lady Dedlock says she has been “ bored to death . ” Therefore my Lady Dedlock has come away from the place in Lincolnshire and has left it to the rain , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> and <unk> .
The pictures of the Dedlocks past and gone have seemed to <unk> into the damp walls in mere <unk> of spirits , as the housekeeper has passed along the old rooms shutting up the shutters .
And when they will next come forth again , the fashionable intelligence — which , like the <unk> , is <unk> of the past and present , but not the future — cannot yet undertake to say .
Sir Leicester Dedlock is only a baronet , but there is no <unk> baronet than he .
His family is as old as the hills , and infinitely more respectable .
He has a general opinion that the world might get on without hills but would be done up without Dedlocks .
He would on the whole admit nature to be a good idea ( a little low , perhaps , when not enclosed with a <unk> ) , but an idea dependent for its <unk> on your great county families .
He is a gentleman of strict conscience , disdainful of all <unk> and meanness and ready on the <unk> notice to die any death you may please to mention rather than give occasion for the least <unk> of his <unk> .
He is an honourable , obstinate , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , perfectly unreasonable man .
Sir Leicester is twenty years , full measure , older than my Lady .
He will never see <unk> again , nor perhaps <unk> , nor yet <unk> .
He has a twist of the gout now and then and walks a little <unk> .
He is of a worthy presence , with his <unk> hair and whiskers , his fine <unk> , his <unk> waistcoat , and his blue coat with bright buttons always buttoned .
He is <unk> , stately , most polite on every occasion to my Lady , and holds her personal attractions in the highest <unk> .
His gallantry to my Lady , which has never changed since he <unk> her , is the one little touch of romantic fancy in him .
Indeed , he married her for love .
A whisper still goes about that she had not even family ; <unk> , Sir Leicester had so much family that perhaps he had enough and could dispense with any more .
But she had beauty , pride , ambition , <unk> resolve , and sense enough to portion out a <unk> of fine ladies .
<unk> and station , added to these , soon <unk> her upward , and for years now my Lady Dedlock has been at the centre of the fashionable intelligence and at the top of the fashionable tree .
How <unk> wept when he had no more <unk> to conquer , everybody knows — or has some reason to know by this time , the matter having been rather frequently mentioned .
My Lady Dedlock , having <unk> HER world , fell not into the melting , but rather into the <unk> , <unk> .
An exhausted composure , a <unk> <unk> , an <unk> of fatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction , are the <unk> of her <unk> .
She is perfectly <unk> .
If she could be <unk> to heaven to-morrow , she might be expected to <unk> without any rapture .
She has beauty still , and if it be not in its <unk> , it is not yet in its autumn .
She has a fine face — originally of a character that would be rather called very pretty than handsome , but improved into <unk> by the acquired expression of her fashionable state .
Her figure is elegant and has the effect of being tall .
Not that she is so , but that “ the most is made , ” as the Honourable Bob Stables has frequently <unk> upon oath , “ of all her points . ” The same authority observes that she is perfectly got up and remarks in <unk> of her hair especially that she is the <unk> woman in the whole <unk> .
With all her <unk> on her head , my Lady Dedlock has come up from her place in Lincolnshire ( <unk> pursued by the fashionable intelligence ) to pass a few days at her house in town previous to her departure for Paris , where her ladyship <unk> to stay some weeks , after which her movements are uncertain .
And at her house in town , upon this muddy , <unk> afternoon , presents himself an old-fashioned old gentleman , <unk> and <unk> solicitor of the High Court of Chancery , who has the honour of <unk> as legal adviser of the Dedlocks and has as many <unk> boxes in his office with that name outside as if the present baronet were the <unk> of the <unk> ’ s <unk> and were constantly being <unk> through the whole set .
<unk> the hall , and up the stairs , and along the passages , and through the rooms , which are very brilliant in the season and very dismal out of it — <unk> to visit , but a desert to live in — the old gentleman is conducted by a Mercury in powder to my Lady ’ s presence .
The old gentleman is rusty to look at , but is <unk> to have made good <unk> out of aristocratic marriage <unk> and aristocratic wills , and to be very rich .
He is surrounded by a mysterious <unk> of family <unk> , of which he is known to be the silent <unk> .
There are noble <unk> rooted for centuries in retired <unk> of <unk> among the growing timber and the fern , which perhaps hold <unk> noble secrets than walk abroad among men , shut up in the breast of Mr. Tulkinghorn .
He is of what is called the old school — a phrase generally meaning any school that seems never to have been young — and wears <unk> tied with <unk> , and <unk> or stockings .
One <unk> of his black clothes and of his black stockings , be they silk or <unk> , is that they never shine .
<unk> , close , <unk> to any glancing light , his dress is like himself .
He never <unk> when not professionally <unk> .
He is found sometimes , speechless but quite at home , at corners of <unk> in great country houses and near doors of <unk> , concerning which the fashionable intelligence is eloquent , where everybody knows him and where half the <unk> stops to say “ How do you do , Mr. Tulkinghorn ? ” He receives these <unk> with gravity and <unk> them along with the rest of his knowledge .
Sir Leicester Dedlock is with my Lady and is happy to see Mr. Tulkinghorn .
There is an air of <unk> about him which is always agreeable to Sir Leicester ; he receives it as a kind of tribute .
He likes Mr. Tulkinghorn ’ s dress ; there is a kind of tribute in that too .
It is eminently respectable , and likewise , in a general way , <unk> .
It expresses , as it were , the steward of the legal mysteries , the <unk> of the legal cellar , of the Dedlocks .
Has Mr. Tulkinghorn any idea of this himself ?
It may be so , or it may not , but there is this remarkable circumstance to be <unk> in everything associated with my Lady Dedlock as one of a class — as one of the <unk> and <unk> of her little world .
She supposes herself to be an <unk> Being , quite out of the reach and <unk> of ordinary <unk> — seeing herself in her glass , where indeed she looks so .
Yet every dim little star revolving about her , from her maid to the <unk> of the Italian <unk> , knows her weaknesses , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> and lives upon as <unk> a calculation and as nice a measure of her moral nature as her <unk> takes of her physical proportions .
Is a new dress , a new custom , a new <unk> , a new <unk> , a new form of <unk> , a new <unk> or giant , a new <unk> , a new anything , to be set up ?
There are deferential people in a dozen <unk> whom my Lady Dedlock suspects of nothing but <unk> before her , who can tell you how to manage her as if she were a baby , who do nothing but nurse her all their lives , who , <unk> affecting to follow with profound <unk> , lead her and her whole <unk> after them ; who , in <unk> one , hook all and bear them off as <unk> <unk> bore away the stately <unk> of the majestic <unk> .
“ If you want to address our people , sir , ” say <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> — meaning by our people Lady Dedlock and the rest — “ you must remember that you are not dealing with the general public ; you must <unk> our people in their <unk> place , and their <unk> place is such a place . ” “ To make this article go down , gentlemen , ” say Sheen and Gloss , the <unk> , to their friends the <unk> , “ you must come to us , because we know where to have the fashionable people , and we can make it fashionable . ” “ If you want to get this print upon the tables of my high connexion , sir , ” says Mr. Sladdery , the <unk> , “ or if you want to get this <unk> or giant into the houses of my high connexion , sir , or if you want to <unk> to this entertainment the patronage of my high connexion , sir , you must leave it , if you please , to me , for I have been accustomed to study the <unk> of my high connexion , sir , and I may tell you without <unk> that I can turn them round my finger ” — in which Mr. Sladdery , who is an honest man , does not <unk> at all .
Therefore , while Mr. Tulkinghorn may not know what is passing in the Dedlock mind at present , it is very possible that he may .
“ My Lady ’ s cause has been again before the Chancellor , has it , Mr. Tulkinghorn ? ” says Sir Leicester , giving him his hand .
“ Yes .
It has been on again to-day , ” Mr. Tulkinghorn replies , making one of his quiet bows to my Lady , who is on a sofa near the fire , shading her face with a <unk> .
“ It would be useless to ask , ” says my Lady with the <unk> of the place in Lincolnshire still upon her , “ whether anything has been done . ” “ Nothing that YOU would call anything has been done to-day , ” replies Mr. Tulkinghorn .
“ Nor ever will be , ” says my Lady .
Sir Leicester has no objection to an <unk> Chancery suit .
It is a slow , expensive , British , <unk> kind of thing .
To be sure , he has not a <unk> interest in the suit in question , her part in which was the only property my Lady brought him ; and he has a shadowy impression that for his name — the name of Dedlock — to be in a cause , and not in the title of that cause , is a most ridiculous accident .
But he regards the Court of Chancery , even if it should involve an occasional delay of justice and a trifling amount of confusion , as a something <unk> in <unk> with a variety of other <unk> by the perfection of human wisdom for the eternal settlement ( <unk> speaking ) of everything .
And he is upon the whole of a fixed opinion that to give the <unk> of his countenance to any <unk> respecting it would be to encourage some person in the lower classes to rise up somewhere — like Wat Tyler .
“ As a few fresh affidavits have been put upon the file , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “ and as they are short , and as I proceed upon the troublesome principle of begging leave to possess my clients with any new proceedings in a cause ” — <unk> man Mr. Tulkinghorn , taking no more responsibility than necessary — “ and further , as I see you are going to Paris , I have brought them in my pocket . ” ( Sir Leicester was going to Paris too , by the by , but the delight of the fashionable intelligence was in his Lady . )
Mr. Tulkinghorn takes out his papers , asks permission to place them on a golden <unk> of a table at my Lady ’ s elbow , puts on his spectacles , and begins to read by the light of a shaded lamp .
“ ‘ In Chancery .
Between John Jarndyce — ’ ” My Lady interrupts , <unk> him to miss as many of the formal horrors as he can .
Mr. Tulkinghorn glances over his spectacles and begins again lower down .
My Lady carelessly and <unk> <unk> her attention .
Sir Leicester in a great chair looks at the file and appears to have a stately liking for the legal <unk> and <unk> as <unk> among the national <unk> .
It happens that the fire is hot where my Lady sits and that the <unk> is more beautiful than useful , being <unk> but small .
My Lady , changing her position , sees the papers on the table — looks at them nearer — looks at them nearer still — asks <unk> , “ Who copied that ? ” Mr. Tulkinghorn stops short , surprised by my Lady ’ s animation and her unusual tone .
“ Is it what you people call <unk> ? ” she asks , looking full at him in her careless way again and <unk> with her screen .
“ Not quite .
Probably ” — Mr.
Tulkinghorn examines it as he speaks — “ the legal character which it has was acquired after the original hand was formed .
Why do you ask ? ” “ Anything to <unk> this <unk> <unk> .
Oh , go on , do ! ” Mr. Tulkinghorn reads again .
The heat is greater ; my Lady screens her face .
Sir Leicester <unk> , starts up suddenly , and cries , “ Eh ?
What do you say ? ” “ I say I am afraid , ” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , who had risen hastily , “ that Lady Dedlock is ill . ” “ <unk> , ” my Lady murmurs with white lips , “ only that ; but it is like the <unk> of death .
Don ’ t speak to me .
<unk> , and take me to my room ! ” Mr. Tulkinghorn retires into another chamber ; bells ring , feet shuffle and <unk> , silence <unk> .
Mercury at last begs Mr. Tulkinghorn to return .
“ Better now , ” quoth Sir Leicester , <unk> the lawyer to sit down and read to him alone .
“ I have been quite alarmed .
I never knew my Lady <unk> before .
But the weather is extremely trying , and she really has been bored to death down at our place in Lincolnshire . ” CHAPTER <unk> A <unk> I have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write my portion of these pages , for I know I am not clever .
I always knew that .
I can remember , when I was a very little girl indeed , I used to say to my doll when we were alone together , “ Now , Dolly , I am not clever , you know very well , and you must be patient with me , like a dear ! ” And so she used to sit <unk> up in a great arm-chair , with her beautiful complexion and rosy lips , staring at me — or not so much at me , I think , as at nothing — while I busily <unk> away and told her every one of my secrets .
My dear old doll !
I was such a shy little thing that I seldom dared to open my lips , and never dared to open my heart , to anybody else .
It almost makes me cry to think what a relief it used to be to me when I came home from school of a day to run upstairs to my room and say , “ Oh , you dear faithful Dolly , I knew you would be expecting me ! ” and then to sit down on the floor , leaning on the elbow of her great chair , and tell her all I had noticed since we parted .
I had always rather a noticing way — not a quick way , oh , no ! — a silent way of noticing what passed before me and thinking I should like to understand it better .
I have not by any means a quick understanding .
When I love a person very tenderly indeed , it seems to brighten .
But even that may be my <unk> .
I was brought up , from my <unk> remembrance — like some of the <unk> in the fairy stories , only I was not charming — by my godmother .
At least , I only knew her as such .
She was a good , good woman !
She went to church three times every Sunday , and to morning prayers on <unk> and <unk> , and to lectures whenever there were lectures ; and never missed .
She was handsome ; and if she had ever smiled , would have been ( I used to think ) like an angel — but she never smiled .
She was always grave and strict .
She was so very good herself , I thought , that the <unk> of other people made her frown all her life .
I felt so different from her , even making every allowance for the <unk> between a child and a woman ; I felt so poor , so trifling , and so far off that I never could be <unk> with her — no , could never even love her as I wished .
It made me very sorry to consider how good she was and how <unk> of her I was , and I used <unk> to hope that I might have a better heart ; and I talked it over very often with the dear old doll , but I never loved my godmother as I ought to have loved her and as I felt I must have loved her if I had been a better girl .
This made me , I dare say , more timid and retiring than I naturally was and cast me upon Dolly as the only friend with whom I felt at ease .
But something happened when I was still quite a little thing that helped it very much .
I had never heard my mama spoken of .
I had never heard of my papa either , but I felt more interested about my mama .
I had never worn a black frock , that I could recollect .
I had never been shown my mama ’ s grave .
I had never been told where it was .
Yet I had never been taught to pray for any relation but my godmother .
I had more than once approached this subject of my thoughts with Mrs. Rachael , our only servant , who took my light away when I was in bed ( another very good woman , but <unk> to me ) , and she had only said , “ Esther , good night ! ” and gone away and left me .
Although there were seven girls at the neighbouring school where I was a day <unk> , and although they called me little Esther Summerson , I knew none of them at home .
All of them were older than I , to be sure ( I was the youngest there by a good deal ) , but there seemed to be some other separation between us besides that , and besides their being far more clever than I was and knowing much more than I did .
One of them in the first week of my going to the school ( I remember it very well ) invited me home to a little party , to my great joy .
But my godmother wrote a stiff letter <unk> for me , and I never went .
I never went out at all .
It was my birthday .
There were <unk> at school on other <unk> — none on mine .
There were <unk> at home on other <unk> , as I knew from what I heard the girls relate to one another — there were none on mine .
My birthday was the most melancholy day at home in the whole year .
I have mentioned that unless my <unk> should deceive me ( as I know it may , for I may be very vain without <unk> it , though indeed I don ’ t ) , my comprehension is quickened when my affection is .
My disposition is very affectionate , and perhaps I might still feel such a wound if such a wound could be received more than once with the quickness of that birthday .
<unk> was over , and my godmother and I were sitting at the table before the fire .
The clock <unk> , the fire <unk> ; not another sound had been heard in the room or in the house for I don ’ t know how long .
I happened to look timidly up from my <unk> , across the table at my godmother , and I saw in her face , looking gloomily at me , “ It would have been far better , little Esther , that you had had no birthday , that you had never been born ! ” I broke out crying and sobbing , and I said , “ Oh , dear godmother , tell me , pray do tell me , did <unk> die on my birthday ? ” “ No , ” she returned .
“ Ask me no more , child ! ” “ Oh , do pray tell me something of her .
Do now , at last , dear godmother , if you please !
What did I do to her ?
How did I lose her ?
Why am I so different from other children , and why is it my fault , dear godmother ?
No , no , no , don ’ t go away .
Oh , speak to me ! ” I was in a kind of fright beyond my grief , and I caught hold of her dress and was <unk> to her .
She had been saying all the while , “ Let me go ! ” But now she stood still .
Her darkened face had such power over me that it stopped me in the midst of my vehemence .
I put up my trembling little hand to <unk> hers or to beg her pardon with what earnestness I might , but withdrew it as she looked at me , and laid it on my fluttering heart .
She raised me , sat in her chair , and standing me before her , said slowly in a cold , low voice — I see her <unk> brow and pointed finger — “ Your mother , Esther , is your disgrace , and you were hers .
The time will come — and soon enough — when you will understand this better and will feel it too , as no one save a woman can .
I have <unk> her ” — but her face did not <unk> — “ the wrong she did to me , and I say no more of it , though it was greater than you will ever know — than any one will ever know but I , the <unk> .
For yourself , unfortunate girl , <unk> and <unk> from the first of these evil <unk> , pray daily that the sins of others be not visited upon your head , according to what is written .
<unk> your mother and leave all other people to forget her who will do her unhappy child that greatest kindness .
Now , go ! ” She checked me , however , as I was about to depart from her — so frozen as I was ! — and added this , “ <unk> , <unk> , diligent work , are the preparations for a life begun with such a shadow on it .
You are different from other children , Esther , because you were not born , like them , in common <unk> and <unk> .
You are set apart . ” I went up to my room , and crept to bed , and laid my doll ’ s cheek against mine wet with tears , and holding that solitary friend upon my bosom , cried myself to sleep .
<unk> as my understanding of my sorrow was , I knew that I had brought no joy at any time to anybody ’ s heart and that I was to no one upon earth what Dolly was to me .
Dear , dear , to think how much time we passed alone together afterwards , and how often I repeated to the doll the story of my birthday and confided to her that I would try as hard as ever I could to repair the fault I had been born with ( of which I <unk> felt guilty and yet innocent ) and would <unk> as I grew up to be industrious , contented , and <unk> and to do some good to some one , and win some love to myself if I could .
I hope it is not <unk> to shed these tears as I think of it .
I am very thankful , I am very cheerful , but I cannot quite help their coming to my eyes .
There !
I have <unk> them away now and can go on again <unk> .
I felt the distance between my godmother and myself so much more after the birthday , and felt so sensible of filling a place in her house which ought to have been empty , that I found her more difficult of approach , though I was <unk> grateful to her in my heart , than ever .
I felt in the same way towards my school companions ; I felt in the same way towards Mrs. Rachael , who was a widow ; and oh , towards her daughter , of whom she was proud , who came to see her once a fortnight !
I was very retired and quiet , and tried to be very diligent .
One sunny afternoon when I had come home from school with my books and <unk> , watching my long shadow at my side , and as I was gliding upstairs to my room as usual , my godmother looked out of the <unk> and called me back .
<unk> with her , I found — which was very unusual indeed — a stranger .
A <unk> , <unk> gentleman , dressed all in black , with a white cravat , large gold watch <unk> , a pair of gold eye-glasses , and a large <unk> upon his little finger .
“ This , ” said my godmother in an <unk> , “ is the child . ” Then she said in her naturally stern way of speaking , “ This is Esther , sir . ” The gentleman put up his eye-glasses to look at me and said , “ Come here , my dear ! ” He shook hands with me and asked me to take off my bonnet , looking at me all the while .
When I had <unk> , he said , “ Ah ! ” and afterwards “ Yes ! ” And then , taking off his eye-glasses and folding them in a red case , and leaning back in his arm-chair , turning the case about in his two hands , he gave my godmother a nod .
Upon that , my godmother said , “ You may go upstairs , Esther ! ” And I made him my curtsy and left him .
It must have been two years afterwards , and I was almost <unk> , when one dreadful night my godmother and I sat at the fireside .
I was reading aloud , and she was listening .
I had come down at nine o ’ clock as I always did to read the <unk> to her , and was reading from St. John how our <unk> stooped down , writing with his finger in the dust , when they brought the <unk> woman to him .
“ So when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself and said unto them , ‘ He that is without <unk> among you , let him first cast a stone at her ! ’ ” I was stopped by my godmother ’ s rising , putting her hand to her head , and crying out in an awful voice from quite another part of the book , “ ‘ Watch ye , therefore , lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping .
And what I say unto you , I say unto all , Watch ! ’ ” In an instant , while she stood before me repeating these words , she fell down on the floor .
I had no need to cry out ; her voice had sounded through the house and been heard in the street .
She was laid upon her bed .
For more than a week she lay there , little altered outwardly , with her old handsome resolute frown that I so well knew <unk> upon her face .
Many and many a time , in the day and in the night , with my head upon the pillow by her that my whispers might be plainer to her , I kissed her , thanked her , prayed for her , asked her for her blessing and forgiveness , entreated her to give me the least sign that she knew or heard me .
No , no , no .
Her face was immovable .
To the very last , and even afterwards , her frown remained <unk> .
On the day after my poor good godmother was buried , the gentleman in black with the white <unk> <unk> .
I was sent for by Mrs. Rachael , and found him in the same place , as if he had never gone away .
“ My name is Kenge , ” he said ; “ you may remember it , my child ; Kenge and Carboy , Lincoln ’ s Inn . ” I replied that I remembered to have seen him once before .
“ Pray be seated — here near me .
Don ’ t distress yourself ; it ’ s of no use .
Mrs. Rachael , I needn ’ t inform you who were acquainted with the late Miss Barbary ’ s affairs , that her means die with her and that this young lady , now her aunt is dead — ” “ My aunt , sir ! ” “ It is really of no use carrying on a <unk> when no object is to be gained by it , ” said Mr. Kenge smoothly , “ <unk> in fact , though not in law .
Don ’ t distress yourself !
Don ’ t <unk> !
Don ’ t tremble !
Mrs. Rachael , our young friend has no doubt heard of — the — a — Jarndyce and Jarndyce . ” “ Never , ” said Mrs. Rachael .
“ Is it possible , ” pursued Mr. Kenge , putting up his eye-glasses , “ that our young friend — I <unk> you won ’ t distress yourself ! — never heard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce ! ” I shook my head , wondering even what it was .
“ Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce ? ” said Mr. Kenge , looking over his glasses at me and softly turning the case about and about as if he were <unk> something .
“ Not of one of the greatest Chancery suits known ?
Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce — the — a — in itself a monument of Chancery practice .
In which ( I would say ) every difficulty , every <unk> , every masterly fiction , every form of <unk> known in that court , is represented over and over again ?
It is a cause that could not <unk> out of this free and great country .
I should say that the <unk> of costs in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , Mrs. Rachael ” — I was afraid he addressed himself to her because I appeared <unk> — “ <unk> at the present hour to from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> ! ” said Mr. Kenge , leaning back in his chair .
I felt very <unk> , but what could I do ?
I was so entirely <unk> with the subject that I understood nothing about it even then .
“ And she really never heard of the cause ! ” said Mr. Kenge .
“ <unk> ! ” “ Miss Barbary , sir , ” returned Mrs. Rachael , “ who is now among the <unk> — ” “ I hope so , I am sure , ” said Mr. Kenge politely .
“ — <unk> Esther only to know what would be serviceable to her .
And she knows , from any teaching she has had here , nothing more . ” “ Well ! ” said Mr. Kenge .
“ Upon the whole , very proper .
Now to the point , ” addressing me .
“ Miss Barbary , your sole relation ( in fact that is , for I am bound to observe that in law you had none ) being deceased and it naturally not being to be expected that Mrs. Rachael — ” “ Oh , dear no ! ” said Mrs. Rachael quickly .
“ Quite so , ” assented Mr. Kenge ; “ — that Mrs. Rachael should charge herself with your <unk> and support ( I beg you won ’ t distress yourself ) , you are in a position to receive the <unk> of an offer which I was <unk> to make to Miss Barbary some two years ago and which , though <unk> then , was understood to be <unk> under the <unk> circumstances that have since occurred .
Now , if I <unk> that I represent , in Jarndyce and Jarndyce and otherwise , a highly <unk> , but at the same time singular , man , shall I compromise myself by any stretch of my professional caution ? ” said Mr. Kenge , leaning back in his chair again and looking calmly at us both .
He appeared to enjoy beyond everything the sound of his own voice .
I couldn ’ t wonder at that , for it was <unk> and full and gave great importance to every word he uttered .
He listened to himself with <unk> satisfaction and sometimes gently beat time to his own music with his head or <unk> a sentence with his hand .
I was very much impressed by him — even then , before I knew that he formed himself on the model of a great lord who was his client and that he was generally called Conversation Kenge .
“ Mr.
Jarndyce , ” he pursued , “ being aware of the — I would say , desolate — position of our young friend , offers to place her at a first-rate establishment where her education shall be completed , where her comfort shall be secured , where her reasonable wants shall be anticipated , where she shall be eminently <unk> to discharge her duty in that station of life unto which it has pleased — shall I say <unk> ? — to call her . ” My heart was filled so full , both by what he said and by his affecting manner of saying it , that I was not able to speak , though I tried .
“ Mr.
Jarndyce , ” he went on , “ makes no condition beyond expressing his expectation that our young friend will not at any time remove herself from the establishment in question without his knowledge and <unk> .
That she will faithfully apply herself to the <unk> of those <unk> , upon the exercise of which she will be <unk> dependent .
That she will tread in the <unk> of virtue and honour , and — the — a — — so forth . ” I was still less able to speak than before .
“ Now , what does our young friend say ? ” proceeded Mr. Kenge .
“ Take time , take time !
I pause for her reply .
But take time ! ” What the <unk> subject of such an offer tried to say , I need not repeat .
What she did say , I could more easily tell , if it were worth the telling .
What she felt , and will feel to her dying hour , I could never relate .
This interview took place at <unk> , where I had passed ( as far as I knew ) my whole life .
On that day week , <unk> provided with all <unk> , I left it , inside the <unk> , for Reading .
Mrs. Rachael was too good to feel any emotion at parting , but I was not so good , and wept bitterly .
I thought that I ought to have known her better after so many years and ought to have made myself enough of a favourite with her to make her sorry then .
When she gave me one cold parting kiss upon my forehead , like a <unk> from the stone porch — it was a very frosty day — I felt so miserable and <unk> that I clung to her and told her it was my fault , I knew , that she could say good-bye so easily !
“ No , Esther ! ” she returned .
“ It is your misfortune ! ” The coach was at the little <unk> — we had not come out until we heard the wheels — and thus I left her , with a sorrowful heart .
She went in before my boxes were lifted to the <unk> and shut the door .
As long as I could see the house , I looked back at it from the window through my tears .
My godmother had left Mrs. Rachael all the little property she possessed ; and there was to be a <unk> ; and an old <unk> with roses on it , which always seemed to me the first thing in the world I had ever seen , was hanging outside in the <unk> and snow .
A day or two before , I had wrapped the dear old doll in her own shawl and quietly laid her — I am half ashamed to tell it — in the <unk> under the tree that shaded my old window .
I had no companion left but my bird , and him I carried with me in his <unk> .
When the house was out of sight , I sat , with my <unk> in the straw at my feet , forward on the low seat to look out of the high window , watching the frosty trees , that were like beautiful pieces of <unk> , and the fields all smooth and white with last night ’ s snow , and the sun , so red but yielding so little heat , and the <unk> , dark like metal where the <unk> and <unk> had brushed the snow away .
There was a gentleman in the coach who sat on the opposite seat and looked very large in a quantity of <unk> , but he sat <unk> out of the other window and took no notice of me .
I thought of my dead godmother , of the night when I read to her , of her frowning so fixedly and sternly in her bed , of the strange place I was going to , of the people I should find there , and what they would be like , and what they would say to me , when a voice in the coach gave me a terrible start .
It said , “ What the <unk> are you crying for ? ” I was so frightened that I lost my voice and could only answer in a whisper , “ Me , sir ? ” For of course I knew it must have been the gentleman in the quantity of <unk> , though he was still looking out of his window .
“ Yes , you , ” he said , turning round .
“ I didn ’ t know I was crying , sir , ” I <unk> .
“ But you are ! ” said the gentleman .
“ Look here ! ” He came quite opposite to me from the other corner of the coach , brushed one of his large <unk> <unk> across my eyes ( but without hurting me ) , and showed me that it was wet .
“ There !
